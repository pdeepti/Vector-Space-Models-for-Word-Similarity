the gamekeepers have described the practice as cruel and immoral and they plan to petition the parliament for action .
gamekeepers and stalkers have permission to shoot red deer over the winter to help control their numbers .
the season ends later this week but the deer commission for scotland does allow some out of season shooting under licence .
it 's a pretty horrible job to do but there are not enough people to control the deer in the open season archie dykes , gamekeeper gamekeepers allege that this means that many deer are being shot when they are heavily pregnant .
archie dykes , who works as a gamekeeper on glen dye in aberdeenshire , said some deer are shot , under licence , out of season due to a lack of manpower during the shooting season .
he said : " more and more people are complaining about the number of deer shot out of season .
" heavily pregnant deer are being shot in june and july which means deer calves are being left to starve to death .
" it 's a pretty horrible job to do but there are not enough people on the ground to control the deer in the recognised open seasons . "
but the deer commission for scotland said that only a small percentage of deer can be culled out of season and only under strict authorisation .
in 2001 , 76,000 red deer were culled , about 1,400 of them out of season - less than 2 % .
the commission 's director , nick reiter , said its policy is for people to shoot responsibly , preferably within the season .
he said : " any responsible stalker knows how to cull deer , knows that if it is necessary to cull a deer with a calf that you do not leave the calf to suffer and die a lingering death .
" i do n't know that coming at it from an emotive , subjective , and in many cases inaccurate point of view , helps anyone . "
the scottish gamekeepers association wants the scottish parliament to order an independent inquiry into the issue as soon as possible .

but tighter regulations and licensing arrangements mean many must wait several more days before they can resume business .
new rules mean that marts must keep records of everyone who enters the premises and all visitors must wash their boots and vehicles .
even a £ 3m new mart at carmarthen in west wales - the most modern in europe - has been told it will need a ministry licensing inspection before business can re-start .
with no new foot-and-mouth outbreaks since the end of september , uk food and farming minister lord whitty and assembly rural affairs minister carwyn jones have decided that it will be safe to allow farmers to resume normal livestock dealing at marts .
livestock markets are a cornerstone for meat producers but empty pens have become familiar sights at venues all over wales since the disease took hold .
stricter rules on bio-security have been brought in aimed at preventing any further possible outbreaks .
while there is some frustration at even a few days ' extra delay , most marts are expected to get the go-ahead later this week .
the rules also involve the security of the animals themselves - the details on their animal passports must be logged - and those about the fabric of the buildings which must have no cracks in concrete flooring and all-steel pens for ease of cleansing and disinfection .
marts must submit to an inspection by the rural affairs minstry defra before a licence can be granted .
the first foot-and-mouth case was declared in wales on 27 february 2001 and the outbreak reached its peak at the end of march .
