in doing so , the company is returning to its traditional roots . more than a month after letting go of freewheeling ceo thomas middelhoff , german media giant bertelsmann is well on its way through a substantial consolidation .
on tuesday , bertelsmann posted operating profits in the first half of 2002 of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- .
the figure was a vast improvement over the first half of 2001 , when bertelsmann posted losses of more than 800 million euro -lrb- $ 793 million -rrb- .
the figures , announced by new ceo gunter thielen , are encouraging even if they are more attributable to middelhoff than the new regime .
like middelhoff , thielen said bertelsmann was going to focus on the tradional media that brought the 167-year-old concern to where it is today .
the concern 's successful television wing , which includes germany 's rtl channel , will play a large role in trimming bertelsmann 's losses .
as part of the consolidation , bertelsmann is casting off money-losing online retailers for which middelhoff had great hopes .
the company said this week it is looking for buyers for bol.com , an online book retailer .
bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .
thielen is also restructuring the top level of bertelsmann management and decentralizing a firm that middelhoff labored to develop into an integrated corporation .

but a plan to expand renewable energies promoted by germany has been watered down . u.n. secretary general kofi annan and south african president thabo mbeki welcomed heads of states on monday , urging them to emerge from this earth summit with real commitments , targets and timetables to reduce poverty worldwide and protect the environment .
with most of the key issues like biodiversity , water and sanitation targets agreed to , negotiators overnight failed to solve remaining sticking points on energy and globalization despite summit president mbeki urging delegates to commit to real action .
schröder pledges one billion euro for clean energy german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- was one of the first of the 109 world leaders to speak and to offer solid action on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he referred to germany 's devastating floods as an example of the extreme weather conditions the world will face if more is n't done to address the issue of climate change .
the european union , which has ratified the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide , is pressuring russia and other countries to ratify the treaty so that it can come into force .
" these challenges force us to negotiate for our natural environment and the future of our children , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told the delegates .
" that 's why the conference should urge all states to ratify the kyoto protocol as soon as possible so that it can come into force this year .
and , in particular , the wealthy states and industrial countries of this world have a special responsibility for the ratification of this protocol . "
by tuesday , canada , china and russia said they would seek to ratify kyoto by the end of the year , which would give the treaty enough signatories to be enacted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one of the biggest concrete aid pledges to be unveiled so far at the johannesburg summit , schröder on monday announced a five-year , one billion euro plan to help developing nations expand their usage of renewable energies .
schröder : open markets to developing countries schröder also alluded to the contentious issue of agricultural subsidies , calling on all developed countries to reduce subsidies that prevent developing nations from accessing western markets .
his sentiments were echoed by british prime minister tony blair .

the usa and other oil-producing nations managed to keep strict targets out of the final agreement .
germany had been the main proponent of the renewable energy initiative , and the failure to set a 15-percent goal dealt a setback to the delegation .
on tuesday , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul scoffed at the u.s. 's recalcitrance , criticizing the " frightful near-sightedness of the opec nations and the usa , which are attached to dinosaur thinking that is n't compatible with the future . "
german environmental activists also lamented the compromise .

the european union , which has ratified the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide , is pressuring russia and other countries to ratify the treaty so that it can come into force .
" these challenges force us to negotiate for our natural environment and the future of our children , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told the delegates .
" that 's why the conference should urge all states to ratify the kyoto protocol as soon as possible so that it can come into force this year .
and , in particular , the wealthy states and industrial countries of this world have a special responsibility for the ratification of this protocol . "
by tuesday , canada , china and russia said they would seek to ratify kyoto by the end of the year , which would give the treaty enough signatories to be enacted .

the usa and other oil-producing nations managed to keep strict targets out of the final agreement .
germany had been the main proponent of the renewable energy initiative , and the failure to set a 15-percent goal dealt a setback to the delegation .
on tuesday , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul scoffed at the u.s. 's recalcitrance , criticizing the " frightful near-sightedness of the opec nations and the usa , which are attached to dinosaur thinking that is n't compatible with the future . "
german environmental activists also lamented the compromise .

in doing so , the company is returning to its traditional roots . more than a month after letting go of freewheeling ceo thomas middelhoff , german media giant bertelsmann is well on its way through a substantial consolidation .
on tuesday , bertelsmann posted operating profits in the first half of 2002 of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- .
the figure was a vast improvement over the first half of 2001 , when bertelsmann posted losses of more than 800 million euro -lrb- $ 793 million -rrb- .
the figures , announced by new ceo gunter thielen , are encouraging even if they are more attributable to middelhoff than the new regime .
like middelhoff , thielen said bertelsmann was going to focus on the tradional media that brought the 167-year-old concern to where it is today .
the concern 's successful television wing , which includes germany 's rtl channel , will play a large role in trimming bertelsmann 's losses .
as part of the consolidation , bertelsmann is casting off money-losing online retailers for which middelhoff had great hopes .
the company said this week it is looking for buyers for bol.com , an online book retailer .
bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .
thielen is also restructuring the top level of bertelsmann management and decentralizing a firm that middelhoff labored to develop into an integrated corporation .

but the internet has made it possible for him to work as a journalist with much greater ease .
that 's not always the case , however .
sometimes the special screen reader software installed on his computer conks out – a situation usually caused by web pages that lack basic text descriptions of images and icons , which are supposed to be a standard component of web coding .
" once i was on a site called " travel for the disabled , " klaus says .
" but it was programmed in a way that you could n't read it .
i even took the trouble to call them up and tell them about the problem , but they still have n't changed the site . "
and that irritates klaus , because surfing is all he wants to do .
the internet is supposed to make everyday life simpler for everyone , but when content providers take short cuts on their coding , it can keep blind users like klaus in the dark .
screen readers for the visually impaired for several years now , new software programs have made it easier for the blind to surf the internet .
a so-called screen reader reads the text of each web page using a synthesized computer voice .
sometimes the voice can sound a bit rattling , but the digital reading machines do make it possible for blind people to find their way onto the internet .
text descriptions embedded into the html code of a web page 's features also make it possible for the blind to recognize icons or graphics that would normally appear on screen .
in addition to screen readers , there are also software programs designed to make internet access easier for people with other disabilities .
some programs make it possible for people who ca n't , for example , use a mouse to instead work exclusively with a keyboard .
for older people with diminished or otherwise impaired vision , software is also available that renders web pages in large type .
making the web safe for the disabled yet despite such advances , there is still much work to be done .
" it would be nice if i were able to access my bank online so that i would n't have to have someone read my bank statements to me anymore , " klaus says .
" then i would n't have to feel as naked as i do now . "
but banks are n't the only companies whose web sites tend to be rendered unreadable by software designed for making the internet accessible to people with vision loss or other impairments .
due to the heavy use of set colors , forms and graphics , the special software is often unable to read pages .
" if a web designer is set on offering web content in a specific font or type size , then he 's going to have a problem creating barrier-free offerings , " says henrike gappa of the fraunhofer institute for applied information technologies in st. augustin .
scientists at the institute are working with companies and the government to help them create web pages that are n't plagued with access barriers .
in the past , many companies have avoided offering web pages designed for people with disabilities because they feared that doing so would incur additional development costs .
but that 's a prejudice researchers at the fraunhofer institute are eager to eliminate .
they say it is unnecessary to create special pages for people with disabilities .
it suffices to follow the basic rules of good web design and to create a single type of web page that is accessible to all .
it 's simple : images on web pages should always use html standard descriptor tags , and complicated elements should be avoided if no simpler alternative is made available simultaneously .
" we 're trying to train web designers , companies and government authorities on how they can create pages that are accessible using every type of internet software , " grappa says .
and though private companies ca n't be forced to do so , grappa notes , government agencies are required to make their pages accessible to the disabled . sönje storm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fraunhofer institute for applied information technology more information about the fraunhofer institute 's efforts in promoting a barrier-free internet .

in doing so , the company is returning to its traditional roots . more than a month after letting go of freewheeling ceo thomas middelhoff , german media giant bertelsmann is well on its way through a substantial consolidation .
on tuesday , bertelsmann posted operating profits in the first half of 2002 of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- .
the figure was a vast improvement over the first half of 2001 , when bertelsmann posted losses of more than 800 million euro -lrb- $ 793 million -rrb- .
the figures , announced by new ceo gunter thielen , are encouraging even if they are more attributable to middelhoff than the new regime .
like middelhoff , thielen said bertelsmann was going to focus on the tradional media that brought the 167-year-old concern to where it is today .
the concern 's successful television wing , which includes germany 's rtl channel , will play a large role in trimming bertelsmann 's losses .
as part of the consolidation , bertelsmann is casting off money-losing online retailers for which middelhoff had great hopes .
the company said this week it is looking for buyers for bol.com , an online book retailer .
bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .
thielen is also restructuring the top level of bertelsmann management and decentralizing a firm that middelhoff labored to develop into an integrated corporation .
with the elimination of some positions , and the shifting of others , thielen has already cut 76 jobs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steadying the ship at bertelsmann thomas middelhoff ’ s successor at bertelsmann is a loyal company man who enjoys the type of trust from the influential mohn family middelhoff never did .

in doing so , the company is returning to its traditional roots . more than a month after letting go of freewheeling ceo thomas middelhoff , german media giant bertelsmann is well on its way through a substantial consolidation .
on tuesday , bertelsmann posted operating profits in the first half of 2002 of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- .
the figure was a vast improvement over the first half of 2001 , when bertelsmann posted losses of more than 800 million euro -lrb- $ 793 million -rrb- .
the figures , announced by new ceo gunter thielen , are encouraging even if they are more attributable to middelhoff than the new regime .
like middelhoff , thielen said bertelsmann was going to focus on the tradional media that brought the 167-year-old concern to where it is today .
the concern 's successful television wing , which includes germany 's rtl channel , will play a large role in trimming bertelsmann 's losses .
as part of the consolidation , bertelsmann is casting off money-losing online retailers for which middelhoff had great hopes .
the company said this week it is looking for buyers for bol.com , an online book retailer .
bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2002 making the internet visible for the blind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to information for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities . matthias klaus has been blind since birth .
but the internet has made it possible for him to work as a journalist with much greater ease .
that 's not always the case , however .
sometimes the special screen reader software installed on his computer conks out – a situation usually caused by web pages that lack basic text descriptions of images and icons , which are supposed to be a standard component of web coding .
" once i was on a site called " travel for the disabled , " klaus says .
" but it was programmed in a way that you could n't read it .
i even took the trouble to call them up and tell them about the problem , but they still have n't changed the site . "
and that irritates klaus , because surfing is all he wants to do .
the internet is supposed to make everyday life simpler for everyone , but when content providers take short cuts on their coding , it can keep blind users like klaus in the dark .
screen readers for the visually impaired for several years now , new software programs have made it easier for the blind to surf the internet .
a so-called screen reader reads the text of each web page using a synthesized computer voice .
sometimes the voice can sound a bit rattling , but the digital reading machines do make it possible for blind people to find their way onto the internet .
text descriptions embedded into the html code of a web page 's features also make it possible for the blind to recognize icons or graphics that would normally appear on screen .
in addition to screen readers , there are also software programs designed to make internet access easier for people with other disabilities .
some programs make it possible for people who ca n't , for example , use a mouse to instead work exclusively with a keyboard .
for older people with diminished or otherwise impaired vision , software is also available that renders web pages in large type .
making the web safe for the disabled yet despite such advances , there is still much work to be done .
" it would be nice if i were able to access my bank online so that i would n't have to have someone read my bank statements to me anymore , " klaus says .
" then i would n't have to feel as naked as i do now . "
but banks are n't the only companies whose web sites tend to be rendered unreadable by software designed for making the internet accessible to people with vision loss or other impairments .
due to the heavy use of set colors , forms and graphics , the special software is often unable to read pages .
" if a web designer is set on offering web content in a specific font or type size , then he 's going to have a problem creating barrier-free offerings , " says henrike gappa of the fraunhofer institute for applied information technologies in st. augustin .
scientists at the institute are working with companies and the government to help them create web pages that are n't plagued with access barriers .
in the past , many companies have avoided offering web pages designed for people with disabilities because they feared that doing so would incur additional development costs .
but that 's a prejudice researchers at the fraunhofer institute are eager to eliminate .
they say it is unnecessary to create special pages for people with disabilities .
it suffices to follow the basic rules of good web design and to create a single type of web page that is accessible to all .
it 's simple : images on web pages should always use html standard descriptor tags , and complicated elements should be avoided if no simpler alternative is made available simultaneously .
" we 're trying to train web designers , companies and government authorities on how they can create pages that are accessible using every type of internet software , " grappa says .
and though private companies ca n't be forced to do so , grappa notes , government agencies are required to make their pages accessible to the disabled . sönje storm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fraunhofer institute for applied information technology more information about the fraunhofer institute 's efforts in promoting a barrier-free internet .

the internet is supposed to make everyday life simpler for everyone , but when content providers take short cuts on their coding , it can keep blind users like klaus in the dark .
screen readers for the visually impaired for several years now , new software programs have made it easier for the blind to surf the internet .
a so-called screen reader reads the text of each web page using a synthesized computer voice .
sometimes the voice can sound a bit rattling , but the digital reading machines do make it possible for blind people to find their way onto the internet .
text descriptions embedded into the html code of a web page 's features also make it possible for the blind to recognize icons or graphics that would normally appear on screen .
in addition to screen readers , there are also software programs designed to make internet access easier for people with other disabilities .

in doing so , the company is returning to its traditional roots . more than a month after letting go of freewheeling ceo thomas middelhoff , german media giant bertelsmann is well on its way through a substantial consolidation .
on tuesday , bertelsmann posted operating profits in the first half of 2002 of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- .
the figure was a vast improvement over the first half of 2001 , when bertelsmann posted losses of more than 800 million euro -lrb- $ 793 million -rrb- .
the figures , announced by new ceo gunter thielen , are encouraging even if they are more attributable to middelhoff than the new regime .
like middelhoff , thielen said bertelsmann was going to focus on the tradional media that brought the 167-year-old concern to where it is today .
the concern 's successful television wing , which includes germany 's rtl channel , will play a large role in trimming bertelsmann 's losses .
as part of the consolidation , bertelsmann is casting off money-losing online retailers for which middelhoff had great hopes .
the company said this week it is looking for buyers for bol.com , an online book retailer .
bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .
thielen is also restructuring the top level of bertelsmann management and decentralizing a firm that middelhoff labored to develop into an integrated corporation .

in doing so , the company is returning to its traditional roots . more than a month after letting go of freewheeling ceo thomas middelhoff , german media giant bertelsmann is well on its way through a substantial consolidation .
on tuesday , bertelsmann posted operating profits in the first half of 2002 of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- .
the figure was a vast improvement over the first half of 2001 , when bertelsmann posted losses of more than 800 million euro -lrb- $ 793 million -rrb- .
the figures , announced by new ceo gunter thielen , are encouraging even if they are more attributable to middelhoff than the new regime .
like middelhoff , thielen said bertelsmann was going to focus on the tradional media that brought the 167-year-old concern to where it is today .
the concern 's successful television wing , which includes germany 's rtl channel , will play a large role in trimming bertelsmann 's losses .
as part of the consolidation , bertelsmann is casting off money-losing online retailers for which middelhoff had great hopes .
the company said this week it is looking for buyers for bol.com , an online book retailer .
bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .
thielen is also restructuring the top level of bertelsmann management and decentralizing a firm that middelhoff labored to develop into an integrated corporation .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .
" technologies do exist , " says singh .
but with an annual consumption of some 6,000 tonnes , the kind of investment necessary doesn ’ t justify the production volume .
" so , we need to work more on them , develop them further so that it becomes feasible to adopt these technologies and produce the small amount that we are producing for domestic consumption . "
the indian government is also a problem , she adds .
if they applied the same ecofrig zeal to cleaning up other areas - from air and water pollution to plastics and toxic waste - there would be fewer ecological danger signals .
as it is , awareness is disturbingly low , warns singh .
" the more pressing problems for india are poverty or development .
but global warming or ozone depletion , those are still more a problem of the western world , " she says .
" people are hardly aware of these issues here . "
integration can make a difference godrej , one of india 's top producers of air-conditioners , refrigerators and other appliances , is a central player in the ecofrig project .
nitin desai , godrej 's general manager for research and development , is all praise for ecofrig .
but he is not happy with the high costs , although the project covers 50 percent .
" everything is a huge investment , " says desai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrocarbon-based water coolers are a clean alternative to cfcs .
the manager is clearly impatient with the multilateral fund , which he says has been far less supportive than it should be .
sdc 's kessler acknowledges that the costs are high for developing countries .
" the multilateral fund policy is not contributing to any technological upgrading .
and whenever you make a change to new technology , you will also want to have good , up-to-date technology . "
but any project that helps make a difference is welcome , he adds .
ecofrig also claims to be different in that it focuses on establishing a level playing field and eventual self-sufficiency .
" it ’ s rather unique that a developing project has given so much power to the target group , " he says .
" it ’ s a project that really links from the top policy levels down to the micro level of an individual shopkeeper running a service shop .
so it 's very integrative . "
to help with the changeover to hydrocarbons , ecofrig has organized technical and hands-on training workshops .
with these steps , the project organizers are certain india will be able to phase out cfcs by 2010 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program www-links the ecofrig project further details on the gtz ecofrig project in india .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .
" technologies do exist , " says singh .
but with an annual consumption of some 6,000 tonnes , the kind of investment necessary doesn ’ t justify the production volume .
" so , we need to work more on them , develop them further so that it becomes feasible to adopt these technologies and produce the small amount that we are producing for domestic consumption . "
the indian government is also a problem , she adds .
if they applied the same ecofrig zeal to cleaning up other areas - from air and water pollution to plastics and toxic waste - there would be fewer ecological danger signals .
as it is , awareness is disturbingly low , warns singh .
" the more pressing problems for india are poverty or development .
but global warming or ozone depletion , those are still more a problem of the western world , " she says .
" people are hardly aware of these issues here . "
integration can make a difference godrej , one of india 's top producers of air-conditioners , refrigerators and other appliances , is a central player in the ecofrig project .

the big question now is whether the un summit on sustainable development taking place in johannesburg from august 26 to september 4 , 2002 will emulate the landmark rio conference that produced conventions on climate change and agenda 21 - a blueprint for sustainable development .
as far as logisitics are concerned , the johannesburg summit has already exceeded the first earth summit .
it ’ s being billed as the largest united nations gathering ever - with over 65,000 delegates , 5,000 journalists , over 200 non-governmental organisations and 106 heads of state .

-lrb- august 26 , 2002 -rrb- footing the development bill the proportion of gross national product that wealthy industrial nations spend on development has fallen over the past decades .
but there are other options to finance such assistance .
-lrb- august 27 , 2002 -rrb- battling for fairness on the second day of the johannesburg summit , it 's becoming clear that non-governmental organizations and developing countries are facing a tough opponent in industrialized nations , as our dw-radio correspondent reports -lrb- aug 27 , 2002 -rrb- johannesburg nets fisheries agreement in the first substantive agreement at the earth summit in johannesburg , delegates agreed on a plan to try and protect the world 's diminishing fish stocks .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .
" technologies do exist , " says singh .
but with an annual consumption of some 6,000 tonnes , the kind of investment necessary doesn ’ t justify the production volume .
" so , we need to work more on them , develop them further so that it becomes feasible to adopt these technologies and produce the small amount that we are producing for domestic consumption . "
the indian government is also a problem , she adds .
if they applied the same ecofrig zeal to cleaning up other areas - from air and water pollution to plastics and toxic waste - there would be fewer ecological danger signals .
as it is , awareness is disturbingly low , warns singh .
" the more pressing problems for india are poverty or development .
but global warming or ozone depletion , those are still more a problem of the western world , " she says .
" people are hardly aware of these issues here . "
integration can make a difference godrej , one of india 's top producers of air-conditioners , refrigerators and other appliances , is a central player in the ecofrig project .
nitin desai , godrej 's general manager for research and development , is all praise for ecofrig .
but he is not happy with the high costs , although the project covers 50 percent .
" everything is a huge investment , " says desai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrocarbon-based water coolers are a clean alternative to cfcs .
the manager is clearly impatient with the multilateral fund , which he says has been far less supportive than it should be .
sdc 's kessler acknowledges that the costs are high for developing countries .
" the multilateral fund policy is not contributing to any technological upgrading .
and whenever you make a change to new technology , you will also want to have good , up-to-date technology . "
but any project that helps make a difference is welcome , he adds .
ecofrig also claims to be different in that it focuses on establishing a level playing field and eventual self-sufficiency .
" it ’ s rather unique that a developing project has given so much power to the target group , " he says .
" it ’ s a project that really links from the top policy levels down to the micro level of an individual shopkeeper running a service shop .
so it 's very integrative . "
to help with the changeover to hydrocarbons , ecofrig has organized technical and hands-on training workshops .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .
" technologies do exist , " says singh .
but with an annual consumption of some 6,000 tonnes , the kind of investment necessary doesn ’ t justify the production volume .
" so , we need to work more on them , develop them further so that it becomes feasible to adopt these technologies and produce the small amount that we are producing for domestic consumption . "
the indian government is also a problem , she adds .
if they applied the same ecofrig zeal to cleaning up other areas - from air and water pollution to plastics and toxic waste - there would be fewer ecological danger signals .
as it is , awareness is disturbingly low , warns singh .
" the more pressing problems for india are poverty or development .
but global warming or ozone depletion , those are still more a problem of the western world , " she says .
" people are hardly aware of these issues here . "
integration can make a difference godrej , one of india 's top producers of air-conditioners , refrigerators and other appliances , is a central player in the ecofrig project .
nitin desai , godrej 's general manager for research and development , is all praise for ecofrig .
but he is not happy with the high costs , although the project covers 50 percent .
" everything is a huge investment , " says desai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrocarbon-based water coolers are a clean alternative to cfcs .
the manager is clearly impatient with the multilateral fund , which he says has been far less supportive than it should be .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .
" technologies do exist , " says singh .
but with an annual consumption of some 6,000 tonnes , the kind of investment necessary doesn ’ t justify the production volume .
" so , we need to work more on them , develop them further so that it becomes feasible to adopt these technologies and produce the small amount that we are producing for domestic consumption . "
the indian government is also a problem , she adds .
if they applied the same ecofrig zeal to cleaning up other areas - from air and water pollution to plastics and toxic waste - there would be fewer ecological danger signals .
as it is , awareness is disturbingly low , warns singh .
" the more pressing problems for india are poverty or development .
but global warming or ozone depletion , those are still more a problem of the western world , " she says .
" people are hardly aware of these issues here . "
integration can make a difference godrej , one of india 's top producers of air-conditioners , refrigerators and other appliances , is a central player in the ecofrig project .
nitin desai , godrej 's general manager for research and development , is all praise for ecofrig .
but he is not happy with the high costs , although the project covers 50 percent .
" everything is a huge investment , " says desai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrocarbon-based water coolers are a clean alternative to cfcs .
the manager is clearly impatient with the multilateral fund , which he says has been far less supportive than it should be .
sdc 's kessler acknowledges that the costs are high for developing countries .
" the multilateral fund policy is not contributing to any technological upgrading .
and whenever you make a change to new technology , you will also want to have good , up-to-date technology . "
but any project that helps make a difference is welcome , he adds .
ecofrig also claims to be different in that it focuses on establishing a level playing field and eventual self-sufficiency .
" it ’ s rather unique that a developing project has given so much power to the target group , " he says .
" it ’ s a project that really links from the top policy levels down to the micro level of an individual shopkeeper running a service shop .
so it 's very integrative . "
to help with the changeover to hydrocarbons , ecofrig has organized technical and hands-on training workshops .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .
" technologies do exist , " says singh .
but with an annual consumption of some 6,000 tonnes , the kind of investment necessary doesn ’ t justify the production volume .
" so , we need to work more on them , develop them further so that it becomes feasible to adopt these technologies and produce the small amount that we are producing for domestic consumption . "
the indian government is also a problem , she adds .
if they applied the same ecofrig zeal to cleaning up other areas - from air and water pollution to plastics and toxic waste - there would be fewer ecological danger signals .
as it is , awareness is disturbingly low , warns singh .
" the more pressing problems for india are poverty or development .
but global warming or ozone depletion , those are still more a problem of the western world , " she says .
" people are hardly aware of these issues here . "
integration can make a difference godrej , one of india 's top producers of air-conditioners , refrigerators and other appliances , is a central player in the ecofrig project .
nitin desai , godrej 's general manager for research and development , is all praise for ecofrig .
but he is not happy with the high costs , although the project covers 50 percent .
" everything is a huge investment , " says desai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrocarbon-based water coolers are a clean alternative to cfcs .
the manager is clearly impatient with the multilateral fund , which he says has been far less supportive than it should be .
sdc 's kessler acknowledges that the costs are high for developing countries .
" the multilateral fund policy is not contributing to any technological upgrading .
and whenever you make a change to new technology , you will also want to have good , up-to-date technology . "
but any project that helps make a difference is welcome , he adds .
ecofrig also claims to be different in that it focuses on establishing a level playing field and eventual self-sufficiency .
" it ’ s rather unique that a developing project has given so much power to the target group , " he says .
" it ’ s a project that really links from the top policy levels down to the micro level of an individual shopkeeper running a service shop .
so it 's very integrative . "
to help with the changeover to hydrocarbons , ecofrig has organized technical and hands-on training workshops .
with these steps , the project organizers are certain india will be able to phase out cfcs by 2010 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program www-links the ecofrig project further details on the gtz ecofrig project in india .

in doing so , the company is returning to its traditional roots . more than a month after letting go of freewheeling ceo thomas middelhoff , german media giant bertelsmann is well on its way through a substantial consolidation .
on tuesday , bertelsmann posted operating profits in the first half of 2002 of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- .
the figure was a vast improvement over the first half of 2001 , when bertelsmann posted losses of more than 800 million euro -lrb- $ 793 million -rrb- .
the figures , announced by new ceo gunter thielen , are encouraging even if they are more attributable to middelhoff than the new regime .
like middelhoff , thielen said bertelsmann was going to focus on the tradional media that brought the 167-year-old concern to where it is today .
the concern 's successful television wing , which includes germany 's rtl channel , will play a large role in trimming bertelsmann 's losses .
as part of the consolidation , bertelsmann is casting off money-losing online retailers for which middelhoff had great hopes .
the company said this week it is looking for buyers for bol.com , an online book retailer .
bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .

in doing so , the company is returning to its traditional roots . more than a month after letting go of freewheeling ceo thomas middelhoff , german media giant bertelsmann is well on its way through a substantial consolidation .
on tuesday , bertelsmann posted operating profits in the first half of 2002 of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- .
the figure was a vast improvement over the first half of 2001 , when bertelsmann posted losses of more than 800 million euro -lrb- $ 793 million -rrb- .
the figures , announced by new ceo gunter thielen , are encouraging even if they are more attributable to middelhoff than the new regime .
like middelhoff , thielen said bertelsmann was going to focus on the tradional media that brought the 167-year-old concern to where it is today .
the concern 's successful television wing , which includes germany 's rtl channel , will play a large role in trimming bertelsmann 's losses .
as part of the consolidation , bertelsmann is casting off money-losing online retailers for which middelhoff had great hopes .
the company said this week it is looking for buyers for bol.com , an online book retailer .
bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .

but a plan to expand renewable energies promoted by germany has been watered down . u.n. secretary general kofi annan and south african president thabo mbeki welcomed heads of states on monday , urging them to emerge from this earth summit with real commitments , targets and timetables to reduce poverty worldwide and protect the environment .
with most of the key issues like biodiversity , water and sanitation targets agreed to , negotiators overnight failed to solve remaining sticking points on energy and globalization despite summit president mbeki urging delegates to commit to real action .
schröder pledges one billion euro for clean energy german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- was one of the first of the 109 world leaders to speak and to offer solid action on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he referred to germany 's devastating floods as an example of the extreme weather conditions the world will face if more is n't done to address the issue of climate change .
the european union , which has ratified the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide , is pressuring russia and other countries to ratify the treaty so that it can come into force .
" these challenges force us to negotiate for our natural environment and the future of our children , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told the delegates .
" that 's why the conference should urge all states to ratify the kyoto protocol as soon as possible so that it can come into force this year .
and , in particular , the wealthy states and industrial countries of this world have a special responsibility for the ratification of this protocol . "
by tuesday , canada , china and russia said they would seek to ratify kyoto by the end of the year , which would give the treaty enough signatories to be enacted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one of the biggest concrete aid pledges to be unveiled so far at the johannesburg summit , schröder on monday announced a five-year , one billion euro plan to help developing nations expand their usage of renewable energies .
schröder : open markets to developing countries schröder also alluded to the contentious issue of agricultural subsidies , calling on all developed countries to reduce subsidies that prevent developing nations from accessing western markets .
his sentiments were echoed by british prime minister tony blair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this summit has to set a clear direction for the future for our world , " blair -lrb- photo -rrb- said . " we must open up our world trade and that must include the developed world opening up its markets to the products of the developing world , especially for agriculture . "
german development minister decries u.s. 's " dinosaur thinking " u.s. president george w. bush is one of the most high-profile absences at this year 's summit .
and american delegates have come to a head with the european union over the renewable energy targets that commit countries to a 15-percent increase in clean energy technologies like wind and solar power by 2010 .
the usa and other oil-producing nations managed to keep strict targets out of the final agreement .
germany had been the main proponent of the renewable energy initiative , and the failure to set a 15-percent goal dealt a setback to the delegation .
on tuesday , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul scoffed at the u.s. 's recalcitrance , criticizing the " frightful near-sightedness of the opec nations and the usa , which are attached to dinosaur thinking that is n't compatible with the future . "
german environmental activists also lamented the compromise .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , however , gave the summit 's progress so far mixed reviews , lauding the clean water breakthrough while at the same time criticizing the failure to find consensus in other key areas .
annan calls for courageous pledges # b # with only one day of negotiations left to go , and no major issues of contention left on the agenda , some commentators are already saying a failure at johannesburg will result in the end of global conferences on this scale .
as the u.n. 's biggest ever conference entered its final phase , secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- called on world leaders to show more courage in their decisions .
but some now fear johannesburg may even be a step backwards from the rio earth summit 10 years ago .
participating countries have , however , established a handful of concrete goals .
the united states agreed to join forces in the millennium statement of 2000 to cut by half the number of people in the world who do not have access to clean drinking water by 2015 .
as a handful of new countries signalled support for the kyoto protocol , german chancellor schröder appealed to the u.s. to do the same , saying americans should also " fulfill their responsibilities in the area of climate protection and make an equal contribution toward the reduction of greenhouse gases .

in doing so , the company is returning to its traditional roots . more than a month after letting go of freewheeling ceo thomas middelhoff , german media giant bertelsmann is well on its way through a substantial consolidation .
on tuesday , bertelsmann posted operating profits in the first half of 2002 of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- .
the figure was a vast improvement over the first half of 2001 , when bertelsmann posted losses of more than 800 million euro -lrb- $ 793 million -rrb- .
the figures , announced by new ceo gunter thielen , are encouraging even if they are more attributable to middelhoff than the new regime .
like middelhoff , thielen said bertelsmann was going to focus on the tradional media that brought the 167-year-old concern to where it is today .
the concern 's successful television wing , which includes germany 's rtl channel , will play a large role in trimming bertelsmann 's losses .
as part of the consolidation , bertelsmann is casting off money-losing online retailers for which middelhoff had great hopes .
the company said this week it is looking for buyers for bol.com , an online book retailer .
bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .
thielen is also restructuring the top level of bertelsmann management and decentralizing a firm that middelhoff labored to develop into an integrated corporation .
with the elimination of some positions , and the shifting of others , thielen has already cut 76 jobs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steadying the ship at bertelsmann thomas middelhoff ’ s successor at bertelsmann is a loyal company man who enjoys the type of trust from the influential mohn family middelhoff never did .

but a plan to expand renewable energies promoted by germany has been watered down . u.n. secretary general kofi annan and south african president thabo mbeki welcomed heads of states on monday , urging them to emerge from this earth summit with real commitments , targets and timetables to reduce poverty worldwide and protect the environment .
with most of the key issues like biodiversity , water and sanitation targets agreed to , negotiators overnight failed to solve remaining sticking points on energy and globalization despite summit president mbeki urging delegates to commit to real action .
schröder pledges one billion euro for clean energy german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- was one of the first of the 109 world leaders to speak and to offer solid action on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he referred to germany 's devastating floods as an example of the extreme weather conditions the world will face if more is n't done to address the issue of climate change .
the european union , which has ratified the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide , is pressuring russia and other countries to ratify the treaty so that it can come into force .
" these challenges force us to negotiate for our natural environment and the future of our children , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told the delegates .
" that 's why the conference should urge all states to ratify the kyoto protocol as soon as possible so that it can come into force this year .
and , in particular , the wealthy states and industrial countries of this world have a special responsibility for the ratification of this protocol . "
by tuesday , canada , china and russia said they would seek to ratify kyoto by the end of the year , which would give the treaty enough signatories to be enacted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one of the biggest concrete aid pledges to be unveiled so far at the johannesburg summit , schröder on monday announced a five-year , one billion euro plan to help developing nations expand their usage of renewable energies .
schröder : open markets to developing countries schröder also alluded to the contentious issue of agricultural subsidies , calling on all developed countries to reduce subsidies that prevent developing nations from accessing western markets .
his sentiments were echoed by british prime minister tony blair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this summit has to set a clear direction for the future for our world , " blair -lrb- photo -rrb- said . " we must open up our world trade and that must include the developed world opening up its markets to the products of the developing world , especially for agriculture . "
german development minister decries u.s. 's " dinosaur thinking " u.s. president george w. bush is one of the most high-profile absences at this year 's summit .
and american delegates have come to a head with the european union over the renewable energy targets that commit countries to a 15-percent increase in clean energy technologies like wind and solar power by 2010 .
the usa and other oil-producing nations managed to keep strict targets out of the final agreement .
germany had been the main proponent of the renewable energy initiative , and the failure to set a 15-percent goal dealt a setback to the delegation .
on tuesday , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul scoffed at the u.s. 's recalcitrance , criticizing the " frightful near-sightedness of the opec nations and the usa , which are attached to dinosaur thinking that is n't compatible with the future . "
german environmental activists also lamented the compromise .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , however , gave the summit 's progress so far mixed reviews , lauding the clean water breakthrough while at the same time criticizing the failure to find consensus in other key areas .
annan calls for courageous pledges # b # with only one day of negotiations left to go , and no major issues of contention left on the agenda , some commentators are already saying a failure at johannesburg will result in the end of global conferences on this scale .
as the u.n. 's biggest ever conference entered its final phase , secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- called on world leaders to show more courage in their decisions .
but some now fear johannesburg may even be a step backwards from the rio earth summit 10 years ago .
participating countries have , however , established a handful of concrete goals .
the united states agreed to join forces in the millennium statement of 2000 to cut by half the number of people in the world who do not have access to clean drinking water by 2015 .
as a handful of new countries signalled support for the kyoto protocol , german chancellor schröder appealed to the u.s. to do the same , saying americans should also " fulfill their responsibilities in the area of climate protection and make an equal contribution toward the reduction of greenhouse gases .

in doing so , the company is returning to its traditional roots . more than a month after letting go of freewheeling ceo thomas middelhoff , german media giant bertelsmann is well on its way through a substantial consolidation .
on tuesday , bertelsmann posted operating profits in the first half of 2002 of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- .
the figure was a vast improvement over the first half of 2001 , when bertelsmann posted losses of more than 800 million euro -lrb- $ 793 million -rrb- .
the figures , announced by new ceo gunter thielen , are encouraging even if they are more attributable to middelhoff than the new regime .
like middelhoff , thielen said bertelsmann was going to focus on the tradional media that brought the 167-year-old concern to where it is today .
the concern 's successful television wing , which includes germany 's rtl channel , will play a large role in trimming bertelsmann 's losses .
as part of the consolidation , bertelsmann is casting off money-losing online retailers for which middelhoff had great hopes .
the company said this week it is looking for buyers for bol.com , an online book retailer .
bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .
thielen is also restructuring the top level of bertelsmann management and decentralizing a firm that middelhoff labored to develop into an integrated corporation .

in doing so , the company is returning to its traditional roots . more than a month after letting go of freewheeling ceo thomas middelhoff , german media giant bertelsmann is well on its way through a substantial consolidation .
on tuesday , bertelsmann posted operating profits in the first half of 2002 of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- .
the figure was a vast improvement over the first half of 2001 , when bertelsmann posted losses of more than 800 million euro -lrb- $ 793 million -rrb- .
the figures , announced by new ceo gunter thielen , are encouraging even if they are more attributable to middelhoff than the new regime .
like middelhoff , thielen said bertelsmann was going to focus on the tradional media that brought the 167-year-old concern to where it is today .
the concern 's successful television wing , which includes germany 's rtl channel , will play a large role in trimming bertelsmann 's losses .
as part of the consolidation , bertelsmann is casting off money-losing online retailers for which middelhoff had great hopes .
the company said this week it is looking for buyers for bol.com , an online book retailer .
bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .
thielen is also restructuring the top level of bertelsmann management and decentralizing a firm that middelhoff labored to develop into an integrated corporation .
with the elimination of some positions , and the shifting of others , thielen has already cut 76 jobs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steadying the ship at bertelsmann thomas middelhoff ’ s successor at bertelsmann is a loyal company man who enjoys the type of trust from the influential mohn family middelhoff never did .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .
" technologies do exist , " says singh .
but with an annual consumption of some 6,000 tonnes , the kind of investment necessary doesn ’ t justify the production volume .
" so , we need to work more on them , develop them further so that it becomes feasible to adopt these technologies and produce the small amount that we are producing for domestic consumption . "
the indian government is also a problem , she adds .
if they applied the same ecofrig zeal to cleaning up other areas - from air and water pollution to plastics and toxic waste - there would be fewer ecological danger signals .
as it is , awareness is disturbingly low , warns singh .
" the more pressing problems for india are poverty or development .
but global warming or ozone depletion , those are still more a problem of the western world , " she says .
" people are hardly aware of these issues here . "
integration can make a difference godrej , one of india 's top producers of air-conditioners , refrigerators and other appliances , is a central player in the ecofrig project .
nitin desai , godrej 's general manager for research and development , is all praise for ecofrig .
but he is not happy with the high costs , although the project covers 50 percent .
" everything is a huge investment , " says desai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrocarbon-based water coolers are a clean alternative to cfcs .
the manager is clearly impatient with the multilateral fund , which he says has been far less supportive than it should be .
sdc 's kessler acknowledges that the costs are high for developing countries .
" the multilateral fund policy is not contributing to any technological upgrading .
and whenever you make a change to new technology , you will also want to have good , up-to-date technology . "
but any project that helps make a difference is welcome , he adds .
ecofrig also claims to be different in that it focuses on establishing a level playing field and eventual self-sufficiency .
" it ’ s rather unique that a developing project has given so much power to the target group , " he says .
" it ’ s a project that really links from the top policy levels down to the micro level of an individual shopkeeper running a service shop .
so it 's very integrative . "
to help with the changeover to hydrocarbons , ecofrig has organized technical and hands-on training workshops .
with these steps , the project organizers are certain india will be able to phase out cfcs by 2010 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de living planet dw-radio 's weekly environment program www-links the ecofrig project further details on the gtz ecofrig project in india .

ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .
" technologies do exist , " says singh .
but with an annual consumption of some 6,000 tonnes , the kind of investment necessary doesn ’ t justify the production volume .
" so , we need to work more on them , develop them further so that it becomes feasible to adopt these technologies and produce the small amount that we are producing for domestic consumption . "
the indian government is also a problem , she adds .
if they applied the same ecofrig zeal to cleaning up other areas - from air and water pollution to plastics and toxic waste - there would be fewer ecological danger signals .
as it is , awareness is disturbingly low , warns singh .
" the more pressing problems for india are poverty or development .
but global warming or ozone depletion , those are still more a problem of the western world , " she says .
" people are hardly aware of these issues here . "
integration can make a difference godrej , one of india 's top producers of air-conditioners , refrigerators and other appliances , is a central player in the ecofrig project .
nitin desai , godrej 's general manager for research and development , is all praise for ecofrig .
but he is not happy with the high costs , although the project covers 50 percent .
" everything is a huge investment , " says desai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrocarbon-based water coolers are a clean alternative to cfcs .
the manager is clearly impatient with the multilateral fund , which he says has been far less supportive than it should be .
sdc 's kessler acknowledges that the costs are high for developing countries .
" the multilateral fund policy is not contributing to any technological upgrading .
and whenever you make a change to new technology , you will also want to have good , up-to-date technology . "
but any project that helps make a difference is welcome , he adds .
ecofrig also claims to be different in that it focuses on establishing a level playing field and eventual self-sufficiency .
" it ’ s rather unique that a developing project has given so much power to the target group , " he says .
" it ’ s a project that really links from the top policy levels down to the micro level of an individual shopkeeper running a service shop .
so it 's very integrative . "
to help with the changeover to hydrocarbons , ecofrig has organized technical and hands-on training workshops .

the big question now is whether the un summit on sustainable development taking place in johannesburg from august 26 to september 4 , 2002 will emulate the landmark rio conference that produced conventions on climate change and agenda 21 - a blueprint for sustainable development .
as far as logisitics are concerned , the johannesburg summit has already exceeded the first earth summit .
it ’ s being billed as the largest united nations gathering ever - with over 65,000 delegates , 5,000 journalists , over 200 non-governmental organisations and 106 heads of state .
but it remains to be seen whether world leaders gathered in johannesburg will get past mere talking and come up with concrete proposals and solutions aimed at relieving poverty and healing the planet .
while matters ranging from global warming , renewable energies , agricultural subsidies , the gap between rich and the poor , development aid among others are thrashed out in johannesburg , we take a look at some of the dominant and lesser-known issues both at the summit and on the sidelines . dw-world.de german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit will the much-awaited earth summit in johannesburg yield results ?

-lrb- aug 24 , 02 -rrb- world summit opens with eu , us at odds the world summit on sustainable development begins on monday in johannesburg , south africa , amid a growing rift on the environment between europe and the us .
-lrb- aug 26 , 02 -rrb- cooking with the sun while delegates at the earth summit which kicks off on monday are looking at how sustainable development can be put into practice , germany ’ s development agency gtz is already doing this in over 2 000 projects worldwide .
-lrb- august 26 , 2002 -rrb- footing the development bill the proportion of gross national product that wealthy industrial nations spend on development has fallen over the past decades .
but there are other options to finance such assistance .
-lrb- august 27 , 2002 -rrb- battling for fairness on the second day of the johannesburg summit , it 's becoming clear that non-governmental organizations and developing countries are facing a tough opponent in industrialized nations , as our dw-radio correspondent reports -lrb- aug 27 , 2002 -rrb- johannesburg nets fisheries agreement in the first substantive agreement at the earth summit in johannesburg , delegates agreed on a plan to try and protect the world 's diminishing fish stocks .

but the internet has made it possible for him to work as a journalist with much greater ease .
that 's not always the case , however .
sometimes the special screen reader software installed on his computer conks out – a situation usually caused by web pages that lack basic text descriptions of images and icons , which are supposed to be a standard component of web coding .
" once i was on a site called " travel for the disabled , " klaus says .
" but it was programmed in a way that you could n't read it .
i even took the trouble to call them up and tell them about the problem , but they still have n't changed the site . "
and that irritates klaus , because surfing is all he wants to do .
the internet is supposed to make everyday life simpler for everyone , but when content providers take short cuts on their coding , it can keep blind users like klaus in the dark .
screen readers for the visually impaired for several years now , new software programs have made it easier for the blind to surf the internet .
a so-called screen reader reads the text of each web page using a synthesized computer voice .
sometimes the voice can sound a bit rattling , but the digital reading machines do make it possible for blind people to find their way onto the internet .
text descriptions embedded into the html code of a web page 's features also make it possible for the blind to recognize icons or graphics that would normally appear on screen .
in addition to screen readers , there are also software programs designed to make internet access easier for people with other disabilities .
some programs make it possible for people who ca n't , for example , use a mouse to instead work exclusively with a keyboard .
for older people with diminished or otherwise impaired vision , software is also available that renders web pages in large type .
making the web safe for the disabled yet despite such advances , there is still much work to be done .
" it would be nice if i were able to access my bank online so that i would n't have to have someone read my bank statements to me anymore , " klaus says .
" then i would n't have to feel as naked as i do now . "
but banks are n't the only companies whose web sites tend to be rendered unreadable by software designed for making the internet accessible to people with vision loss or other impairments .
due to the heavy use of set colors , forms and graphics , the special software is often unable to read pages .
" if a web designer is set on offering web content in a specific font or type size , then he 's going to have a problem creating barrier-free offerings , " says henrike gappa of the fraunhofer institute for applied information technologies in st. augustin .
scientists at the institute are working with companies and the government to help them create web pages that are n't plagued with access barriers .
in the past , many companies have avoided offering web pages designed for people with disabilities because they feared that doing so would incur additional development costs .
but that 's a prejudice researchers at the fraunhofer institute are eager to eliminate .
they say it is unnecessary to create special pages for people with disabilities .
it suffices to follow the basic rules of good web design and to create a single type of web page that is accessible to all .
it 's simple : images on web pages should always use html standard descriptor tags , and complicated elements should be avoided if no simpler alternative is made available simultaneously .
" we 're trying to train web designers , companies and government authorities on how they can create pages that are accessible using every type of internet software , " grappa says .

but the internet has made it possible for him to work as a journalist with much greater ease .
that 's not always the case , however .
sometimes the special screen reader software installed on his computer conks out – a situation usually caused by web pages that lack basic text descriptions of images and icons , which are supposed to be a standard component of web coding .
" once i was on a site called " travel for the disabled , " klaus says .
" but it was programmed in a way that you could n't read it .
i even took the trouble to call them up and tell them about the problem , but they still have n't changed the site . "
and that irritates klaus , because surfing is all he wants to do .
the internet is supposed to make everyday life simpler for everyone , but when content providers take short cuts on their coding , it can keep blind users like klaus in the dark .
screen readers for the visually impaired for several years now , new software programs have made it easier for the blind to surf the internet .
a so-called screen reader reads the text of each web page using a synthesized computer voice .
sometimes the voice can sound a bit rattling , but the digital reading machines do make it possible for blind people to find their way onto the internet .
text descriptions embedded into the html code of a web page 's features also make it possible for the blind to recognize icons or graphics that would normally appear on screen .
in addition to screen readers , there are also software programs designed to make internet access easier for people with other disabilities .
some programs make it possible for people who ca n't , for example , use a mouse to instead work exclusively with a keyboard .
for older people with diminished or otherwise impaired vision , software is also available that renders web pages in large type .
making the web safe for the disabled yet despite such advances , there is still much work to be done .
" it would be nice if i were able to access my bank online so that i would n't have to have someone read my bank statements to me anymore , " klaus says .
" then i would n't have to feel as naked as i do now . "
but banks are n't the only companies whose web sites tend to be rendered unreadable by software designed for making the internet accessible to people with vision loss or other impairments .
due to the heavy use of set colors , forms and graphics , the special software is often unable to read pages .
" if a web designer is set on offering web content in a specific font or type size , then he 's going to have a problem creating barrier-free offerings , " says henrike gappa of the fraunhofer institute for applied information technologies in st. augustin .
scientists at the institute are working with companies and the government to help them create web pages that are n't plagued with access barriers .
in the past , many companies have avoided offering web pages designed for people with disabilities because they feared that doing so would incur additional development costs .
but that 's a prejudice researchers at the fraunhofer institute are eager to eliminate .
they say it is unnecessary to create special pages for people with disabilities .
it suffices to follow the basic rules of good web design and to create a single type of web page that is accessible to all .
it 's simple : images on web pages should always use html standard descriptor tags , and complicated elements should be avoided if no simpler alternative is made available simultaneously .
" we 're trying to train web designers , companies and government authorities on how they can create pages that are accessible using every type of internet software , " grappa says .

but a plan to expand renewable energies promoted by germany has been watered down . u.n. secretary general kofi annan and south african president thabo mbeki welcomed heads of states on monday , urging them to emerge from this earth summit with real commitments , targets and timetables to reduce poverty worldwide and protect the environment .
with most of the key issues like biodiversity , water and sanitation targets agreed to , negotiators overnight failed to solve remaining sticking points on energy and globalization despite summit president mbeki urging delegates to commit to real action .
schröder pledges one billion euro for clean energy german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- was one of the first of the 109 world leaders to speak and to offer solid action on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he referred to germany 's devastating floods as an example of the extreme weather conditions the world will face if more is n't done to address the issue of climate change .
the european union , which has ratified the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide , is pressuring russia and other countries to ratify the treaty so that it can come into force .
" these challenges force us to negotiate for our natural environment and the future of our children , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told the delegates .
" that 's why the conference should urge all states to ratify the kyoto protocol as soon as possible so that it can come into force this year .
and , in particular , the wealthy states and industrial countries of this world have a special responsibility for the ratification of this protocol . "
by tuesday , canada , china and russia said they would seek to ratify kyoto by the end of the year , which would give the treaty enough signatories to be enacted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one of the biggest concrete aid pledges to be unveiled so far at the johannesburg summit , schröder on monday announced a five-year , one billion euro plan to help developing nations expand their usage of renewable energies .
schröder : open markets to developing countries schröder also alluded to the contentious issue of agricultural subsidies , calling on all developed countries to reduce subsidies that prevent developing nations from accessing western markets .
his sentiments were echoed by british prime minister tony blair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this summit has to set a clear direction for the future for our world , " blair -lrb- photo -rrb- said .

german development minister decries u.s. 's " dinosaur thinking " u.s. president george w. bush is one of the most high-profile absences at this year 's summit .
and american delegates have come to a head with the european union over the renewable energy targets that commit countries to a 15-percent increase in clean energy technologies like wind and solar power by 2010 .
the usa and other oil-producing nations managed to keep strict targets out of the final agreement .
germany had been the main proponent of the renewable energy initiative , and the failure to set a 15-percent goal dealt a setback to the delegation .
on tuesday , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul scoffed at the u.s. 's recalcitrance , criticizing the " frightful near-sightedness of the opec nations and the usa , which are attached to dinosaur thinking that is n't compatible with the future . "
german environmental activists also lamented the compromise .

the united states agreed to join forces in the millennium statement of 2000 to cut by half the number of people in the world who do not have access to clean drinking water by 2015 .

germany had been the main proponent of the renewable energy initiative , and the failure to set a 15-percent goal dealt a setback to the delegation .
on tuesday , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul scoffed at the u.s. 's recalcitrance , criticizing the " frightful near-sightedness of the opec nations and the usa , which are attached to dinosaur thinking that is n't compatible with the future . "
german environmental activists also lamented the compromise .

with most of the key issues like biodiversity , water and sanitation targets agreed to , negotiators overnight failed to solve remaining sticking points on energy and globalization despite summit president mbeki urging delegates to commit to real action .
schröder pledges one billion euro for clean energy german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- was one of the first of the 109 world leaders to speak and to offer solid action on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he referred to germany 's devastating floods as an example of the extreme weather conditions the world will face if more is n't done to address the issue of climate change .
the european union , which has ratified the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide , is pressuring russia and other countries to ratify the treaty so that it can come into force .
" these challenges force us to negotiate for our natural environment and the future of our children , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told the delegates .
" that 's why the conference should urge all states to ratify the kyoto protocol as soon as possible so that it can come into force this year .
and , in particular , the wealthy states and industrial countries of this world have a special responsibility for the ratification of this protocol . "
by tuesday , canada , china and russia said they would seek to ratify kyoto by the end of the year , which would give the treaty enough signatories to be enacted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one of the biggest concrete aid pledges to be unveiled so far at the johannesburg summit , schröder on monday announced a five-year , one billion euro plan to help developing nations expand their usage of renewable energies .
schröder : open markets to developing countries schröder also alluded to the contentious issue of agricultural subsidies , calling on all developed countries to reduce subsidies that prevent developing nations from accessing western markets .
his sentiments were echoed by british prime minister tony blair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this summit has to set a clear direction for the future for our world , " blair -lrb- photo -rrb- said . " we must open up our world trade and that must include the developed world opening up its markets to the products of the developing world , especially for agriculture . "
german development minister decries u.s. 's " dinosaur thinking " u.s. president george w. bush is one of the most high-profile absences at this year 's summit .
and american delegates have come to a head with the european union over the renewable energy targets that commit countries to a 15-percent increase in clean energy technologies like wind and solar power by 2010 .
the usa and other oil-producing nations managed to keep strict targets out of the final agreement .
germany had been the main proponent of the renewable energy initiative , and the failure to set a 15-percent goal dealt a setback to the delegation .
on tuesday , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul scoffed at the u.s. 's recalcitrance , criticizing the " frightful near-sightedness of the opec nations and the usa , which are attached to dinosaur thinking that is n't compatible with the future . "
german environmental activists also lamented the compromise .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , however , gave the summit 's progress so far mixed reviews , lauding the clean water breakthrough while at the same time criticizing the failure to find consensus in other key areas .
annan calls for courageous pledges # b # with only one day of negotiations left to go , and no major issues of contention left on the agenda , some commentators are already saying a failure at johannesburg will result in the end of global conferences on this scale .
as the u.n. 's biggest ever conference entered its final phase , secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- called on world leaders to show more courage in their decisions .
but some now fear johannesburg may even be a step backwards from the rio earth summit 10 years ago .
participating countries have , however , established a handful of concrete goals .
the united states agreed to join forces in the millennium statement of 2000 to cut by half the number of people in the world who do not have access to clean drinking water by 2015 .
as a handful of new countries signalled support for the kyoto protocol , german chancellor schröder appealed to the u.s. to do the same , saying americans should also " fulfill their responsibilities in the area of climate protection and make an equal contribution toward the reduction of greenhouse gases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2002 making the internet visible for the blind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to information for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities . matthias klaus has been blind since birth .
but the internet has made it possible for him to work as a journalist with much greater ease .
that 's not always the case , however .
sometimes the special screen reader software installed on his computer conks out – a situation usually caused by web pages that lack basic text descriptions of images and icons , which are supposed to be a standard component of web coding .
" once i was on a site called " travel for the disabled , " klaus says .
" but it was programmed in a way that you could n't read it .
i even took the trouble to call them up and tell them about the problem , but they still have n't changed the site . "
and that irritates klaus , because surfing is all he wants to do .
the internet is supposed to make everyday life simpler for everyone , but when content providers take short cuts on their coding , it can keep blind users like klaus in the dark .
screen readers for the visually impaired for several years now , new software programs have made it easier for the blind to surf the internet .
a so-called screen reader reads the text of each web page using a synthesized computer voice .
sometimes the voice can sound a bit rattling , but the digital reading machines do make it possible for blind people to find their way onto the internet .
text descriptions embedded into the html code of a web page 's features also make it possible for the blind to recognize icons or graphics that would normally appear on screen .
in addition to screen readers , there are also software programs designed to make internet access easier for people with other disabilities .
some programs make it possible for people who ca n't , for example , use a mouse to instead work exclusively with a keyboard .
for older people with diminished or otherwise impaired vision , software is also available that renders web pages in large type .
making the web safe for the disabled yet despite such advances , there is still much work to be done .
" it would be nice if i were able to access my bank online so that i would n't have to have someone read my bank statements to me anymore , " klaus says .
" then i would n't have to feel as naked as i do now . "
but banks are n't the only companies whose web sites tend to be rendered unreadable by software designed for making the internet accessible to people with vision loss or other impairments .
due to the heavy use of set colors , forms and graphics , the special software is often unable to read pages .
" if a web designer is set on offering web content in a specific font or type size , then he 's going to have a problem creating barrier-free offerings , " says henrike gappa of the fraunhofer institute for applied information technologies in st. augustin .
scientists at the institute are working with companies and the government to help them create web pages that are n't plagued with access barriers .
in the past , many companies have avoided offering web pages designed for people with disabilities because they feared that doing so would incur additional development costs .
but that 's a prejudice researchers at the fraunhofer institute are eager to eliminate .
they say it is unnecessary to create special pages for people with disabilities .
it suffices to follow the basic rules of good web design and to create a single type of web page that is accessible to all .
it 's simple : images on web pages should always use html standard descriptor tags , and complicated elements should be avoided if no simpler alternative is made available simultaneously .
" we 're trying to train web designers , companies and government authorities on how they can create pages that are accessible using every type of internet software , " grappa says .
and though private companies ca n't be forced to do so , grappa notes , government agencies are required to make their pages accessible to the disabled . sönje storm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fraunhofer institute for applied information technology more information about the fraunhofer institute 's efforts in promoting a barrier-free internet .

as far as logisitics are concerned , the johannesburg summit has already exceeded the first earth summit .
it ’ s being billed as the largest united nations gathering ever - with over 65,000 delegates , 5,000 journalists , over 200 non-governmental organisations and 106 heads of state .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .
" technologies do exist , " says singh .
but with an annual consumption of some 6,000 tonnes , the kind of investment necessary doesn ’ t justify the production volume .
" so , we need to work more on them , develop them further so that it becomes feasible to adopt these technologies and produce the small amount that we are producing for domestic consumption . "
the indian government is also a problem , she adds .
if they applied the same ecofrig zeal to cleaning up other areas - from air and water pollution to plastics and toxic waste - there would be fewer ecological danger signals .
as it is , awareness is disturbingly low , warns singh .
" the more pressing problems for india are poverty or development .
but global warming or ozone depletion , those are still more a problem of the western world , " she says .
" people are hardly aware of these issues here . "
integration can make a difference godrej , one of india 's top producers of air-conditioners , refrigerators and other appliances , is a central player in the ecofrig project .
nitin desai , godrej 's general manager for research and development , is all praise for ecofrig .
but he is not happy with the high costs , although the project covers 50 percent .
" everything is a huge investment , " says desai .

the manager is clearly impatient with the multilateral fund , which he says has been far less supportive than it should be .

" the multilateral fund policy is not contributing to any technological upgrading .
and whenever you make a change to new technology , you will also want to have good , up-to-date technology . "
but any project that helps make a difference is welcome , he adds .
ecofrig also claims to be different in that it focuses on establishing a level playing field and eventual self-sufficiency .
" it ’ s rather unique that a developing project has given so much power to the target group , " he says .
" it ’ s a project that really links from the top policy levels down to the micro level of an individual shopkeeper running a service shop .
so it 's very integrative . "
to help with the changeover to hydrocarbons , ecofrig has organized technical and hands-on training workshops .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .
" technologies do exist , " says singh .
but with an annual consumption of some 6,000 tonnes , the kind of investment necessary doesn ’ t justify the production volume .
" so , we need to work more on them , develop them further so that it becomes feasible to adopt these technologies and produce the small amount that we are producing for domestic consumption . "
the indian government is also a problem , she adds .
if they applied the same ecofrig zeal to cleaning up other areas - from air and water pollution to plastics and toxic waste - there would be fewer ecological danger signals .
as it is , awareness is disturbingly low , warns singh .
" the more pressing problems for india are poverty or development .
but global warming or ozone depletion , those are still more a problem of the western world , " she says .
" people are hardly aware of these issues here . "
integration can make a difference godrej , one of india 's top producers of air-conditioners , refrigerators and other appliances , is a central player in the ecofrig project .
nitin desai , godrej 's general manager for research and development , is all praise for ecofrig .
but he is not happy with the high costs , although the project covers 50 percent .
" everything is a huge investment , " says desai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrocarbon-based water coolers are a clean alternative to cfcs .
the manager is clearly impatient with the multilateral fund , which he says has been far less supportive than it should be .
sdc 's kessler acknowledges that the costs are high for developing countries .
" the multilateral fund policy is not contributing to any technological upgrading .
and whenever you make a change to new technology , you will also want to have good , up-to-date technology . "
but any project that helps make a difference is welcome , he adds .
ecofrig also claims to be different in that it focuses on establishing a level playing field and eventual self-sufficiency .

the big question now is whether the un summit on sustainable development taking place in johannesburg from august 26 to september 4 , 2002 will emulate the landmark rio conference that produced conventions on climate change and agenda 21 - a blueprint for sustainable development .
as far as logisitics are concerned , the johannesburg summit has already exceeded the first earth summit .
it ’ s being billed as the largest united nations gathering ever - with over 65,000 delegates , 5,000 journalists , over 200 non-governmental organisations and 106 heads of state .
but it remains to be seen whether world leaders gathered in johannesburg will get past mere talking and come up with concrete proposals and solutions aimed at relieving poverty and healing the planet .
while matters ranging from global warming , renewable energies , agricultural subsidies , the gap between rich and the poor , development aid among others are thrashed out in johannesburg , we take a look at some of the dominant and lesser-known issues both at the summit and on the sidelines . dw-world.de german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit will the much-awaited earth summit in johannesburg yield results ?

germany had been the main proponent of the renewable energy initiative , and the failure to set a 15-percent goal dealt a setback to the delegation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2002 making the internet visible for the blind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to information for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities . matthias klaus has been blind since birth .
but the internet has made it possible for him to work as a journalist with much greater ease .
that 's not always the case , however .
sometimes the special screen reader software installed on his computer conks out – a situation usually caused by web pages that lack basic text descriptions of images and icons , which are supposed to be a standard component of web coding .
" once i was on a site called " travel for the disabled , " klaus says .
" but it was programmed in a way that you could n't read it .
i even took the trouble to call them up and tell them about the problem , but they still have n't changed the site . "
and that irritates klaus , because surfing is all he wants to do .
the internet is supposed to make everyday life simpler for everyone , but when content providers take short cuts on their coding , it can keep blind users like klaus in the dark .
screen readers for the visually impaired for several years now , new software programs have made it easier for the blind to surf the internet .
a so-called screen reader reads the text of each web page using a synthesized computer voice .
sometimes the voice can sound a bit rattling , but the digital reading machines do make it possible for blind people to find their way onto the internet .
text descriptions embedded into the html code of a web page 's features also make it possible for the blind to recognize icons or graphics that would normally appear on screen .
in addition to screen readers , there are also software programs designed to make internet access easier for people with other disabilities .
some programs make it possible for people who ca n't , for example , use a mouse to instead work exclusively with a keyboard .
for older people with diminished or otherwise impaired vision , software is also available that renders web pages in large type .
making the web safe for the disabled yet despite such advances , there is still much work to be done .
" it would be nice if i were able to access my bank online so that i would n't have to have someone read my bank statements to me anymore , " klaus says .
" then i would n't have to feel as naked as i do now . "
but banks are n't the only companies whose web sites tend to be rendered unreadable by software designed for making the internet accessible to people with vision loss or other impairments .
due to the heavy use of set colors , forms and graphics , the special software is often unable to read pages .
" if a web designer is set on offering web content in a specific font or type size , then he 's going to have a problem creating barrier-free offerings , " says henrike gappa of the fraunhofer institute for applied information technologies in st. augustin .
scientists at the institute are working with companies and the government to help them create web pages that are n't plagued with access barriers .
in the past , many companies have avoided offering web pages designed for people with disabilities because they feared that doing so would incur additional development costs .
but that 's a prejudice researchers at the fraunhofer institute are eager to eliminate .
they say it is unnecessary to create special pages for people with disabilities .
it suffices to follow the basic rules of good web design and to create a single type of web page that is accessible to all .
it 's simple : images on web pages should always use html standard descriptor tags , and complicated elements should be avoided if no simpler alternative is made available simultaneously .
" we 're trying to train web designers , companies and government authorities on how they can create pages that are accessible using every type of internet software , " grappa says .
and though private companies ca n't be forced to do so , grappa notes , government agencies are required to make their pages accessible to the disabled . sönje storm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fraunhofer institute for applied information technology more information about the fraunhofer institute 's efforts in promoting a barrier-free internet . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

with most of the key issues like biodiversity , water and sanitation targets agreed to , negotiators overnight failed to solve remaining sticking points on energy and globalization despite summit president mbeki urging delegates to commit to real action .

" these challenges force us to negotiate for our natural environment and the future of our children , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told the delegates .
" that 's why the conference should urge all states to ratify the kyoto protocol as soon as possible so that it can come into force this year .
and , in particular , the wealthy states and industrial countries of this world have a special responsibility for the ratification of this protocol . "
by tuesday , canada , china and russia said they would seek to ratify kyoto by the end of the year , which would give the treaty enough signatories to be enacted .

the usa and other oil-producing nations managed to keep strict targets out of the final agreement .
germany had been the main proponent of the renewable energy initiative , and the failure to set a 15-percent goal dealt a setback to the delegation .
on tuesday , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul scoffed at the u.s. 's recalcitrance , criticizing the " frightful near-sightedness of the opec nations and the usa , which are attached to dinosaur thinking that is n't compatible with the future . "

" these challenges force us to negotiate for our natural environment and the future of our children , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told the delegates .
" that 's why the conference should urge all states to ratify the kyoto protocol as soon as possible so that it can come into force this year .
and , in particular , the wealthy states and industrial countries of this world have a special responsibility for the ratification of this protocol . "
by tuesday , canada , china and russia said they would seek to ratify kyoto by the end of the year , which would give the treaty enough signatories to be enacted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one of the biggest concrete aid pledges to be unveiled so far at the johannesburg summit , schröder on monday announced a five-year , one billion euro plan to help developing nations expand their usage of renewable energies .
schröder : open markets to developing countries schröder also alluded to the contentious issue of agricultural subsidies , calling on all developed countries to reduce subsidies that prevent developing nations from accessing western markets .
his sentiments were echoed by british prime minister tony blair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this summit has to set a clear direction for the future for our world , " blair -lrb- photo -rrb- said . " we must open up our world trade and that must include the developed world opening up its markets to the products of the developing world , especially for agriculture . "
german development minister decries u.s. 's " dinosaur thinking " u.s. president george w. bush is one of the most high-profile absences at this year 's summit .
and american delegates have come to a head with the european union over the renewable energy targets that commit countries to a 15-percent increase in clean energy technologies like wind and solar power by 2010 .
the usa and other oil-producing nations managed to keep strict targets out of the final agreement .
germany had been the main proponent of the renewable energy initiative , and the failure to set a 15-percent goal dealt a setback to the delegation .
on tuesday , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul scoffed at the u.s. 's recalcitrance , criticizing the " frightful near-sightedness of the opec nations and the usa , which are attached to dinosaur thinking that is n't compatible with the future . "
german environmental activists also lamented the compromise .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , however , gave the summit 's progress so far mixed reviews , lauding the clean water breakthrough while at the same time criticizing the failure to find consensus in other key areas .
annan calls for courageous pledges # b # with only one day of negotiations left to go , and no major issues of contention left on the agenda , some commentators are already saying a failure at johannesburg will result in the end of global conferences on this scale .
as the u.n. 's biggest ever conference entered its final phase , secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- called on world leaders to show more courage in their decisions .
but some now fear johannesburg may even be a step backwards from the rio earth summit 10 years ago .
participating countries have , however , established a handful of concrete goals .
the united states agreed to join forces in the millennium statement of 2000 to cut by half the number of people in the world who do not have access to clean drinking water by 2015 .
as a handful of new countries signalled support for the kyoto protocol , german chancellor schröder appealed to the u.s. to do the same , saying americans should also " fulfill their responsibilities in the area of climate protection and make an equal contribution toward the reduction of greenhouse gases .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .
" technologies do exist , " says singh .
but with an annual consumption of some 6,000 tonnes , the kind of investment necessary doesn ’ t justify the production volume .
" so , we need to work more on them , develop them further so that it becomes feasible to adopt these technologies and produce the small amount that we are producing for domestic consumption . "
the indian government is also a problem , she adds .
if they applied the same ecofrig zeal to cleaning up other areas - from air and water pollution to plastics and toxic waste - there would be fewer ecological danger signals .
as it is , awareness is disturbingly low , warns singh .
" the more pressing problems for india are poverty or development .
but global warming or ozone depletion , those are still more a problem of the western world , " she says .
" people are hardly aware of these issues here . "
integration can make a difference godrej , one of india 's top producers of air-conditioners , refrigerators and other appliances , is a central player in the ecofrig project .
nitin desai , godrej 's general manager for research and development , is all praise for ecofrig .
but he is not happy with the high costs , although the project covers 50 percent .
" everything is a huge investment , " says desai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrocarbon-based water coolers are a clean alternative to cfcs .
the manager is clearly impatient with the multilateral fund , which he says has been far less supportive than it should be .
sdc 's kessler acknowledges that the costs are high for developing countries .
" the multilateral fund policy is not contributing to any technological upgrading .
and whenever you make a change to new technology , you will also want to have good , up-to-date technology . "
but any project that helps make a difference is welcome , he adds .
ecofrig also claims to be different in that it focuses on establishing a level playing field and eventual self-sufficiency .
" it ’ s rather unique that a developing project has given so much power to the target group , " he says .
" it ’ s a project that really links from the top policy levels down to the micro level of an individual shopkeeper running a service shop .
so it 's very integrative . "
to help with the changeover to hydrocarbons , ecofrig has organized technical and hands-on training workshops .

refrigeration and air conditioning consume the largest amount of ozone-depleting substances in india .
but , with the help of international aid , the country is attempting to phase out the harmful chemicals responsible . india is still small fry compared to the world 's biggest sinners in terms of global warming .
but among developing countries , it comes second to china in contributing to depleting the planet 's ozone layer .
ozone destruction is caused mainly by chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs .
these are mostly used as refrigerants , solvents and aerosol repellents .
once in the atmosphere , cfcs , which are also extremely effective greenhouse gases , linger for many years .
following the discovery of the damage caused to the ozone layer , developed countries phased out the use of these chemicals almost completely in 1996 .
under the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer , developing countries are due to follow suit by 2010 .
in the case of india , the german and swiss development agencies have provided technical and financial support to help the country meet this deadline .
they are supplementing money from a special fund of the montreal protocol .
ecofrig : an alternative solution one such project aimed at helping india achieve this goal is ecofrig .
it started as an indo-swiss initiative in 1992 .
germany ’ s society for technical co-operation , the gtz , joined in the following year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charging of water coolers with hydrocarbon refrigerant .
the project supports technology transfer for replacing cfcs with the more ozone-friendly hydrocarbon refrigerants .
these are a better alternative to hydrochloro-fluorocarbons , or hfcs , the first major replacement for cfcs .
according to stefan kessler , a consultant with the swiss agency for development and co-operation sdc , hydrocarbons do not contribute to global warming .
various hfcs have this potential , though , and are thus just a transitional substance .
" therefore , the ecofrig project was lobbying in favor of the hydrocarbons , because this is the only really environmentally-friendly technology in a long-term perspective , " kessler told dw-radio ’ s sputnik kilambi .
an important consideration , adds kessler , was to provide appropriate research to make hydrocarbon technology a viable option in india .
" in europe , nobody really services an appliance if it fails .
if it ’ s more than three years old , you just replace it , " he says .
but in india , it will have to run for another 20 years .
" so , the after-sales market has a totally different priority than in europe .
what is done here is developing solutions that are applicable and best suitable for india . "
critical voices there are dissenting voices , though .
neelam singh , researcher with the delhi-based center for science and environment , says more research needs to be done on hydrocarbons themselves .
more importantly , she feels , not enough has been done to look for alternatives .
" technologies do exist , " says singh .
but with an annual consumption of some 6,000 tonnes , the kind of investment necessary doesn ’ t justify the production volume .
" so , we need to work more on them , develop them further so that it becomes feasible to adopt these technologies and produce the small amount that we are producing for domestic consumption . "
the indian government is also a problem , she adds .
if they applied the same ecofrig zeal to cleaning up other areas - from air and water pollution to plastics and toxic waste - there would be fewer ecological danger signals .
as it is , awareness is disturbingly low , warns singh .
" the more pressing problems for india are poverty or development .
but global warming or ozone depletion , those are still more a problem of the western world , " she says .
" people are hardly aware of these issues here . "
integration can make a difference godrej , one of india 's top producers of air-conditioners , refrigerators and other appliances , is a central player in the ecofrig project .
nitin desai , godrej 's general manager for research and development , is all praise for ecofrig .
but he is not happy with the high costs , although the project covers 50 percent .
" everything is a huge investment , " says desai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hydrocarbon-based water coolers are a clean alternative to cfcs .
the manager is clearly impatient with the multilateral fund , which he says has been far less supportive than it should be .
sdc 's kessler acknowledges that the costs are high for developing countries .
" the multilateral fund policy is not contributing to any technological upgrading .
and whenever you make a change to new technology , you will also want to have good , up-to-date technology . "
but any project that helps make a difference is welcome , he adds .
ecofrig also claims to be different in that it focuses on establishing a level playing field and eventual self-sufficiency .
" it ’ s rather unique that a developing project has given so much power to the target group , " he says .
" it ’ s a project that really links from the top policy levels down to the micro level of an individual shopkeeper running a service shop .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2002 making the internet visible for the blind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to information for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities . matthias klaus has been blind since birth .
but the internet has made it possible for him to work as a journalist with much greater ease .
that 's not always the case , however .
sometimes the special screen reader software installed on his computer conks out – a situation usually caused by web pages that lack basic text descriptions of images and icons , which are supposed to be a standard component of web coding .
" once i was on a site called " travel for the disabled , " klaus says .
" but it was programmed in a way that you could n't read it .
i even took the trouble to call them up and tell them about the problem , but they still have n't changed the site . "
and that irritates klaus , because surfing is all he wants to do .
the internet is supposed to make everyday life simpler for everyone , but when content providers take short cuts on their coding , it can keep blind users like klaus in the dark .
screen readers for the visually impaired for several years now , new software programs have made it easier for the blind to surf the internet .
a so-called screen reader reads the text of each web page using a synthesized computer voice .
sometimes the voice can sound a bit rattling , but the digital reading machines do make it possible for blind people to find their way onto the internet .
text descriptions embedded into the html code of a web page 's features also make it possible for the blind to recognize icons or graphics that would normally appear on screen .
in addition to screen readers , there are also software programs designed to make internet access easier for people with other disabilities .
some programs make it possible for people who ca n't , for example , use a mouse to instead work exclusively with a keyboard .
for older people with diminished or otherwise impaired vision , software is also available that renders web pages in large type .
making the web safe for the disabled yet despite such advances , there is still much work to be done .
" it would be nice if i were able to access my bank online so that i would n't have to have someone read my bank statements to me anymore , " klaus says .
" then i would n't have to feel as naked as i do now . "
but banks are n't the only companies whose web sites tend to be rendered unreadable by software designed for making the internet accessible to people with vision loss or other impairments .
due to the heavy use of set colors , forms and graphics , the special software is often unable to read pages .
" if a web designer is set on offering web content in a specific font or type size , then he 's going to have a problem creating barrier-free offerings , " says henrike gappa of the fraunhofer institute for applied information technologies in st. augustin .
scientists at the institute are working with companies and the government to help them create web pages that are n't plagued with access barriers .
in the past , many companies have avoided offering web pages designed for people with disabilities because they feared that doing so would incur additional development costs .
but that 's a prejudice researchers at the fraunhofer institute are eager to eliminate .
they say it is unnecessary to create special pages for people with disabilities .
it suffices to follow the basic rules of good web design and to create a single type of web page that is accessible to all .
it 's simple : images on web pages should always use html standard descriptor tags , and complicated elements should be avoided if no simpler alternative is made available simultaneously .
" we 're trying to train web designers , companies and government authorities on how they can create pages that are accessible using every type of internet software , " grappa says .
and though private companies ca n't be forced to do so , grappa notes , government agencies are required to make their pages accessible to the disabled . sönje storm send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fraunhofer institute for applied information technology more information about the fraunhofer institute 's efforts in promoting a barrier-free internet .

but a plan to expand renewable energies promoted by germany has been watered down . u.n. secretary general kofi annan and south african president thabo mbeki welcomed heads of states on monday , urging them to emerge from this earth summit with real commitments , targets and timetables to reduce poverty worldwide and protect the environment .
with most of the key issues like biodiversity , water and sanitation targets agreed to , negotiators overnight failed to solve remaining sticking points on energy and globalization despite summit president mbeki urging delegates to commit to real action .
schröder pledges one billion euro for clean energy german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- was one of the first of the 109 world leaders to speak and to offer solid action on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he referred to germany 's devastating floods as an example of the extreme weather conditions the world will face if more is n't done to address the issue of climate change .
the european union , which has ratified the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide , is pressuring russia and other countries to ratify the treaty so that it can come into force .
" these challenges force us to negotiate for our natural environment and the future of our children , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told the delegates .
" that 's why the conference should urge all states to ratify the kyoto protocol as soon as possible so that it can come into force this year .
and , in particular , the wealthy states and industrial countries of this world have a special responsibility for the ratification of this protocol . "
by tuesday , canada , china and russia said they would seek to ratify kyoto by the end of the year , which would give the treaty enough signatories to be enacted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one of the biggest concrete aid pledges to be unveiled so far at the johannesburg summit , schröder on monday announced a five-year , one billion euro plan to help developing nations expand their usage of renewable energies .
schröder : open markets to developing countries schröder also alluded to the contentious issue of agricultural subsidies , calling on all developed countries to reduce subsidies that prevent developing nations from accessing western markets .
his sentiments were echoed by british prime minister tony blair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this summit has to set a clear direction for the future for our world , " blair -lrb- photo -rrb- said . " we must open up our world trade and that must include the developed world opening up its markets to the products of the developing world , especially for agriculture . "
german development minister decries u.s. 's " dinosaur thinking " u.s. president george w. bush is one of the most high-profile absences at this year 's summit .
and american delegates have come to a head with the european union over the renewable energy targets that commit countries to a 15-percent increase in clean energy technologies like wind and solar power by 2010 .
the usa and other oil-producing nations managed to keep strict targets out of the final agreement .
germany had been the main proponent of the renewable energy initiative , and the failure to set a 15-percent goal dealt a setback to the delegation .
on tuesday , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul scoffed at the u.s. 's recalcitrance , criticizing the " frightful near-sightedness of the opec nations and the usa , which are attached to dinosaur thinking that is n't compatible with the future . "
german environmental activists also lamented the compromise .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , however , gave the summit 's progress so far mixed reviews , lauding the clean water breakthrough while at the same time criticizing the failure to find consensus in other key areas .
annan calls for courageous pledges # b # with only one day of negotiations left to go , and no major issues of contention left on the agenda , some commentators are already saying a failure at johannesburg will result in the end of global conferences on this scale .
as the u.n. 's biggest ever conference entered its final phase , secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- called on world leaders to show more courage in their decisions .
but some now fear johannesburg may even be a step backwards from the rio earth summit 10 years ago .
participating countries have , however , established a handful of concrete goals .
the united states agreed to join forces in the millennium statement of 2000 to cut by half the number of people in the world who do not have access to clean drinking water by 2015 .
as a handful of new countries signalled support for the kyoto protocol , german chancellor schröder appealed to the u.s. to do the same , saying americans should also " fulfill their responsibilities in the area of climate protection and make an equal contribution toward the reduction of greenhouse gases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2002 making the internet visible for the blind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to information for the blind researchers at germany 's fraunhofer institute are providing companies and government agencies with fast and free tips to make their web pages more accessible to those who are blind or live with other disabilities . matthias klaus has been blind since birth .
but the internet has made it possible for him to work as a journalist with much greater ease .
that 's not always the case , however .
sometimes the special screen reader software installed on his computer conks out – a situation usually caused by web pages that lack basic text descriptions of images and icons , which are supposed to be a standard component of web coding .
" once i was on a site called " travel for the disabled , " klaus says .
" but it was programmed in a way that you could n't read it .
i even took the trouble to call them up and tell them about the problem , but they still have n't changed the site . "
and that irritates klaus , because surfing is all he wants to do .
the internet is supposed to make everyday life simpler for everyone , but when content providers take short cuts on their coding , it can keep blind users like klaus in the dark .
screen readers for the visually impaired for several years now , new software programs have made it easier for the blind to surf the internet .
a so-called screen reader reads the text of each web page using a synthesized computer voice .
sometimes the voice can sound a bit rattling , but the digital reading machines do make it possible for blind people to find their way onto the internet .
text descriptions embedded into the html code of a web page 's features also make it possible for the blind to recognize icons or graphics that would normally appear on screen .
in addition to screen readers , there are also software programs designed to make internet access easier for people with other disabilities .
some programs make it possible for people who ca n't , for example , use a mouse to instead work exclusively with a keyboard .
for older people with diminished or otherwise impaired vision , software is also available that renders web pages in large type .
making the web safe for the disabled yet despite such advances , there is still much work to be done .
" it would be nice if i were able to access my bank online so that i would n't have to have someone read my bank statements to me anymore , " klaus says .
" then i would n't have to feel as naked as i do now . "
but banks are n't the only companies whose web sites tend to be rendered unreadable by software designed for making the internet accessible to people with vision loss or other impairments .
due to the heavy use of set colors , forms and graphics , the special software is often unable to read pages .
" if a web designer is set on offering web content in a specific font or type size , then he 's going to have a problem creating barrier-free offerings , " says henrike gappa of the fraunhofer institute for applied information technologies in st. augustin .
scientists at the institute are working with companies and the government to help them create web pages that are n't plagued with access barriers .
in the past , many companies have avoided offering web pages designed for people with disabilities because they feared that doing so would incur additional development costs .
but that 's a prejudice researchers at the fraunhofer institute are eager to eliminate .
they say it is unnecessary to create special pages for people with disabilities .
it suffices to follow the basic rules of good web design and to create a single type of web page that is accessible to all .
it 's simple : images on web pages should always use html standard descriptor tags , and complicated elements should be avoided if no simpler alternative is made available simultaneously .
" we 're trying to train web designers , companies and government authorities on how they can create pages that are accessible using every type of internet software , " grappa says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : environment matters german minister keeps his faith in upcoming earth summit on the green road from rio to johannesburg steering environmental issues back on the political agenda world summit opens with eu , us at odds europe -pipe- 04.09.2002 one step forward , two steps back at johannesburg summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the johannesburg summit draws to a close , leaders have reached a major deal on clean water .
but a plan to expand renewable energies promoted by germany has been watered down . u.n. secretary general kofi annan and south african president thabo mbeki welcomed heads of states on monday , urging them to emerge from this earth summit with real commitments , targets and timetables to reduce poverty worldwide and protect the environment .
with most of the key issues like biodiversity , water and sanitation targets agreed to , negotiators overnight failed to solve remaining sticking points on energy and globalization despite summit president mbeki urging delegates to commit to real action .
schröder pledges one billion euro for clean energy german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- was one of the first of the 109 world leaders to speak and to offer solid action on monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he referred to germany 's devastating floods as an example of the extreme weather conditions the world will face if more is n't done to address the issue of climate change .
the european union , which has ratified the kyoto protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions worldwide , is pressuring russia and other countries to ratify the treaty so that it can come into force .
" these challenges force us to negotiate for our natural environment and the future of our children , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told the delegates .
" that 's why the conference should urge all states to ratify the kyoto protocol as soon as possible so that it can come into force this year .
and , in particular , the wealthy states and industrial countries of this world have a special responsibility for the ratification of this protocol . "
by tuesday , canada , china and russia said they would seek to ratify kyoto by the end of the year , which would give the treaty enough signatories to be enacted .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in one of the biggest concrete aid pledges to be unveiled so far at the johannesburg summit , schröder on monday announced a five-year , one billion euro plan to help developing nations expand their usage of renewable energies .
schröder : open markets to developing countries schröder also alluded to the contentious issue of agricultural subsidies , calling on all developed countries to reduce subsidies that prevent developing nations from accessing western markets .
his sentiments were echoed by british prime minister tony blair .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this summit has to set a clear direction for the future for our world , " blair -lrb- photo -rrb- said . " we must open up our world trade and that must include the developed world opening up its markets to the products of the developing world , especially for agriculture . "
german development minister decries u.s. 's " dinosaur thinking " u.s. president george w. bush is one of the most high-profile absences at this year 's summit .
and american delegates have come to a head with the european union over the renewable energy targets that commit countries to a 15-percent increase in clean energy technologies like wind and solar power by 2010 .
the usa and other oil-producing nations managed to keep strict targets out of the final agreement .
germany had been the main proponent of the renewable energy initiative , and the failure to set a 15-percent goal dealt a setback to the delegation .
on tuesday , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul scoffed at the u.s. 's recalcitrance , criticizing the " frightful near-sightedness of the opec nations and the usa , which are attached to dinosaur thinking that is n't compatible with the future . "
german environmental activists also lamented the compromise .
german environment minister jürgen trittin , however , gave the summit 's progress so far mixed reviews , lauding the clean water breakthrough while at the same time criticizing the failure to find consensus in other key areas .
annan calls for courageous pledges # b # with only one day of negotiations left to go , and no major issues of contention left on the agenda , some commentators are already saying a failure at johannesburg will result in the end of global conferences on this scale .
as the u.n. 's biggest ever conference entered its final phase , secretary-general kofi annan -lrb- photo -rrb- called on world leaders to show more courage in their decisions .
but some now fear johannesburg may even be a step backwards from the rio earth summit 10 years ago .
participating countries have , however , established a handful of concrete goals .
the united states agreed to join forces in the millennium statement of 2000 to cut by half the number of people in the world who do not have access to clean drinking water by 2015 .
as a handful of new countries signalled support for the kyoto protocol , german chancellor schröder appealed to the u.s. to do the same , saying americans should also " fulfill their responsibilities in the area of climate protection and make an equal contribution toward the reduction of greenhouse gases .

but the internet has made it possible for him to work as a journalist with much greater ease .
that 's not always the case , however .
sometimes the special screen reader software installed on his computer conks out – a situation usually caused by web pages that lack basic text descriptions of images and icons , which are supposed to be a standard component of web coding .
" once i was on a site called " travel for the disabled , " klaus says .
" but it was programmed in a way that you could n't read it .
i even took the trouble to call them up and tell them about the problem , but they still have n't changed the site . "
and that irritates klaus , because surfing is all he wants to do .
the internet is supposed to make everyday life simpler for everyone , but when content providers take short cuts on their coding , it can keep blind users like klaus in the dark .
screen readers for the visually impaired for several years now , new software programs have made it easier for the blind to surf the internet .
a so-called screen reader reads the text of each web page using a synthesized computer voice .
sometimes the voice can sound a bit rattling , but the digital reading machines do make it possible for blind people to find their way onto the internet .
text descriptions embedded into the html code of a web page 's features also make it possible for the blind to recognize icons or graphics that would normally appear on screen .
in addition to screen readers , there are also software programs designed to make internet access easier for people with other disabilities .
some programs make it possible for people who ca n't , for example , use a mouse to instead work exclusively with a keyboard .
for older people with diminished or otherwise impaired vision , software is also available that renders web pages in large type .
making the web safe for the disabled yet despite such advances , there is still much work to be done .
" it would be nice if i were able to access my bank online so that i would n't have to have someone read my bank statements to me anymore , " klaus says .
" then i would n't have to feel as naked as i do now . "
but banks are n't the only companies whose web sites tend to be rendered unreadable by software designed for making the internet accessible to people with vision loss or other impairments .
due to the heavy use of set colors , forms and graphics , the special software is often unable to read pages .
" if a web designer is set on offering web content in a specific font or type size , then he 's going to have a problem creating barrier-free offerings , " says henrike gappa of the fraunhofer institute for applied information technologies in st. augustin .
scientists at the institute are working with companies and the government to help them create web pages that are n't plagued with access barriers .
in the past , many companies have avoided offering web pages designed for people with disabilities because they feared that doing so would incur additional development costs .
but that 's a prejudice researchers at the fraunhofer institute are eager to eliminate .
they say it is unnecessary to create special pages for people with disabilities .
it suffices to follow the basic rules of good web design and to create a single type of web page that is accessible to all .
it 's simple : images on web pages should always use html standard descriptor tags , and complicated elements should be avoided if no simpler alternative is made available simultaneously .
" we 're trying to train web designers , companies and government authorities on how they can create pages that are accessible using every type of internet software , " grappa says .

in doing so , the company is returning to its traditional roots . more than a month after letting go of freewheeling ceo thomas middelhoff , german media giant bertelsmann is well on its way through a substantial consolidation .
on tuesday , bertelsmann posted operating profits in the first half of 2002 of 157 million euro -lrb- $ 156 million -rrb- .
the figure was a vast improvement over the first half of 2001 , when bertelsmann posted losses of more than 800 million euro -lrb- $ 793 million -rrb- .
the figures , announced by new ceo gunter thielen , are encouraging even if they are more attributable to middelhoff than the new regime .
like middelhoff , thielen said bertelsmann was going to focus on the tradional media that brought the 167-year-old concern to where it is today .
the concern 's successful television wing , which includes germany 's rtl channel , will play a large role in trimming bertelsmann 's losses .
as part of the consolidation , bertelsmann is casting off money-losing online retailers for which middelhoff had great hopes .
the company said this week it is looking for buyers for bol.com , an online book retailer .
bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .
thielen is also restructuring the top level of bertelsmann management and decentralizing a firm that middelhoff labored to develop into an integrated corporation .

bol.com is part of the directgroup wing of bertelsmann , which lost 119 million euro in the first half of 2002 .
the concern is also likely to get rid of napster.com , the internet music trading site in which it has invested 100 million euro -lrb- $ 99 million -rrb- .
but thielen was quick to say the sales did not mean bertelsmann was getting out of the internet business altogether .
" we do n't see the internet as a separate business , but as a part of our core business , " he said at a press conference .
thielen is also restructuring the top level of bertelsmann management and decentralizing a firm that middelhoff labored to develop into an integrated corporation .
with the elimination of some positions , and the shifting of others , thielen has already cut 76 jobs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steadying the ship at bertelsmann thomas middelhoff ’ s successor at bertelsmann is a loyal company man who enjoys the type of trust from the influential mohn family middelhoff never did .

the poll of more than 9,000 people found 60 % of europeans and 65 % of americans in favour of action .
poll conducted in the us and six european countries 6,001 europeans and 3,262 americans interviewed conducted in june the survey - commissioned by the german marshall fund of the united states and the chicago council of foreign relations - also found that most europeans believed that american foreign policy was partly responsible for the attacks of 11 september .
but most europeans considered american military action since the attacks to be self-defence , rather than an attempt to enforce its will around the world .
support for washington researchers interviewed people in britain , france , germany , italy , the netherlands and poland , as well as the us .
europeans polled us partly had itself to blame for 11 september : 55 % agree us launched the war on terror in self-defence : 59 % agree approve of military strike on iraq if it has un backing : 60 % among those polled in europe , 55 % said they believed us foreign policy contributed to the attacks on new york and washington on 11 september last year .
the french were the most critical towards the us , with 63 % saying it was partly to blame while in italy , where the figure was lowest , a majority of 51 % still thought that way .
the poll 's sponsors say the survey shows that despite their differences , there is more that unites europeans and americans than divides them .
a majority - 59 % - of europeans saw american actions overseas in the past year , including the use of military force against the taleban and al-qaeda in afghanistan , as having been motivated by self-defence .
asked whether the european union should become a military and economic superpower like america , 65 % of europeans said yes .
but an overwhelming 90 % also said the eu should co-operate with america , not compete with it .

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -lrb- copd -rrb- , covers conditions including chronic bronchitis and emphysema .
in copd , the lungs become increasingly obstructed over time , making breathing more and more difficult .
it affects over one in 100 people in the uk , and there are up to 27,000 deaths from copd each year .
janice matthews : ' copd is a very disabling illness ' it is caused by many factors , but mainly by smoking , copd is called the " hidden killer " because two-thirds of the population have never heard of it .
convenience the new treatment , tiotropium -lrb- spiriva -rrb- , was launched by drug companies boehringer ingelheim and pfizer .
it works by counteracting the constriction of the muscles of the lung passages .
by dilating the airways , the passage of air in and out of the lungs is improved , making breathing easier .
doctors say the drug , which is taken via an inhaler , is easier and more convenient for copd patients .
dr michael rudolf : says drugs specifically designed for copd are needed dr michael rudolf , consultant respiratory physician at ealing hospital , london , and head of the british thoracic society 's copd committee , said : " unlike the other drugs , this has the advantage of only having to be taken once a day .
" and it is easy to use , even in people with particularly poor lung function . "
he added : " one of the major problems with drug treatments has been that nearly all the drugs we 've used were developed for asthma .
" what we badly need are drugs designed specifically for copd based on the increasing knowledge that we now have of the underlying abnormalities of the lungs that produce the problems for copd patients . "
' a better chance ' professor peter calverley , consultant respiratory physician at aintree hospitals liverpool , added : " until recently , copd has been regarded as a ' therapeutic wasteland ' by many doctors who think little can be achieved for these patients .
" results in clinical studies show that there are effective drugs for copd .
" better recognition of the clinical features of copd will also allow earlier intervention in this condition , giving sufferers the chance to maintain better health . "
janice matthews from warrington , who suffers from copd , said : " it 's a very disabling illness .
you feel so breathless all the time .
the slightest thing is such a major operation to do . "
a spokesperson for the british lung foundation told bbc news online : " we always welcome new developments in copd treatments and medication , and are following with keen interest the progress of spiriva . "

speaking shortly before arriving in johannesburg for the world summit , mr powell also hinted that the president is close to making a public declaration of what his intentions are . "
what is it that is triggering this new found determination to move forward , even unilaterally ? "
senate democrat leader tom daschle president george w bush has called congressional leaders to the white house for talks about iraq later on wednesday , in an apparent attempt to drum up domestic support for a possible us attack .
the uk prime minister , tony blair , earlier gave a clear signal that he will support us military action against iraq if saddam hussein fails to give unrestricted access to united nations weapons inspectors .
speaking to the media on tuesday , mr blair promised to publish evidence of iraq 's alleged development of weapons of mass destruction .
arab diplomats said iraq will seek backing from arab foreign ministers who are due to discuss the growing crisis with america at a meeting of the arab league in cairo on wednesday .
' no firm direction ' white house spokesman ari fleischer said mr bush 's meeting with senior republican and democrat politicians was part of the president 's consultations on security , iraq and the war on terror .
the president is expected to try to allay fears that he is about to embark on a war without getting proper backing from congress , amid signs of a rift within the bush administration and growing international opposition to a military strike .
mr fleischer recalled a speech that mr bush made in january , in which he said he wanted weapons inspectors to go back to iraq .
but shortly after his statement , the us defence secretary , donald rumsfeld , said it was very unlikely that renewed inspections would produce any useful result .
" i have n't seen any inclination on their -lsb- iraqi -rsb- part to agree to anything except as a ploy from time to time to ... play the international community and the un process like a guitar , " mr rumsfeld said .
congress uneasy the bbc 's justin webb in washington says that in the absence of any firm direction from the white house , congressional leaders are increasingly voicing their concerns on the iraq issue .
senate democrat leader tom daschle has said he intends to persuade mr bush that the constitution requires him to ask congressional permission before waging a war .
" what information do you have specifically that would lead us to take any action ? "
mr daschle said .
" what is it that is triggering this new found determination to mover forward , even unilaterally ? "
on tuesday , iraqi deputy prime minister tariq aziz said baghdad was prepared to co-operate with the un on the issue of the return of weapons inspectors .
after talks with un secretary general kofi annan , mr aziz said iraq could readmit un inspectors only as part of a " comprehensive settlement " that would see the end of economic sanctions and threats from the us .
but mr powell dismissed the iraqi offer as nonsense and a con .

researchers at cardiff university claim in a new book that the eviction costs should be used to spend on legal camps for those affected .
cardiff 's traveller law research unit estimates that a third of the 300,000 gypsies and travelling people were on unauthorised sites , often lacking access to water or toilets .
frequently , there are ugly scenes to evict travellers from illegal sites .
in 1999 , 100 police officers , bailiffs and council officials moved in to evict gypsies from a 13-year-old site at croesnewydd , wrexham , north wales .
the process involved gaining a costly high court notice .
rachel morris who helped write the new book says it costs at least as much as it would to provide more legal sites .

the proposed legislation would create a commission to work towards creating sites for travellers without having to rely on councils .
the traveller law unit has spent five years looking into social exclusion and deprivation experienced by travellers and gypsies .
eviction ms morris added that if a gypsy needed a site to live on they often had to buy their own and apply for planning permission , which is often refused due to local opposition .
" there are n't enough available sites , " she said .
" many are being closed down by local authorities and those that do exist are either next to motorways and in laybys . "
local authorities have said when they evict they are acting in support of local ratepayers angered by illegal camping , and the illegal dumping which often goes with it .
many gypsies and travellers are now settled on sites but say they miss the freedom of movement which their parents and grandparents had .

students will be encouraged to debate hot personal finance topics as well as complete money-related exercises .
the aim is to turn pupils into informed and critical users of financial services steven stillwell , fsa personal finance has been taught in some schools since 2000 .
but now personal finance lessons will play a key part in the government 's new citizenship course .
but the course will not automatically lead to a gcse exam and schools will be able to circumnavigate personal finance teaching .
catching the bug marie garside , deputy head of st ambrose barlow comprehensive in salford saw her pupils catch the money bug when the school was chosen for a personal finance studies pilot in 1998 .
teachers and children at st ambrose barlow school " it 's all about putting the world into context for the pupil .
studying personal finance helps them with their mathematics and builds confidence , " ms garside told bbc news online .
pupils from age 11 upwards have learned financial management skills and even run an in-school jewellery shop .
parents have also got involved in the school 's activities volunteering to give talks on money topics .
hurdles the personal finance curriculum has been put together by the department for education and skills -lrb- dfes -rrb- in consultation with the personal finance education group -lrb- pfeg -rrb- .
the pfeg , formed last november , contains representatives from consumer groups , the city watchdog the financial services authority , as well as high street banks .
wendy van den hende , the pfeg director , believes there are considerable hurdles to overcome before personal finance is as widely taught as history or english .
" the worry is that teachers think that personal finance is out of the comfort zone .
as a result there is a danger that personal finance education will be marginalised , " she said .
informed and critical according to steven stillwell , financial services authority spokesman , the new personal finance curriculum is divided into two .
pupils under age 14 are given basic lessons about bank accounts and mortgages .
older pupils , though , are taught about the possible implications of the financial decisions they make .
" the aim is to turn pupils into informed and critical users of financial services , " said mr stillwell .

they are quite cynically targeted and pressured into parting with lifetime savings - often by deception david harker , nacab director the national association of citizens advice bureaux -lrb- nacab -rrb- says a disproportionate number of the cases it deals with arise from unscrupulous doorstep selling .
as a result , nacab has lodged a ' super-complaint ' with the government calling for immediate action against the worse offenders .
the consumer group also wants to see legislation introduced to protect consumers .
inflated prices the main gripes include salespeople giving misleading information , and selling unsuitable equipment at inflated prices .
nacab claim that some door-to-door salespeople even refuse to leave when asked to by the householder .
in one case a woman was told she had won a prize to have her sofa cleaned .
the salesperson called the next day , cleaned the sofa then persuaded the woman to buy the cleaner at a cost of £ 2,000 .
she tried to cancel the next day but was refused a refund .
cynical targeting nacab have handed the office of fair trading -lrb- oft -rrb- a dossier of 1500 cases relating to doorstep selling .
the main offenders are home improvement and gas and electricity salespeople .
often the elderly and disabled are the victims .
" they are quite cynically targeted and pressured into parting with lifetime savings - often by deception , " said nacab director david harker .
super-complaint since the beginning of the year consumer groups have been able to lodge a super-complaint with the oft if they feel urgent action is needed .
at present there is a seven day cooling-off period for consumers that buy from unsolicited door-to-door sellers .
nacab would like to see this period extended to two weeks and for it to include sales made as a result of pre-arranged appointments .
the consumer group also wants the oft to use its ' stop now ' powers to crack down hard on firms that allow sales people to act unscrupulously .
report within a year in response , the oft has not ruled out the use of stop now powers against door-to-door sellers and is duty bound to reply to a super-complaint within 90 days .
paul matthews , oft spokesman , told bbc news online that they welcomed the nacab move and a full report into doorstep selling could be ready within a year .
in the meantime , mr matthews recommended that consumers take precautions when dealing with door-to-door salespeople .
householders should check salesperson identities before letting them through the door .
in addition , the oft recommends that consumers get salespeople to call back if they are given any complex reading material .
your comments : door to door sales people are pushy to the extreme .
they do n't care how they make that sale or who they sell too .
unfortunately older people tend to be polite and give people the time of day .
this is the wrong strategy .
the only way to deal with sales people is to say no and close the door , or put the phone down .
richard hough , uk tele-sales people from the gas and electricity seem to be the worst offenders - they seem to get my address correct but i never receive any explanatory materials through the post .
it seems they are as ' guilty ' at attempting to pressure consumers as the foot-in-the-door salespeople are .
keith halewood , uk i 've found a huge increase in the aggressive doorstep ' selling ' from charity organisations .
staff who are on commission rates are acting as forcefully as the ' traditional ' doorstep sellers .
obviously charities are still regarded as a separate entity but appear to be employing the same strong arm tactics. keri collins , uk i have been a successful door-door sales man myself and came in the top 10 as a rep and a team manager , always being honest .
what needs to be taken in to account is that many of these sales people are only doing what they have been taught to do by their employers .
rob tucker , wales having sold books door to door in america , and double glazing for a uk firm , i can safely say that the majority of door to door salesmen are reputable .
it is a shame however that some use confusion and threatening behaviour to make the sale at any cost .
julian , england it 's not only door to door salespeople that have taken a more aggressive sales pitch .
telephone and street salespeople bombard you with questions as you pass promising " only two minutes of your time " .
they should be able to understand when no means no !
gareth , s.wales marketing is evil !
this is another irritating facet of modern life .
we are constantly harassed to buy things we do n't need in increasingly unscrupulous ways .
the worst has to be lifestyle image marketing at children .
anthony lorton , uk double glazing salespeople are still the worst , it took four hours to get one to leave my house -lrb- this was at midnight ! -rrb- and then only getting rude and verbally forcefull .
comments that these people are only doing what they are told / taught is a cop-out , i worked in retail sales for over 8 years and would never have resorted to some of the method used by these people .
an individual makes their own moral choices , not their boss .
gideon liddiard , uk i worked in the " pressure sales " industry for a " very " short time and the goal is to sell the product for as high a price as possible .
we were told to try and sell for between £ 3000 - £ 4000 but we could drop this down to just £ 400 if we wished as this was the actual cost .
anything above the £ 400 was split 50/50 with the parent company .
i never made a sale as i just was n't the type of guy who could con people .
the best rule i can offer is never buy from a dooor to door salesman as the product will have an inflated price to cover their commission .
graeme tuck , uk it should be made illegal to attempt to sell at peoples doors .
if i want to buy something i 'll go shopping .
i do not want to discuss my business with a stranger on my door step .
clive , uk how is it that we have the telephone preference service and mailing preference service to allow us to opt out of receiving marketing via telephone and post but any salesman has a right to turn up at our doors unannounced to sell goods in any way they choose ?
jason huntley , england having done a brief stint as a double glazing telesales person i am not surprised .
when we were asked to watch the ' best ' people on the phone i watched one girl rubbing her hands together in glee at the sound of an elderly voice on the phone ; it was generally known that older people were often desperate for someone to talk to and if confused would often just agree to what they were told by a forceful person .
i lasted 3 days in that job ...
j fernandes , uk i do n't see what the fuss is all about .
remember many successful companies have been built up where the founders started life " on the knock " to even suggest a ban on door to door salesman is another nail in the coffin for freedom of speech and human rights .
david stevens , uk i would like to see a voluntary ban on doorstep selling by all energy retailers .
it has become obvious that self regulation has not worked , and who could expect it to when they contract agencies which employ people on a commission only basis to manage their doorstep selling .
i personally will not buy anything on my doorstep , nor via telesales .
maybe if we all did this then this problem would go away !
chris reid , uk i had a visit at the door a few months ago from a double glazing saleswoman .
my house -lrb- fitted with double glazing as standard -rrb- and the estate i live on is only five years old .
i suggested to the saleswoman that the company should do its research and target areas with old housing that might need replacement windows .
she then informed me that new houses need replacement windows after five years , a blatant lie !
mike hatfield , great britain do n't be a sheep , the wolf at your door is there to take your money .
it makes me laugh when they always follow the standard book of rules to get that sale .
" i 'll just ring the office " , " show home " , " special discount " , starting at 500 % mark up .
i feel sorry for those that fall for these practices .
simon , uk i 've worked in business to business telesales & marketing for the last 14 years and i can honestly say that i would never buy of a door to door salesperson , street vendor or give money to a charity via a " charity mugger " .
if we all say no or if you do sign then cancel within the 14 day cooling off period they will all fade away soon enough .
jason , manchester , england i find this very upsetting .
my grandmother , who is 91 , keeps being harrassed by door-to-door salesman unfortunately , she gets confused and tends to trust them .
she must have changed electricity supplier three or four times in the past year .
in the worst cases , we have even found that the salesman has forged her signature .
let 's hope the oft does something about it .
ben , england cold-knocking and equally cold-calling should be outlawed .
luke , england the high street banks are particular offenders of " junk phone " selling .
my usual response is to ask for the details to be sent to me in the post .
i always get the same reply : " oh , we ca n't do that ! "
the high stret banks should set an example : their reputation is already badly tarnished as a supplier of consumer services .
mr. alan hall , england cold calling door to door sales should be made illegal , but with special provisions for charities .
paul hibberson , uk i would have to agree with david stevens of the uk .
we are slowly becoming a society ruled by regimented systems .
i think there should be sensible steps to rule out those few who abuse the door to door system but otherwise people have a choice as to whether to open the door .
stephanie aitkins , uk my wife is registered blind , but our two sons are still living at home with us .
they both stand at well over 6 feet tall .
it is a brave / foolhardy salesman who stands his ground when my wife calls them to the door .
john , uk the comments of some salespeople here suggest they are highly driven .
if they are statistically more likely to obtain a sale by pressuring the elderly and vulnerable , of course they will do so !
i firmly agree there ought to be tighter regulation of unsolicited sales calls of any nature .
lee , uk i feel that we have to remember why telephone sales staff and door to door sales men are ' pushy ' , it is because many are paid on commission and have to meet certain targets for bonus ' etc , so i feel that the major companies sould be targeted with this complaint , if they paid a regular , decent wage the staff would not need to be so extreme .

luke , england the high street banks are particular offenders of " junk phone " selling .
my usual response is to ask for the details to be sent to me in the post .
i always get the same reply : " oh , we ca n't do that ! "
the high stret banks should set an example : their reputation is already badly tarnished as a supplier of consumer services .
mr. alan hall , england cold calling door to door sales should be made illegal , but with special provisions for charities .
paul hibberson , uk i would have to agree with david stevens of the uk .
we are slowly becoming a society ruled by regimented systems .
i think there should be sensible steps to rule out those few who abuse the door to door system but otherwise people have a choice as to whether to open the door .
stephanie aitkins , uk my wife is registered blind , but our two sons are still living at home with us .
they both stand at well over 6 feet tall .
it is a brave / foolhardy salesman who stands his ground when my wife calls them to the door .
john , uk the comments of some salespeople here suggest they are highly driven .
if they are statistically more likely to obtain a sale by pressuring the elderly and vulnerable , of course they will do so !
i firmly agree there ought to be tighter regulation of unsolicited sales calls of any nature .
lee , uk i feel that we have to remember why telephone sales staff and door to door sales men are ' pushy ' , it is because many are paid on commission and have to meet certain targets for bonus ' etc , so i feel that the major companies sould be targeted with this complaint , if they paid a regular , decent wage the staff would not need to be so extreme .
rebecca , wales i agree with clive , ban door-to-door salesmen and , whilst we 're at it , ban junk / unsoilicited mail as well -lrb- think of the trees we will save -rrb- rab , uk related to this story : how to keep your life junk free -lrb- 05 aug 02 -pipe- dot life -rrb- get your foot off my doorstep ! -lrb- 21 may 02 -pipe- working lunch -rrb- energy firms told to stop mis-selling -lrb- 23 may 02 -pipe- business -rrb- internet links : direct selling association -pipe- national association of citizens advice bureaux -lrb- nacab -rrb- -pipe- office of fair trading -lrb- oft -rrb- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point business contents : e-commerce -pipe- economy -pipe- market data ^ ^ back to top -pipe- bbc news home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- feedback -pipe- ©

the association of chief police officers in scotland -lrb- acpos -rrb- said the message about the danger of carrying knives must be driven home , especially to young men .
that call was echoed by victim support scotland which said knife attacks had a terrible effect on the victims .
the scottish national party said it wanted to see new measures to tackle scotland 's knife culture but the scottish executive has argued that the latest statistics show that a police crackdown is working .
later this month , the bbc is holding a " crime day " .
click here to find out how you can take part .
the latest figures for knife crime and the use of offensive weapons were published in the scottish parliament following questions by the snp .
they show that convictions for carrying an offensive weapon rose from 227 in 1996 to 1,137 in 2000 .
convictions up the number of people convicted of having a weapon with a blade or point in a public place leapt from 317 to 1,101 .
strathclyde police assistant chief constable graeme pearson , speaking for acpos , said : " what we need to do is , in the years to come , make it as unacceptable for someone to carry a knife as it is now unacceptable to drink and drive .
" someone who walks the street with a knife should be seen as someone beyond the pale . "
david mckenna , from victim support scotland , said : " we 've seen increasing levels of violence over the last five to 10 years and indeed that has often been associated with youth crime and carrying weapons like knives and blades .
" the sad thing is it 's young people committing crime against young people .
" violence is on the increase , the police are doing a lot about it but we still need to do a lot more . "
claims rejected snp leader john swinney said that the figures were clear evidence of an unprecedented upsurge in scotland 's knife culture .
he said new ways of tackling the problem - including stiffer sentences - must be explored .
however , justice minister jim wallace said the snp claims were false .
he said the increases in convictions were actually proof of an enormously successful crackdown on knife crime by the police and scotland 's legal system .

ordnance survey staff from across britain , will be plotting and charting the contours of the town , to update the main computer database of uk maps .
the 250 strong team , will visit the town - which has history dating back to the roman times - on wednesday and thursday , to carry out a detailed survey of the area .
their work will include surveying the shape of every building , finding the alignment of every road and pavement , and even discovering the exact locations of public telephone boxes .
the mapping exercise is the first of its kind to ever be undertaken by the organisation .
" normally , ordnance survey staff work in small teams all over britain gathering fresh information to add to the database - with a total of 5000 changes being made every night , " said charlie payne , operations manager for ordnance survey - wales and west of england .
" the monmouth project is being undertaken as part of a special team-building exercise .
" staff who often work in relative isolation will be able to get to know each other more , pick up fresh ideas to solve problems and help speed their work , " he said .
preliminary work by photogrammetric staff in southampton - who produce maps based on aeriel photography - has already been carried out .
they have used digital technology to produce three dimensional models of the town .
this information has been loaded on to hand-held computers along with previous map data , to help surveyors in their task .
new street names and property numbers will be added to the new maps when they are produced .
paula good , a spokeswoman for ordnance survey , said that monmouth was picked from a number of towns in britain that needed to be completed .
" when we looked at which town would be best to map out in two days , monmouth was chosen .
" it is going to be a mini conference and the surveyors really wanted to put their skills to use - it is part work and part team building .
" they felt they could do the whole town from scratch - it is going to be very intensive . "

there was more disciplinary action taken over inappropriate surfing and sending pornographic e-mails in the last year than all the cases for dishonesty , violence and health and safety breaches put together .

nearly 40 % of those sending pornographic e-mails were sacked , although there appeared to be a more laissez-faire attitude to pornographic material on the web , with only 17 % of those looking at such sites being dismissed .

just when you are completing a tricky flanking manoeuvre , or have got to the darkest point of a dungeon , the phone will ring , a partner will want to talk or your dinner will be on the table .
but israeli game maker majorem could have a solution to this problem , at least for players of its forthcoming ballerium online game .
the company has developed an artificial intelligence system that learns a gamer 's style of play and can take over and play for them if they have to spend time away from the game .
style points ballerium is an online real-time strategy game in which players create empires by controlling and creating groups of creatures , building cities and castles and gathering money and magical items .

adi gaash , co-founder and chief executive of majorem , said only by completing a series of quests would players be able to secure all the parts to build the gate .
he said many players of online games become frustrated because their lifestyle limited their interaction with a game world .

" the ai is based on genetic algorithms and can learn a player 's style , " mr gaash told the bbc programme go digital .

genetic algorithms work by copying techniques from biology to breed the best solution to a problem .
typically they involve creating lots of slightly different solutions to a problem , testing to see which perform best and then taking and randomly mutating these to produce a new batch that are again tested , mutated and so on .
mr gaash said majorem was already testing ballerium with thousands of players and the final game should be released in february 2003 .

simon moss has to be careful about what he says .
for one thing , the client list at the software company he runs is expanding rapidly , and not all the big-hitter financial institutions he deals with are ready to go public about the relationship just yet .
but as we sit in mantas 's office in leafy fairfax , just outside washington dc - an office which , incidentally , is being rebuilt and extended around us to cope with extra demand - it 's obvious that there 's another reason : that a spot of circumspection is simply the only decent way to proceed . "

and the boost to business came a year ago , in the wake of the outrage that hit the us on 11 september .
catching up it 's not a matter of capitalising on tragedy .
it 's simply that the financial world has finally woken up to the reality of dirty money , and is desperately seeking experts to help it cope with a flood of new rules , regulations and practices .
banks which hitherto paid little more than lip service to the need to " know your customer " - a mantra in the anti-funny money business - suddenly find they need to prove just how much they care .
some of the pressure , at least in the us , comes from new legal obligations laid down in the the wide-ranging usa patriot act of october 2001 , which set timetables for a range of financial institutions to shape up .
and so , in the rush to demonstrate their keenness to comply , it makes sense to drop a bundle of dollars on software from mantas or its uk-based competitor searchspace - between them the 800-pound gorillas of the business .
mr moss wo n't put numbers on the increase in business since 9/11 , but new clients include huge banking conglomerates like citigroup .
thanks to usa patriot it 's not just banks who need the help .
online broker charles schwab is also on the list of those who have recently jumped aboard .
long haul unsurprisingly , simon moss is at pains to stress the business benefits beyond complying with the law .
the software , he says , gets a business more in touch with its clients , more aware of their needs - as well as snooping on their potential for illicit dealings .
but he cautions that simply buying in expertise is no magic bullet .
it can take months or even years to see the true benefits , to train the software - which scans every single transaction a bank makes , and - using thousands of " rules " - looks for patterns , unusual links between names and accounts , and behaviour which diverges from past experience .
" we 're in the slightly dubious business of managing expectations , " he says .
" we 're a linchpin component -lrb- in an overall strategy -rrb- but we 're no panacea . "
seek and ye shall find then again , managing expectations is pretty much all that many organisations are after .
as well as mantas , there are an army of companies offering rapid searches of databases both public and private , to reassure an institution that its customers are indeed who they say they are .

an annual spend of more than $ 1m is the norm , according to ted fraumann , a 27-year veteran of the fbi and now a partner at new york-based business integrity international , a firm involved in business intelligence , investigations and security matters .
that cost is one reason why a group of 15 international banks , including such luminaries as goldman sachs and ubs warburg , have set up their own company to perform the searches for them .
regulatory data corp , as it is called , has former fbi and cia directors on its board , and is intended to turn the cost of " knowing your customer " into an opportunity to sell on the service elsewhere .
the real benefit of these services , though , is that they allow the institutions to assure themselves that they 're in compliance with the strict rules and timetable the usa patriot act laid down .
" it 's a huge industry , " mr fraumann says .
" but we question whether it 's enough . "
in other words , he fears that the complacency which predominated before 11 september has now turned to a " check-box " approach .

now , though , it means that an institution can tell the government they have a person in place to watch over their compliance with the new rules - a key requirement of usa patriot .
and a cso sufficiently senior in his - and it usually is a " his " - old job will bring added benefits .
" they want your rolodex , " says mr fraumann .
but not for your underworld contacts , your line into the terrorists ' organisations , but for your ability to get a heads-up from ex-colleagues about upcoming issues .
and that allows the institutions to make sure they do n't have to go any farther , spend any more money , than they need to .
after all , it took years for anyone to take money laundering seriously .
it may well take years more for the new emphasis on terrorism to become part of the furniture too .

in between , it embraces much of the heartbreak of young love .
the novel represents a life journey of sorts for actor-cum-writer ethan hawke , who uses his work to confront the life issues which concern many of those easing out of their 20s into their 30s .
why are we really here and what does it matter anyway ?
these are the questions the 31-year-old actor , husband of uma thurman and father to two young children , seems to be asking .
but he does it with a fast-moving , natural dialogue which can not fail to entertain .
the book is hawke 's second novel his hero -lrb- or is it anti-hero ? -rrb- is a disillusioned and aptly named us army staff sergeant jimmy heartsock , aged 31 , who thinks he is in love and is about to unwittingly become a father .
but he still has to come to terms with the suicide of his vietnam veteran father ; indeed it was his death that propelled him into the forces several years before .
heartsock relies on recreational drugs to get him through the darker moments in life , including telling the family of a young serviceman he has been killed in a bar brawl .
heartsock 's opposite number is his pregnant girlfriend christy walker , who is from a different background altogether - middle class , middle america , with a womanising father and a mother who walked out when she was a baby .
after a rocky proposal in a frozen car park , they take a car journey together across mid-state usa back to jimmy 's roots , to get married and confront reality en route .
much of the book is based on personal experience heartsock seeks out the religion he was forced to endure as a child -lrb- hence the religious connotations of the book 's title -rrb- and christy finally realises that she does want to spend her life with this juvenile man .
it is an everyday story of everyday life , happening no doubt to thousands of couples across the us .
what carries it through is the strength of hawke 's characterisation and the crisp , up-front dialogue .
by writing both in the persona of jimmy and his girlfriend christy , hawke is able to give the reader a dual perspective .
the novel offers a cathartic experience - i suspect for the writer as well as the reader .
ash wednesday is published on 5 september by bloomsbury .

the book tells the story of a young couple who go on a journey across america and have to confront their past , present and future along the way .

but what did you think ?
is it a tale you can relate to ?
is ethan hawke a talented novelist ?
i 've always thought ethan hawke was a very talented actor , i remember watching him in the dead poets society when i was younger .
i bought his first book simply because i had money in my pocket and a desire to do so .
i also wanted to see if it was any good !
i was more than impressed , it 's very down to earth , does n't try and be too clever and the characters , events and morals are very likeable .
he has a definite talent for writing in my opinion .

the book tells the story of a young couple who go on a journey across america and have to confront their past , present and future along the way .
" what carries it through is the strength of hawke 's characterisation and the crisp , up-front dialogue , " says the bbc 's clare gabriel .
but what did you think ?
is it a tale you can relate to ?
is ethan hawke a talented novelist ?
have your say i 've always thought ethan hawke was a very talented actor , i remember watching him in the dead poets society when i was younger .
i bought his first book simply because i had money in my pocket and a desire to do so .
i also wanted to see if it was any good !
i was more than impressed , it 's very down to earth , does n't try and be too clever and the characters , events and morals are very likeable .
he has a definite talent for writing in my opinion .

a delegation from the western isles has travelled to edinburgh with the message that the scottish executive is not doing enough to support gaelic .
they believe that the creation of a gaelic language act is required to safeguard its future .
but the executive said that to do so would represent an inappropriate use of resources .
we feel that the government should be supporting our language cathy mary macmillan there are an estimated 2,000 children currently going through gaelic-medium education and the number of people speaking the language is decreasing .
the gaelic students said if the executive did not act now then the language 's future would be in doubt .
supporters of a future act are calling for gaelic advisers to be located in a permanent parliamentary department .
they also want a rise in funding for gaelic courses in further education colleges plus their own broadcasting station .
cathy mary macmillan told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that official status should be granted .
legal status " we feel that the government should be supporting our language , as it is a minority language , " she said .
" the media is only a small part of the language and we have to consider education and the communities .
" the need is not only in the highlands and islands but it is scotland-wide . "
secure status would give the language security for further funding , development and opportunities , she added .
however , tourism and culture minister mike watson said that a language act would not be considered .
mike watson said gaelic was being supported he said : " legal status would mean a requirement for gaelic to be taught across the whole of scotland and that would not be an appropriate use of executive resources .
" but i am putting as many resources as i can into developing the language . "
the minister said he could not justify legal status for the language if it meant gaelic teaching in the borders and fife where demand was low .
he said that the executive was allocating funds to teacher training and had made significant progress over the past year .
however , mr watson said he was not opposed to the idea of discussing the idea further in the parliament .
he said a bill proposed by the scottish national party would be discussed in due course .
an official report in may called for the introduction of a language act .
the report , entitled a fresh start for gaelic , was prepared by the ministerial advisory group on gaelic , which was led by professor donald meek of edinburgh university .

ms armstrong , 40 , started her firm , second nature , in 1999 after using wool to insulate her own home .
she found that nobody had developed the idea for sale in the uk , so refined her product using the unwanted wool from local hill sheep into her product " thermafleece " .
' remarkable figure ' the firm now lists the national trust among its customers .
she has been praised for bringing diversity to an area that suffered economically in last year 's foot-and-mouth outbreak .
harris jones , chief executive officer of the award 's sponsor , t-mobile , said she was a " remarkable figure " .
presenting the awards , martin townsend , editor of the sunday express , which co-sponsored the scheme , described thermafleece as an " inspiring " story .

british workers dream about working shorter hours over winning the lottery , according to the government 's work-life balance survey .
twice as many women now put in over 60 hours a week as in the year 2000 , research by the department of trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- and management today magazine has found .
young people are labouring the hardest , with most of the 60 hour-week workers being in their 30s .
full-time retail employees clock up more hours than any other sector workers .
overtime is an especially bad deal , with only a third of workers awarded extra pay or time off in lieu for it and londoners doing an average of 12 extra hours every week .
why do the british work such long hours ?
are you overdoing it ?
how can we find a happy balance between our professions and our personal lives ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction the expectation that uk employees work excessive non-contractual unpaid hours is one of the typical failures of british management -lrb- adopted in part from us practices -rrb- .
the lack of respect and loyalty thus demonstrated to employees has a downside which shows in reduced productivity and reduced flexibility .
if employees are working excessive hours , the company shareholders should be checking to see whether the company management team is really making effective long term use of the company 's most valuable asset - the people .
andy bishop , uk " the problem in this country is that we have too many accountants " john hanley , uk i recently went on a self-catering holiday to france and called at a supermarket and found that it had closed for lunch-for two hours ! in fact everyone had gone home for lunch .
it 's a system that works .
the employees are all well motivated etc . , and the employers get much more productivity from their workforce without the need for extra hours .
the problem in this country is that we have too many accountants .
we have ten / twenty times the number they have on the continent and suffer as a result - if you 've got a piece of equipment / place of work , it must be in production 24/7 .
this is rubbish , it 's not how long you work it 's what you do that counts , remember work expands to fill time allocated .
john hanley , uk brits work long hours and our economy is doing ok .
the europeans work much shorter hours , but their economies are in recession and their unemployment rate is double hours .
anyone notice a pattern here ?
guy hammond , england this long hour culture is totally counter productive .
recent stats show that both germany and france where " workers " are treated with respect and not just like slaves are far more productive than here in sweatshop uk .
but then again it 's in the authorities ' interest not to give us time to think .
andrew watson , england society is to blame with the majority of people wanting better cars , better houses , holidays abroad and to spend , spend , spend rather than living sensibly within their means .
they resort to overtime to get what they want and end up with ill health due to stress and exhaustion .
steve , uk you can work your butt off in the servitude of your company .
you can sweat , slave and sacrifice everything to show " loyalty " to your company .
and what happens ?
the first sign of an economic downturn and a dip in profits and the company will return that loyalty by dumping you .
do n't do it .
just say no !
tony , london , uk it so typically british to moan on about long hours but still carry on working them .
you have the power to say " i 'm going home now " or get another job .
stop complaining and do something about it !
dan , uk having worked my way up to a senior position within a large american corporation , i felt it " part of the job " to consistently work 50 + hours every week .
despite all my efforts and 13 years service , i -lrb- along with many others -rrb- was made redundant with not so much as a thank-you .
you live and learn , and i now put my family first .
nigel , england i find this whole long hours culture really puzzling .
who does it benefit ?
certainly not those working long hours .
and as an employer , i would far rather have happy , healthy , and therefore productive staff working 35 hours a week than stressed staff sitting at their desks -lrb- although not necessarily working -rrb- for 60 hours .
adam , uk how can we find a happy balance between our professions and our personal lives ?
the answer is to stop being so greedy .
fiona , wales i recently left my employment of over 27 years partly due to the stress of the continuous extra workload being suddenly heaped on me due to colleagues taking release for much the same reason .
although we were expected to work an average of 36 hours -lrb- not including breaks -rrb- in actual practice to keep ahead i found myself having to work nearer 50 hours without remuneration of any kind .
hazel , uk " i was so stressed and overworked last year that i contracted meningitis " elliott , uk i was so stressed and overworked last year that i contracted meningitis as a direct result of being so run down .
it was a relief to be made redundant !
there is something wrong with british working society that deems anyone to be ill or needing time off to be inferior .
that 's why nobody wants to be the first to go to lunch if they go to lunch at all , let alone take time off work for rest and recuperation .
elliott , uk after living and working in the us from 1990 to 2001 it 's a real pleasure to come back to the uk for a rest .
brian , uk if the government really want british workers to find a balance , how about reducing the amount of tax and vat we have to pay on everything ?
we do not work extra hours for the love of it , we do it because we need to eat and pay for our housing .
the average wage is not enough to live on anymore .
rich , uk " let 's have another go at the three day week ! "
mark jason , uk the survey is spot on .
this trend has increased massively in the last two years .
employers seem to show disdain at workers who have the audacity to merely work their contracted hours .
without overtime , we 're working for apparently nothing .
it leaves little time or energy for a social life .
there must be more to life .
let 's have another go at the three day week !
mark jason , uk most of the blame should be placed on the employers , as pay-rates outside of london do n't reflect house prices / rent and the general cost of living .
the employee often has no other choice -lrb- especially with the amount of temporary jobs out there -rrb- but to work more hours .
simon , uk i originally come from hungary but lived all my adult life in england .
i was shocked to see what people do at work once i started to work in the city of london .
everyone feels under pressure to go in to work earlier than the boss and go home later than the boss so that they appear hard-working .
taking lunch away from your desk is unheard of !
but they are not at all working hard or are productive .
we should take a look at europe - work hard and effectively all day and go home on time !
have a life and do n't feel bad for doing so !
marianne , uk " other countries have less material gain and close-knit family " mark dickinson , nottingham , england the main problem in this country is the culture of ' got to have it all ' .
other countries are prepared to have a little less material gain and have a much superior quality of life with a close-knit family .
is it any wonder that we are producing a succession of kids who think that materialism / consumerism is the only thing that matters ?
mark dickinson , nottingham , england people work such long hours to impress ; often people will just stay at work doing nothing to make people see that they are working hard .
the nation needs to change its attitude towards work , you can achieve just as much in a few hours hard work as you can working at a leisurely pace throughout the whole day .
will , uk i 'm pretty sure that those saying they work 60 hour plus weeks are not being entirely truthful .
it is probably that they " sometimes " work 60 hour weeks , just as school students -lrb- and teachers -rrb- sometimes spend a long time doing / marking coursework etc .
the truth is that most people who work these long hours are doing it for their own benefit to get extra pay , get noticed by management , get away from the wife !
its quite easy to say no to overtime when you do n't want it / cant do it .
a bit of flexibility by both sides will sort things out .
businesses aren ¿ t hideous greedy monsters -lrb- no more than you are anyway -rrb- and your manager has been in the same position .
just say no sometimes and work more intelligently .. not just more .
david phillips , uk finding a balance is always a nice concept , but social attitudes tip the balance further and further towards the workplace .
we are living in a faster and faster moving society and britain is becoming a more productive country because of the hard work being done .
today 's society is less and less family oriented and revolves more and more around the workplace so it is hardly a surprise that we spend more time in it .
richard frizoni , uk " everyone else toes the line " john b , uk while it is arguably a bit churlish to religiously leave at bang on 5:00 it is also unreasonable to expect people to sacrifice their entire lives for the sake of the company .
people are afraid to stand up for themselves and refuse to be treated badly because they fear losing their job if everyone else toes the line .
i think we as a nation are also conditioned to define ourselves more in terms of what we do rather than who we are .
john b , uk let 's not forget that by working longer hours we are reducing our employers ' overheads .
this makes uk companies more competitive in an increasingly difficult european market .
david , uk david , thanks for your enlightening observation that were cutting down our employer 's overheads by working longer hours .
i 'll do it more in the future as his jag is at least three years old now and could do with an upgrade to enable it to put my humble renault in it 's place .
greg brown , uk performance drops off radically after not much more than the 35-40 hour week specified in many employment contracts .
there have even been test cases where employees worked only 30-hour weeks .
staff morale and concentration levels rocketed , as did productivity .
but alas , most managers continue to place their own superficial understanding ahead of doing their homework , and their groups suffer as a result .
chris , uk britons work longer hours and have less holiday than most other european countries .
we need to take action now , or we will become the sweatshop of europe .
charlie , uk most uk companies seem to be blind to the relationship between morale and productivity .
couple this with a management attitude that says your time is the company 's unless they decide otherwise and you have the perfect recipe for stressed-out , overworked employees .
richard p , uk " i 'm currently reading the bbc website .
it 's 5.15 on friday afternoon . "
jim taylor uk sitting at your desk does n't mean you 're working .
i 'm currently reading the bbc website .
it 's 5.15 on friday afternoon .
frankly i should go home .
have a nice weekend everyone .
jim taylor , uk we work long hours , and then work overtime in the belief that we will gain some financial gain for ourselves , and a productivity gain for our employers .
neither are true , we just get taxed more and the extra work is rarely even noticed .
paul , uk there is an increasing feeling of uncertainty in employees long term job status , hence the pressure to work extra " just in case " .
this produces the downward cycle of increasing hours , fear of job loss / lack of promotion , and the feeling of being unable to control one 's life events .
hence the increase presentation to gp 's with stress .
unless the perception is changed , the problem will continue .
philip , uk the thing people overlook is how really bad the ' time at work ' looks when you factor in the hours spent commuting .
slow , delayed and overcrowded trains and a road system where the council 's so-called planners deliberately miss-time traffic lights to create additional delays !
once you add it all up - well , no wonder people dream of downshifting and breeding organic haggis in the highlands .
calum steen , uk my experience in the workplace -lrb- and i 'm sure i 'm not alone -rrb- is one of quantity over quality .
this keeps morale and interest low among the workforce , and profits low for the company .. but big numbers " look good " , so management go for it .
and it all starts with education , where " numbers studying x " are more important than " quality of x 's courses " .
i 've never understood why an employer sees its role as buying a number of hours of your time rather than paying for a particular task to be completed .
hannah g , united kingdom most foreign people i 've spoken to who 've lived in england for a while say it 's a complete myth that england has a better quality of life .
britain is -lrb- and always has been -rrb- about satisfying the needs of business above everything else .
al , uk surely these working hour statistics are being distorted by people using the old trick of buying two jackets with their suit and leaving one hung on the back of the chair ?
then one can slip home , leaving colleagues to presume that you 're busy at a meeting or similar elsewhere in the building ...
calum steen , uk we are the sweatshop of europe .
barbara , uk bleat , bleat , moan , moan !
there 's money out there .
you want it ? ? earn it !
if you do n't , go home .
for a tiny lucky minority , you are born with it or get it handed to you .
for the rest of us , your fate is in your own hands .
if that 's tough , so is life .
andrew carter , uk to andrew carter , not everybody wants to be the next donald trump , some people work to live and not the other way round .
i thought your sort went out of fashion in the eighties !
