more than 25 of germany 's biggest companies are banking on it . in a hall covered in the socialist frescoes of the former east german regime , the crème de la crème of germany 's business gathered to celebrate the founding of a school which will train the next generation of capitalists . at a gathering as a grand as their expectations , the future president and board members of european school of management and technology announced the official grounding of the school they plan to number among the world ’ s elite . in the banquet hall of the former ddr capitol building , the presence of names like german president johannes rau , allianz board chairman henning schulte-noelle and berlin mayor klaus wowereit underscored how serious politics and big business are about the newest and controversial german business school venture . “ our aspirations are high , ” gerhard cromme , coordinator of the 25-company initiative that founded the school told the dark-suited crowd . “ we want the school to be able to measure itself successfully against the best schools in europe as soon as possible . ” high hopes in stopping the brain drain within 10 years time , the school , located in both berlin and munich , expects to have a top-level faculty of 60 and a yearly attendance of around 4,000 .
the founders expect student fees , ranging from 1,000 to 8,000 euro a week , to cover the running costs of the university . an endowment fund currently at 90 million euro , but expected to reach 100 million euro in a few months , will fund research centers the institute plans to establish around europe . the grounding of the school comes at a time when europe 's biggest companies are desperate to stop the " brain drain " of managerial talent to schools in great britain and the united states , said henning schulte-noelle , chairman of the board of management at insurer allianz ag . “ the biggest european economy still does not have a single business school able to old its own among europe ’ s best , ” said schulte-noelle .
especially in germany , he added , “ promising young managerial talents , after having gained their first degree , are looking to the usa to complete their manager qualifications .
often enough , this education exodus means that europe loses these management talents forever . ” older students who need to learn more the school 's target students will be between the ages of 27 and 55 years old , already in middle management and on the upward track to the executive suite at their respective companies . next to executive seminars and training programs , the school will offer mba and master of public administration degrees for the roughly 200 to 300 expected to take part in one-year fulltime programs . many of the details , such as the study programs and classes offered , have yet to be worked out .
derek abell , the school 's first president , evoked names like harvard , stanford and the insead in france as institutions along which the esmt would be modelled . unlike other programs , however , he said the esmt would put an emphasis on europe , leadership and governance skills and practical training . berlin benefits as well the school 's location in berlin will guarantee it access to growing eastern and central european markets and put it in an ideal position when those markets finally boom . the news is also good for the financially strapped city of berlin , which hopes to benefit from the stream of professors , executives and students attending the school .
" we firmly believe the school will make berlin a name to be reckoned with whenever one talks of centers of excellence for business leaders , " mayor klaus wowereit said at the opening . but disagreement remains on who will renovate the old ddr building . berlin , heavily in debt , expects the school to pick up the 25 million euro tab .
the school has so far refused . both sides said thursday they expect a compromise to be reached soon . andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

i have been on the telephone most of the day with my colleagues in the security council and i think we are getting much closer colin powell mr powell was speaking as negotiations continue over a new un resolution on iraq .
chief united nations weapons inspector hans blix has been meeting president george w bush and senior administration officials in washington .
president bush has called for more stringent checks on iraq 's weapons of mass destruction .
the bbc 's jon leyne in washington says the united states is doing all it can to persuade the rest of the world that it is serious about re-starting weapons inspections in iraq .
the aim is to reassure sceptics on the security council that a proposed new un resolution is not just meant as a trigger for war , our correspondent says .
the security council is split on iraq that message was given to the two chief weapons inspectors , hans blix and mohammed al-baradei , when they met president bush at the white house .
the president , according to his spokesman , stressed that he did want to work with the inspectors .
mr powell said the security council was moving closer to an agreement on a new resolutions about iraq .
" i have been on the telephone most of the day with my colleagues in the security council and i think we are getting much closer , " mr powell said on wednesday .
timetable mr powell also said it could be a number of months before the inspectors reported back on iraq 's weapons programme .
this could throw into doubt what many analysts see as a timetable leading to war early next year .
chief un inspector blix wants a tough resolution mr powell was speaking as negotiations continued over a new un resolution on iraq .
progress has been made towards a compromise , but diplomats say that a vote may not take place until next week .
the resolution has been discussed in detail , but there is disagreement about some of the language and a need for further consultation .
under a deal being discussed between the two main protagonists - the united states and france - a first resolution would set down tough new conditions that iraq would have to meet .
if iraq then obstructs weapons inspections , the us has conceded the principle of consulting the security council again before taking military action .
possible compromise but the americans still do not accept the need for a second un resolution before going to war .
the us would take part in any second debate - but would not necessarily be bound by it .
iraq says it will ignore any new resolution bbc news online 's world affairs correspondent paul reynolds says this would allow washington to preserve its claimed right to take unilateral action .
emerging from the security council session on wednesday , the british ambassador to the un , jeremy greenstock , said that britain has no problem whatsoever with what he called a two phase process .
there has been deadlock for weeks over the american insistence on not being tied by the security council and the french and russian determination that the council should have its say before any attack .
as the negotiations grind on , the us military is making preparations for a possible attack on iraq .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- arab women lift the veil on business news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : business news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business e-commerce economy market data entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk thursday , 31 october , 2002 , 06:21 gmt arab women lift the veil on business bahraini women voted for the first time last week by emma clark bbc news online business reporter as part of a weekly series on women in business , bbc news online reports on the feminists of the arab world and the launch of a new women 's organisation .
when laura collins announced she would marry a saudi man , her father extracted one promise from her future husband .
" my father made him swear on his life that he would always allow me to work , " she says .
the promise was kept .
ms collins , an american by birth , now runs a consultancy in saudi arabia , helping women to set up their own businesses .
queen rania helped found the arab women 's organisation many would identify with her father 's trepidation .
arab women swathed in black abayas are often perceived in the west as victims of oppression .
but , unbeknown to many , there has been a discreet but dramatic shift in arab attitudes over the last two or three years .
" now it is very politically correct to address women 's issues , " says haifa fahoum al kaylani , chair of the arab international women 's forum in london .
" it is like a competition between arab governments to encourage women to enter business and the political process . "
suffrage and networks last week , for the first time ever , the gulf state of bahrain allowed women to vote and run for national office .
bahraini women are standing for election similarly , women 's business networks have mushroomed across the middle east , often with the blessing of arab first ladies , such as suzanne mubarak of egypt and queen rania in jordan .
at the end of this week , a summit in amman will launch the arab women 's organisation -lrb- awo -rrb- , under the auspices of the arab league .
the awo , which has been approved by 20 arab countries , will study the conditions for women and aim to harmonise laws across the region .
it is hoped that more progressive countries such as tunisia and egypt will encourage saudi arabia and other conservative societies to embrace change .
the power of education the rise of this embryonic women 's movement has been partly attributed to investment in education by arab rulers in the 1970s .
the literacy rate for women in the arab world has since increased threefold , while school education rates have doubled .
al kaylani : girls want to use their education in bahrain last year , more university degrees were held by women than men .
" girls want to have careers , " says ms al kaylani .
" there has also been a need for -lsb- women to enter the workforce -rsb- because of the worsening economic situation in the region , " she adds .
even in saudi , the government is creating jobs for women as part of a strategy to diversify its economy away from oil .
women 's work there is still plenty to be done .
about half of arab women remain illiterate and segregation of the sexes in some countries provides inevitable obstacles .
in a previous job setting up the riyadh branch of saks fifth avenue , ms collins ' management duties were unusual .
" i supervised men and women , even though they were segregated within the shop .
when i went into the men 's section to talk to them , i would put on my abaya . "
in a more constraining example , women entrepreneurs in saudi must employ a male representative to help obtain a business licence .
there is the odd one or two men who do n't look at me seriously , but the mood is changing mona al moayyed currently saudi women make up 50 % of the population but only contribute to about 3 % of the economy .
" there are n't many available jobs for women in saudi so women are creating their own opportunities , " ms collins says of the many who set up their own businesses .
now , in an unprecedented move , the saudi government has employed ms collins to uncover major barriers faced by business women .
no longer ladies of leisure ?
in bahrain , mona yousuf al moayyed , the first woman to be elected to the board of the bahraini chamber of commerce and industry , is one of the region 's role models .
she is managing director of a family trading business , called y.k. almoayyed & sons , which experienced 20 % growth last year .
al moayyed manages 1,000 people although she admits that many women from her own background are ladies of leisure , she argues that there are greater opportunities than before .
" regulations in bahrain guarantee women 's right to work and they treat them as equal to men . "
the number of women in bahrain 's labour force increased from just over 5 % in 1971 to almost 40 % last year .
" there is the odd one or two men who do n't look at me seriously , but the mood is changing , i am very optimistic , " she says .
but do n't burn the veil despite the thirst for change , many women remain conciliatory to the more conservative elements in their societies .
" you do n't gain anything by antagonising , " warns ms al kaylani .
" you are not there to destroy society .
on the contrary you are there to build a better society . "
at the same time , they take considerable pride in the progress so far .
" we acknowledge there is more work to be done , but what we have achieved is phenomenal - it is truly a solid rock on which to build further , " says ms al kaylani .
