but many insurers are struggling to remain afloat while paying out their holders ’ policies . after suffering through nearly a week of torrential downpours and record-breaking floods , germany and europe are just starting to clean up and calculate the damages .
everywhere one looks , the heavy rainfall and unseasonable storms have left a trail of chaos and destruction .
both private and public property has been ruined , agricultural land has been destroyed , and the infrastructure in large parts of europe has come to a standstill .
" the full extent of damage is not yet definable , " said manfred goedecke , director of the german chambers of industry and commerce , to reporters on wednesday .
the losses are incalculable for households and businesses in the regions most hardest hit .
and of course the damage also effects the insurance industry , which suddenly sees itself forced to pay out large sums of money to policy holders at a time when the industry itself is treading water .
uncertain cost forecasts allianz and many other insurers in europe are reluctant to say how much the recent weather catastrophe will cost them in the end .
but with thousands of households and businesses effected by the flooding , the list of damages is likely to be long , and the claims on the insurance companies high .
" it ’ s too early for an accurate estimate of costs , " helmut perlet , board member of germany ’ s largest insurer allianz , told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" we ’ re still busy cleaning up , " and therefore the dimensions can ’ t yet be calculated .
the federal association of german insurers echoes this thinking , saying " at the time , we can ’ t get a clear overview of how high the claims ’ costs will be . "
but what ’ s certain is that the financial consequences of the flooding will be extensive and exceed the amount insurance companies paid out in earlier years for similar flood and storm coverage .
" the year 2002 will diverge significantly from the long-term average in terms of flood and storm damage claims , " said arno junke , director of germany ’ s branch for general cologne re , the world ’ s third largest re-insurer .
and according to allianz , the amount of damages caused by bad weather has increased fourfold just in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year .
unusual weather leads to unusually high costs weather has always played a role in insurance policy coverage .
one need only think of the annual flooding of the rhine .
but the recent series of natural catastrophes has been more extreme , say industry experts .
" what ’ s new about the newest wave of bad weather is the considerable frequency with which storms and floods have left severe damage behind .
there were always large single catastrophes like hurricane lothar in 1999 .
but now the insurance industry has to deal with an unusually high number of catastrophes with excessive damages , " junke explained .
trouble on the horizon for insurers ?
if the meteorological and industry forecasts hold true and more bad weather strikes europe more often , insurers may find themselves struggling to stay above water .
in the long-term , industry analysts say financially-strapped companies could have difficulty coming up with the cash necessary to pay policy holders filing claims for flood and storm coverage .
" the insurance industry won ’ t be able to shoulder everything , " junke predicts .
this could especially be the case for small insurers suffering from liquidity problems .
large insurance companies such as allianz have faired the storm fairly well , but they too are facing increasing pressure to sell off devalued stocks to cover mounting policy claims .
at the moment allianz says it does not need to readjust its expected yearly gains , however , much is riding on whether or not fall and winter turn out to be stormy seasons .
in this regard , both the insurers and the meteorologists seem to be playing the same game : let ’ s wait and see .
as for an increase in premium costs , insurance experts have said that it ’ s still too early for any clear statements and that only a long-term series of catastrophes would prompt that .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lack in jobs for young people is a sticking point in this year 's election campaign the main issue in this year 's federal election will be germany 's stagnating economy .
however issues , including the role of german military still play a prominent role in all major parties . with more than four million unemployed and a stagnating economy , germany 's biggest parties are focusing on measures to spur growth and get people off the dole in the current election campaign . as germany counts the days to the federal elections on september 22 , the country 's six major political parties are busy stumping with their campaign platforms in an effort to win over undecided and swing voters . three major themes will be at the center of almost all every party platforms this year : the economy , employment and the social insurance system .
similar to the words of former us president bill clinton who once told a senior advisor : " it 's the economy , stupid ! " , german politicians have adopted the economy as the main issue in their election campaigns .
however , this year ’ s slogan is slightly different to clinton 's relatively moderate one ten years before .
today its more like " jobs , jobs , jobs ! " the spd one of the strongest features in this year ’ s election campaign , is the image of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- as protector of the public purse , with finance minister hans eichel as its strict treasurer .
" we 've abandoned the path of becoming a nation of debt and have made that our trademark , " the party 's election platform states .
the party is pledging to submit a balanced budget to parliament by 2006 .
through " solid financial policy , " the social democrats believe they can keep consumer prices stable , boost economic growth and create new jobs . in order to reduce german unemployment – at current more than four million - the spd is seeking to make low-pay jobs more attractive to employees and more affordable for employers .
the government wants to subsidize jobs with below-average low wages with payments between 325 and 800 euro in order to encourage the unemployed to take on what would otherwise be possibly unprofitable jobs . the spd has also pledged special federal job creation aid for germany ’ s eastern states , where unemployment is at a staggering 18 per cent .
the spd has said it will fund the new programs by setting " new priorities " and offering " more focused " social insurance benefits to people living in germany .
party strategists also hope to stretch the existing budget by merging the country 's unemployment and social welfare systems . families also play a central role in the social democrats ' party platform .
the party wants to introduce incremental increases of the german kindergeld , or child allowance , currently paid to families with children from the current 154 euro a month to 200 euro a month .
in the wake of criticism over germany 's dismal performance in the international pisa schools comparison study , the party also also wants to introduce more all-day schools across the country and initiate additional school reform initiatives .
it is prepared to spend 4 billion euro over the next four years to fulfill these ideas . the spd has also proposed reducing tax advantages currently enjoyed by married couples , instead providing them to single parents .
the party also wants to create programs encouraging companies to make more apprenticeships and training programs available , which are required in many vocations before a young person can be given a permanent job . cdu / csu for the first time in their 50-year history , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have come together to create a joint election platform .
citing the “ 40 ” as its magic september 22 number , the so-called union bloc 's priority is to attract a minimum of 40 per cent of voters and to cut to below 40 per cent of the highest tax rate , employment side costs for businesses and the country 's social insurance expenditures as well as the ratio of government expenditures to gross national product . like the spd , the union bloc also has its own proposal for the low-wage sector .
it wants to increase the current combination of low wages and subsidies from 325 euro a month to 400 .
like the spd , the union says combination-wage programs can be made possible by reducing government contributions to other social insurance programs , and that doing so will create new jobs . the union also says it will address the beleaguered eastern german economy with its own revitalization program .
if elected in september , the parties are proposing new laws that would accelerate investment in the sinking construction industry , make it easier for small firms to grow and do a better job of protecting industry in the east . the union also proposes increasing the budget of the bundeswehr , germany 's army .
it says the resource-strapped army , which has been stretched thin with close to 10,000 soldiers currently serving on foreign missions , is in bad need of more money in order to be capable of meeting its international defense obligations under nato and the united nations . the union differentiates itself from the current social democrat and greens-led government in three other key areas : it wants to amend laws currently on the books ordering the closure of all of germany 's nuclear power plants , increases in the country 's environment tax and the recently passed immigration law , which was approved under controversial circumstances in the country 's higher legislative chamber and now faces a federal constitutional court challenge . the greens in march , germany ’ s powerful left-wing party , the greens , voted to amend the uncompromising anti-war plank that had long topped its list of party principles .
however , by this time the party had already made the shift in practice - it was green leader joschka fischer and his party who co-authorized the first use of military force in germany ’ s post-war history , committing troops to nato ’ s 1999 bombing campaign in yugoslavia . in 2001 there followed the second authorization of the deployment of troops abroad , namely to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and in 2001 the third : 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom in the us-led " war on terror " .
the party also turned its back on radical pacifism and accepted the military presence of the united states in europe .
but it did so with an important condition : " the further reduction of our military potential must remain our goal . " this year , the party has set a goal of winning at least eight per cent of voters .
its election platform focuses on the environment , proposals to increase consumer protection and equality .
the greens also want to combine the country 's unemployment and social welfare benefits in order to create a unified safety net for all germans .
a special program within that infrastructure would be aimed at keeping families with children and , especially , single parents from slipping beneath the poverty level .
as it has in previous elections , the green party is also demanding a " society free of gender discrimination . " the free democrats the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has positioned itself as the business-friendly party of tax cuts .
one of its chief goals is to simplify germany 's byzantine tax-filing procedure and replace it with a one-page filing form similar to the 1040ez form which is used in the united states .
the party also wants to cut tax rates to 15 , 25 or 35 per cent based on income . other parties have dismissed the fdp 's lofty tax-cut pledges as implausible .
" ideas like that will sort themselves out very quickly , " said lothar späth , the former ceo of eastern german success story jenaoptik , now a senior political advisor to bavarian premier and opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber . the free democrats are setting their sights on the middle class with campaign slogans like " job machine no. 1 " and calls for leaner government .
education is another central theme in the fdp ’ s party platform .
the free democrats want to spur greater competition in the higher education sector by giving universities and technical colleges greater autonomy . in order to fuel job growth , the fdp wants to liberalize the country 's employment termination laws in order to make firing and , it hopes , hiring easier for the small-sized businesses it has recognized as the key to growth .
additionally , it wants to privatize the government 's current network of job placement agencies in order to create competition and increase efficiency . the party of democratic socialism the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communist regime , has established itself as a party of social justice and champion for the eastern german states . now , the party has extended its ideals to include the radical pacifist position recently abandoned by the green party and is calling itself the " peace and anti-war party . "
in that vein , it is calling for the dissolution of nato , instead placing responsibility for international security under the control of the united nations .
it also wants to reduce the german army from the current 340,000 to 100,000 soldiers and prohibit the sale of german weapons to other countries . as part of its family policy platform , the pds wants to raise the child allowance to 210 euro per child per month and to make daycare a legal right for all children up to the age of 14 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

however issues , including the role of german military still play a prominent role in all major parties . with more than four million unemployed and a stagnating economy , germany 's biggest parties are focusing on measures to spur growth and get people off the dole in the current election campaign . as germany counts the days to the federal elections on september 22 , the country 's six major political parties are busy stumping with their campaign platforms in an effort to win over undecided and swing voters . three major themes will be at the center of almost all every party platforms this year : the economy , employment and the social insurance system .
similar to the words of former us president bill clinton who once told a senior advisor : " it 's the economy , stupid ! " , german politicians have adopted the economy as the main issue in their election campaigns .
however , this year ’ s slogan is slightly different to clinton 's relatively moderate one ten years before .
today its more like " jobs , jobs , jobs ! " the spd one of the strongest features in this year ’ s election campaign , is the image of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- as protector of the public purse , with finance minister hans eichel as its strict treasurer .
" we 've abandoned the path of becoming a nation of debt and have made that our trademark , " the party 's election platform states .
the party is pledging to submit a balanced budget to parliament by 2006 .
through " solid financial policy , " the social democrats believe they can keep consumer prices stable , boost economic growth and create new jobs . in order to reduce german unemployment – at current more than four million - the spd is seeking to make low-pay jobs more attractive to employees and more affordable for employers .
the government wants to subsidize jobs with below-average low wages with payments between 325 and 800 euro in order to encourage the unemployed to take on what would otherwise be possibly unprofitable jobs . the spd has also pledged special federal job creation aid for germany ’ s eastern states , where unemployment is at a staggering 18 per cent .
the spd has said it will fund the new programs by setting " new priorities " and offering " more focused " social insurance benefits to people living in germany .
party strategists also hope to stretch the existing budget by merging the country 's unemployment and social welfare systems . families also play a central role in the social democrats ' party platform .
the party wants to introduce incremental increases of the german kindergeld , or child allowance , currently paid to families with children from the current 154 euro a month to 200 euro a month .
in the wake of criticism over germany 's dismal performance in the international pisa schools comparison study , the party also also wants to introduce more all-day schools across the country and initiate additional school reform initiatives .
it is prepared to spend 4 billion euro over the next four years to fulfill these ideas . the spd has also proposed reducing tax advantages currently enjoyed by married couples , instead providing them to single parents .
the party also wants to create programs encouraging companies to make more apprenticeships and training programs available , which are required in many vocations before a young person can be given a permanent job . cdu / csu for the first time in their 50-year history , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have come together to create a joint election platform .
citing the “ 40 ” as its magic september 22 number , the so-called union bloc 's priority is to attract a minimum of 40 per cent of voters and to cut to below 40 per cent of the highest tax rate , employment side costs for businesses and the country 's social insurance expenditures as well as the ratio of government expenditures to gross national product . like the spd , the union bloc also has its own proposal for the low-wage sector .
it wants to increase the current combination of low wages and subsidies from 325 euro a month to 400 .
like the spd , the union says combination-wage programs can be made possible by reducing government contributions to other social insurance programs , and that doing so will create new jobs . the union also says it will address the beleaguered eastern german economy with its own revitalization program .
if elected in september , the parties are proposing new laws that would accelerate investment in the sinking construction industry , make it easier for small firms to grow and do a better job of protecting industry in the east . the union also proposes increasing the budget of the bundeswehr , germany 's army .
it says the resource-strapped army , which has been stretched thin with close to 10,000 soldiers currently serving on foreign missions , is in bad need of more money in order to be capable of meeting its international defense obligations under nato and the united nations . the union differentiates itself from the current social democrat and greens-led government in three other key areas : it wants to amend laws currently on the books ordering the closure of all of germany 's nuclear power plants , increases in the country 's environment tax and the recently passed immigration law , which was approved under controversial circumstances in the country 's higher legislative chamber and now faces a federal constitutional court challenge . the greens in march , germany ’ s powerful left-wing party , the greens , voted to amend the uncompromising anti-war plank that had long topped its list of party principles .
however , by this time the party had already made the shift in practice - it was green leader joschka fischer and his party who co-authorized the first use of military force in germany ’ s post-war history , committing troops to nato ’ s 1999 bombing campaign in yugoslavia . in 2001 there followed the second authorization of the deployment of troops abroad , namely to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and in 2001 the third : 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom in the us-led " war on terror " .
the party also turned its back on radical pacifism and accepted the military presence of the united states in europe .
but it did so with an important condition : " the further reduction of our military potential must remain our goal . " this year , the party has set a goal of winning at least eight per cent of voters .
its election platform focuses on the environment , proposals to increase consumer protection and equality .
the greens also want to combine the country 's unemployment and social welfare benefits in order to create a unified safety net for all germans .
a special program within that infrastructure would be aimed at keeping families with children and , especially , single parents from slipping beneath the poverty level .
as it has in previous elections , the green party is also demanding a " society free of gender discrimination . " the free democrats the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has positioned itself as the business-friendly party of tax cuts .
one of its chief goals is to simplify germany 's byzantine tax-filing procedure and replace it with a one-page filing form similar to the 1040ez form which is used in the united states .
the party also wants to cut tax rates to 15 , 25 or 35 per cent based on income . other parties have dismissed the fdp 's lofty tax-cut pledges as implausible .
" ideas like that will sort themselves out very quickly , " said lothar späth , the former ceo of eastern german success story jenaoptik , now a senior political advisor to bavarian premier and opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber . the free democrats are setting their sights on the middle class with campaign slogans like " job machine no. 1 " and calls for leaner government .
education is another central theme in the fdp ’ s party platform .
the free democrats want to spur greater competition in the higher education sector by giving universities and technical colleges greater autonomy . in order to fuel job growth , the fdp wants to liberalize the country 's employment termination laws in order to make firing and , it hopes , hiring easier for the small-sized businesses it has recognized as the key to growth .
additionally , it wants to privatize the government 's current network of job placement agencies in order to create competition and increase efficiency . the party of democratic socialism the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communist regime , has established itself as a party of social justice and champion for the eastern german states . now , the party has extended its ideals to include the radical pacifist position recently abandoned by the green party and is calling itself the " peace and anti-war party . "
in that vein , it is calling for the dissolution of nato , instead placing responsibility for international security under the control of the united nations .
it also wants to reduce the german army from the current 340,000 to 100,000 soldiers and prohibit the sale of german weapons to other countries . as part of its family policy platform , the pds wants to raise the child allowance to 210 euro per child per month and to make daycare a legal right for all children up to the age of 14 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

today its more like " jobs , jobs , jobs ! " the spd one of the strongest features in this year ’ s election campaign , is the image of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- as protector of the public purse , with finance minister hans eichel as its strict treasurer .
" we 've abandoned the path of becoming a nation of debt and have made that our trademark , " the party 's election platform states .
the party is pledging to submit a balanced budget to parliament by 2006 .
through " solid financial policy , " the social democrats believe they can keep consumer prices stable , boost economic growth and create new jobs . in order to reduce german unemployment – at current more than four million - the spd is seeking to make low-pay jobs more attractive to employees and more affordable for employers .
the government wants to subsidize jobs with below-average low wages with payments between 325 and 800 euro in order to encourage the unemployed to take on what would otherwise be possibly unprofitable jobs . the spd has also pledged special federal job creation aid for germany ’ s eastern states , where unemployment is at a staggering 18 per cent .
the spd has said it will fund the new programs by setting " new priorities " and offering " more focused " social insurance benefits to people living in germany .
party strategists also hope to stretch the existing budget by merging the country 's unemployment and social welfare systems . families also play a central role in the social democrats ' party platform .
the party wants to introduce incremental increases of the german kindergeld , or child allowance , currently paid to families with children from the current 154 euro a month to 200 euro a month .
in the wake of criticism over germany 's dismal performance in the international pisa schools comparison study , the party also also wants to introduce more all-day schools across the country and initiate additional school reform initiatives .
it is prepared to spend 4 billion euro over the next four years to fulfill these ideas . the spd has also proposed reducing tax advantages currently enjoyed by married couples , instead providing them to single parents .
the party also wants to create programs encouraging companies to make more apprenticeships and training programs available , which are required in many vocations before a young person can be given a permanent job . cdu / csu for the first time in their 50-year history , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have come together to create a joint election platform .
citing the “ 40 ” as its magic september 22 number , the so-called union bloc 's priority is to attract a minimum of 40 per cent of voters and to cut to below 40 per cent of the highest tax rate , employment side costs for businesses and the country 's social insurance expenditures as well as the ratio of government expenditures to gross national product . like the spd , the union bloc also has its own proposal for the low-wage sector .
it wants to increase the current combination of low wages and subsidies from 325 euro a month to 400 .
like the spd , the union says combination-wage programs can be made possible by reducing government contributions to other social insurance programs , and that doing so will create new jobs . the union also says it will address the beleaguered eastern german economy with its own revitalization program .
if elected in september , the parties are proposing new laws that would accelerate investment in the sinking construction industry , make it easier for small firms to grow and do a better job of protecting industry in the east . the union also proposes increasing the budget of the bundeswehr , germany 's army .
it says the resource-strapped army , which has been stretched thin with close to 10,000 soldiers currently serving on foreign missions , is in bad need of more money in order to be capable of meeting its international defense obligations under nato and the united nations . the union differentiates itself from the current social democrat and greens-led government in three other key areas : it wants to amend laws currently on the books ordering the closure of all of germany 's nuclear power plants , increases in the country 's environment tax and the recently passed immigration law , which was approved under controversial circumstances in the country 's higher legislative chamber and now faces a federal constitutional court challenge . the greens in march , germany ’ s powerful left-wing party , the greens , voted to amend the uncompromising anti-war plank that had long topped its list of party principles .
however , by this time the party had already made the shift in practice - it was green leader joschka fischer and his party who co-authorized the first use of military force in germany ’ s post-war history , committing troops to nato ’ s 1999 bombing campaign in yugoslavia . in 2001 there followed the second authorization of the deployment of troops abroad , namely to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and in 2001 the third : 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom in the us-led " war on terror " .
the party also turned its back on radical pacifism and accepted the military presence of the united states in europe .
but it did so with an important condition : " the further reduction of our military potential must remain our goal . " this year , the party has set a goal of winning at least eight per cent of voters .
its election platform focuses on the environment , proposals to increase consumer protection and equality .
the greens also want to combine the country 's unemployment and social welfare benefits in order to create a unified safety net for all germans .
a special program within that infrastructure would be aimed at keeping families with children and , especially , single parents from slipping beneath the poverty level .
as it has in previous elections , the green party is also demanding a " society free of gender discrimination . " the free democrats the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has positioned itself as the business-friendly party of tax cuts .
one of its chief goals is to simplify germany 's byzantine tax-filing procedure and replace it with a one-page filing form similar to the 1040ez form which is used in the united states .
the party also wants to cut tax rates to 15 , 25 or 35 per cent based on income . other parties have dismissed the fdp 's lofty tax-cut pledges as implausible .
" ideas like that will sort themselves out very quickly , " said lothar späth , the former ceo of eastern german success story jenaoptik , now a senior political advisor to bavarian premier and opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber . the free democrats are setting their sights on the middle class with campaign slogans like " job machine no. 1 " and calls for leaner government .
education is another central theme in the fdp ’ s party platform .
the free democrats want to spur greater competition in the higher education sector by giving universities and technical colleges greater autonomy . in order to fuel job growth , the fdp wants to liberalize the country 's employment termination laws in order to make firing and , it hopes , hiring easier for the small-sized businesses it has recognized as the key to growth .
additionally , it wants to privatize the government 's current network of job placement agencies in order to create competition and increase efficiency . the party of democratic socialism the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communist regime , has established itself as a party of social justice and champion for the eastern german states . now , the party has extended its ideals to include the radical pacifist position recently abandoned by the green party and is calling itself the " peace and anti-war party . "
in that vein , it is calling for the dissolution of nato , instead placing responsibility for international security under the control of the united nations .
it also wants to reduce the german army from the current 340,000 to 100,000 soldiers and prohibit the sale of german weapons to other countries . as part of its family policy platform , the pds wants to raise the child allowance to 210 euro per child per month and to make daycare a legal right for all children up to the age of 14 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

the party wants to introduce incremental increases of the german kindergeld , or child allowance , currently paid to families with children from the current 154 euro a month to 200 euro a month .
in the wake of criticism over germany 's dismal performance in the international pisa schools comparison study , the party also also wants to introduce more all-day schools across the country and initiate additional school reform initiatives .
it is prepared to spend 4 billion euro over the next four years to fulfill these ideas . the spd has also proposed reducing tax advantages currently enjoyed by married couples , instead providing them to single parents .
the party also wants to create programs encouraging companies to make more apprenticeships and training programs available , which are required in many vocations before a young person can be given a permanent job . cdu / csu for the first time in their 50-year history , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have come together to create a joint election platform .
citing the “ 40 ” as its magic september 22 number , the so-called union bloc 's priority is to attract a minimum of 40 per cent of voters and to cut to below 40 per cent of the highest tax rate , employment side costs for businesses and the country 's social insurance expenditures as well as the ratio of government expenditures to gross national product . like the spd , the union bloc also has its own proposal for the low-wage sector .
it wants to increase the current combination of low wages and subsidies from 325 euro a month to 400 .
like the spd , the union says combination-wage programs can be made possible by reducing government contributions to other social insurance programs , and that doing so will create new jobs . the union also says it will address the beleaguered eastern german economy with its own revitalization program .
if elected in september , the parties are proposing new laws that would accelerate investment in the sinking construction industry , make it easier for small firms to grow and do a better job of protecting industry in the east . the union also proposes increasing the budget of the bundeswehr , germany 's army .
it says the resource-strapped army , which has been stretched thin with close to 10,000 soldiers currently serving on foreign missions , is in bad need of more money in order to be capable of meeting its international defense obligations under nato and the united nations . the union differentiates itself from the current social democrat and greens-led government in three other key areas : it wants to amend laws currently on the books ordering the closure of all of germany 's nuclear power plants , increases in the country 's environment tax and the recently passed immigration law , which was approved under controversial circumstances in the country 's higher legislative chamber and now faces a federal constitutional court challenge . the greens in march , germany ’ s powerful left-wing party , the greens , voted to amend the uncompromising anti-war plank that had long topped its list of party principles .
however , by this time the party had already made the shift in practice - it was green leader joschka fischer and his party who co-authorized the first use of military force in germany ’ s post-war history , committing troops to nato ’ s 1999 bombing campaign in yugoslavia . in 2001 there followed the second authorization of the deployment of troops abroad , namely to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and in 2001 the third : 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom in the us-led " war on terror " .
the party also turned its back on radical pacifism and accepted the military presence of the united states in europe .
but it did so with an important condition : " the further reduction of our military potential must remain our goal . " this year , the party has set a goal of winning at least eight per cent of voters .
its election platform focuses on the environment , proposals to increase consumer protection and equality .
the greens also want to combine the country 's unemployment and social welfare benefits in order to create a unified safety net for all germans .
a special program within that infrastructure would be aimed at keeping families with children and , especially , single parents from slipping beneath the poverty level .
as it has in previous elections , the green party is also demanding a " society free of gender discrimination . " the free democrats the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has positioned itself as the business-friendly party of tax cuts .
one of its chief goals is to simplify germany 's byzantine tax-filing procedure and replace it with a one-page filing form similar to the 1040ez form which is used in the united states .
the party also wants to cut tax rates to 15 , 25 or 35 per cent based on income . other parties have dismissed the fdp 's lofty tax-cut pledges as implausible .
" ideas like that will sort themselves out very quickly , " said lothar späth , the former ceo of eastern german success story jenaoptik , now a senior political advisor to bavarian premier and opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber . the free democrats are setting their sights on the middle class with campaign slogans like " job machine no. 1 " and calls for leaner government .
education is another central theme in the fdp ’ s party platform .
the free democrats want to spur greater competition in the higher education sector by giving universities and technical colleges greater autonomy . in order to fuel job growth , the fdp wants to liberalize the country 's employment termination laws in order to make firing and , it hopes , hiring easier for the small-sized businesses it has recognized as the key to growth .
additionally , it wants to privatize the government 's current network of job placement agencies in order to create competition and increase efficiency . the party of democratic socialism the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communist regime , has established itself as a party of social justice and champion for the eastern german states . now , the party has extended its ideals to include the radical pacifist position recently abandoned by the green party and is calling itself the " peace and anti-war party . "
in that vein , it is calling for the dissolution of nato , instead placing responsibility for international security under the control of the united nations .
it also wants to reduce the german army from the current 340,000 to 100,000 soldiers and prohibit the sale of german weapons to other countries . as part of its family policy platform , the pds wants to raise the child allowance to 210 euro per child per month and to make daycare a legal right for all children up to the age of 14 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

it wants to increase the current combination of low wages and subsidies from 325 euro a month to 400 .
like the spd , the union says combination-wage programs can be made possible by reducing government contributions to other social insurance programs , and that doing so will create new jobs . the union also says it will address the beleaguered eastern german economy with its own revitalization program .
if elected in september , the parties are proposing new laws that would accelerate investment in the sinking construction industry , make it easier for small firms to grow and do a better job of protecting industry in the east . the union also proposes increasing the budget of the bundeswehr , germany 's army .
it says the resource-strapped army , which has been stretched thin with close to 10,000 soldiers currently serving on foreign missions , is in bad need of more money in order to be capable of meeting its international defense obligations under nato and the united nations . the union differentiates itself from the current social democrat and greens-led government in three other key areas : it wants to amend laws currently on the books ordering the closure of all of germany 's nuclear power plants , increases in the country 's environment tax and the recently passed immigration law , which was approved under controversial circumstances in the country 's higher legislative chamber and now faces a federal constitutional court challenge . the greens in march , germany ’ s powerful left-wing party , the greens , voted to amend the uncompromising anti-war plank that had long topped its list of party principles .
however , by this time the party had already made the shift in practice - it was green leader joschka fischer and his party who co-authorized the first use of military force in germany ’ s post-war history , committing troops to nato ’ s 1999 bombing campaign in yugoslavia . in 2001 there followed the second authorization of the deployment of troops abroad , namely to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and in 2001 the third : 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom in the us-led " war on terror " .
the party also turned its back on radical pacifism and accepted the military presence of the united states in europe .
but it did so with an important condition : " the further reduction of our military potential must remain our goal . " this year , the party has set a goal of winning at least eight per cent of voters .
its election platform focuses on the environment , proposals to increase consumer protection and equality .
the greens also want to combine the country 's unemployment and social welfare benefits in order to create a unified safety net for all germans .
a special program within that infrastructure would be aimed at keeping families with children and , especially , single parents from slipping beneath the poverty level .
as it has in previous elections , the green party is also demanding a " society free of gender discrimination . " the free democrats the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has positioned itself as the business-friendly party of tax cuts .
one of its chief goals is to simplify germany 's byzantine tax-filing procedure and replace it with a one-page filing form similar to the 1040ez form which is used in the united states .
the party also wants to cut tax rates to 15 , 25 or 35 per cent based on income . other parties have dismissed the fdp 's lofty tax-cut pledges as implausible .

education is another central theme in the fdp ’ s party platform .
the free democrats want to spur greater competition in the higher education sector by giving universities and technical colleges greater autonomy . in order to fuel job growth , the fdp wants to liberalize the country 's employment termination laws in order to make firing and , it hopes , hiring easier for the small-sized businesses it has recognized as the key to growth .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lack in jobs for young people is a sticking point in this year 's election campaign the main issue in this year 's federal election will be germany 's stagnating economy .
however issues , including the role of german military still play a prominent role in all major parties . with more than four million unemployed and a stagnating economy , germany 's biggest parties are focusing on measures to spur growth and get people off the dole in the current election campaign . as germany counts the days to the federal elections on september 22 , the country 's six major political parties are busy stumping with their campaign platforms in an effort to win over undecided and swing voters . three major themes will be at the center of almost all every party platforms this year : the economy , employment and the social insurance system .
similar to the words of former us president bill clinton who once told a senior advisor : " it 's the economy , stupid ! " , german politicians have adopted the economy as the main issue in their election campaigns .
however , this year ’ s slogan is slightly different to clinton 's relatively moderate one ten years before .
today its more like " jobs , jobs , jobs ! " the spd one of the strongest features in this year ’ s election campaign , is the image of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- as protector of the public purse , with finance minister hans eichel as its strict treasurer .
" we 've abandoned the path of becoming a nation of debt and have made that our trademark , " the party 's election platform states .
the party is pledging to submit a balanced budget to parliament by 2006 .
through " solid financial policy , " the social democrats believe they can keep consumer prices stable , boost economic growth and create new jobs . in order to reduce german unemployment – at current more than four million - the spd is seeking to make low-pay jobs more attractive to employees and more affordable for employers .
the government wants to subsidize jobs with below-average low wages with payments between 325 and 800 euro in order to encourage the unemployed to take on what would otherwise be possibly unprofitable jobs . the spd has also pledged special federal job creation aid for germany ’ s eastern states , where unemployment is at a staggering 18 per cent .
the spd has said it will fund the new programs by setting " new priorities " and offering " more focused " social insurance benefits to people living in germany .
party strategists also hope to stretch the existing budget by merging the country 's unemployment and social welfare systems . families also play a central role in the social democrats ' party platform .
the party wants to introduce incremental increases of the german kindergeld , or child allowance , currently paid to families with children from the current 154 euro a month to 200 euro a month .
in the wake of criticism over germany 's dismal performance in the international pisa schools comparison study , the party also also wants to introduce more all-day schools across the country and initiate additional school reform initiatives .
it is prepared to spend 4 billion euro over the next four years to fulfill these ideas . the spd has also proposed reducing tax advantages currently enjoyed by married couples , instead providing them to single parents .

it says the resource-strapped army , which has been stretched thin with close to 10,000 soldiers currently serving on foreign missions , is in bad need of more money in order to be capable of meeting its international defense obligations under nato and the united nations . the union differentiates itself from the current social democrat and greens-led government in three other key areas : it wants to amend laws currently on the books ordering the closure of all of germany 's nuclear power plants , increases in the country 's environment tax and the recently passed immigration law , which was approved under controversial circumstances in the country 's higher legislative chamber and now faces a federal constitutional court challenge . the greens in march , germany ’ s powerful left-wing party , the greens , voted to amend the uncompromising anti-war plank that had long topped its list of party principles .
however , by this time the party had already made the shift in practice - it was green leader joschka fischer and his party who co-authorized the first use of military force in germany ’ s post-war history , committing troops to nato ’ s 1999 bombing campaign in yugoslavia . in 2001 there followed the second authorization of the deployment of troops abroad , namely to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and in 2001 the third : 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom in the us-led " war on terror " .
the party also turned its back on radical pacifism and accepted the military presence of the united states in europe .
but it did so with an important condition : " the further reduction of our military potential must remain our goal . " this year , the party has set a goal of winning at least eight per cent of voters .
its election platform focuses on the environment , proposals to increase consumer protection and equality .
the greens also want to combine the country 's unemployment and social welfare benefits in order to create a unified safety net for all germans .
a special program within that infrastructure would be aimed at keeping families with children and , especially , single parents from slipping beneath the poverty level .
as it has in previous elections , the green party is also demanding a " society free of gender discrimination . " the free democrats the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has positioned itself as the business-friendly party of tax cuts .
one of its chief goals is to simplify germany 's byzantine tax-filing procedure and replace it with a one-page filing form similar to the 1040ez form which is used in the united states .
the party also wants to cut tax rates to 15 , 25 or 35 per cent based on income . other parties have dismissed the fdp 's lofty tax-cut pledges as implausible .
" ideas like that will sort themselves out very quickly , " said lothar späth , the former ceo of eastern german success story jenaoptik , now a senior political advisor to bavarian premier and opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber . the free democrats are setting their sights on the middle class with campaign slogans like " job machine no. 1 " and calls for leaner government .
education is another central theme in the fdp ’ s party platform .
the free democrats want to spur greater competition in the higher education sector by giving universities and technical colleges greater autonomy . in order to fuel job growth , the fdp wants to liberalize the country 's employment termination laws in order to make firing and , it hopes , hiring easier for the small-sized businesses it has recognized as the key to growth .
additionally , it wants to privatize the government 's current network of job placement agencies in order to create competition and increase efficiency . the party of democratic socialism the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communist regime , has established itself as a party of social justice and champion for the eastern german states . now , the party has extended its ideals to include the radical pacifist position recently abandoned by the green party and is calling itself the " peace and anti-war party . "
in that vein , it is calling for the dissolution of nato , instead placing responsibility for international security under the control of the united nations .
it also wants to reduce the german army from the current 340,000 to 100,000 soldiers and prohibit the sale of german weapons to other countries . as part of its family policy platform , the pds wants to raise the child allowance to 210 euro per child per month and to make daycare a legal right for all children up to the age of 14 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

but many insurers are struggling to remain afloat while paying out their holders ’ policies . after suffering through nearly a week of torrential downpours and record-breaking floods , germany and europe are just starting to clean up and calculate the damages .
everywhere one looks , the heavy rainfall and unseasonable storms have left a trail of chaos and destruction .
both private and public property has been ruined , agricultural land has been destroyed , and the infrastructure in large parts of europe has come to a standstill .
" the full extent of damage is not yet definable , " said manfred goedecke , director of the german chambers of industry and commerce , to reporters on wednesday .
the losses are incalculable for households and businesses in the regions most hardest hit .
and of course the damage also effects the insurance industry , which suddenly sees itself forced to pay out large sums of money to policy holders at a time when the industry itself is treading water .
uncertain cost forecasts allianz and many other insurers in europe are reluctant to say how much the recent weather catastrophe will cost them in the end .
but with thousands of households and businesses effected by the flooding , the list of damages is likely to be long , and the claims on the insurance companies high .
" it ’ s too early for an accurate estimate of costs , " helmut perlet , board member of germany ’ s largest insurer allianz , told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" we ’ re still busy cleaning up , " and therefore the dimensions can ’ t yet be calculated .
the federal association of german insurers echoes this thinking , saying " at the time , we can ’ t get a clear overview of how high the claims ’ costs will be . "
but what ’ s certain is that the financial consequences of the flooding will be extensive and exceed the amount insurance companies paid out in earlier years for similar flood and storm coverage .
" the year 2002 will diverge significantly from the long-term average in terms of flood and storm damage claims , " said arno junke , director of germany ’ s branch for general cologne re , the world ’ s third largest re-insurer .
and according to allianz , the amount of damages caused by bad weather has increased fourfold just in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year .
unusual weather leads to unusually high costs weather has always played a role in insurance policy coverage .
one need only think of the annual flooding of the rhine .
but the recent series of natural catastrophes has been more extreme , say industry experts .
" what ’ s new about the newest wave of bad weather is the considerable frequency with which storms and floods have left severe damage behind .
there were always large single catastrophes like hurricane lothar in 1999 .
but now the insurance industry has to deal with an unusually high number of catastrophes with excessive damages , " junke explained .
trouble on the horizon for insurers ?
if the meteorological and industry forecasts hold true and more bad weather strikes europe more often , insurers may find themselves struggling to stay above water .
in the long-term , industry analysts say financially-strapped companies could have difficulty coming up with the cash necessary to pay policy holders filing claims for flood and storm coverage .
" the insurance industry won ’ t be able to shoulder everything , " junke predicts .
this could especially be the case for small insurers suffering from liquidity problems .
large insurance companies such as allianz have faired the storm fairly well , but they too are facing increasing pressure to sell off devalued stocks to cover mounting policy claims .
at the moment allianz says it does not need to readjust its expected yearly gains , however , much is riding on whether or not fall and winter turn out to be stormy seasons .
in this regard , both the insurers and the meteorologists seem to be playing the same game : let ’ s wait and see .
as for an increase in premium costs , insurance experts have said that it ’ s still too early for any clear statements and that only a long-term series of catastrophes would prompt that .

the losses are incalculable for households and businesses in the regions most hardest hit .
and of course the damage also effects the insurance industry , which suddenly sees itself forced to pay out large sums of money to policy holders at a time when the industry itself is treading water .
uncertain cost forecasts allianz and many other insurers in europe are reluctant to say how much the recent weather catastrophe will cost them in the end .
but with thousands of households and businesses effected by the flooding , the list of damages is likely to be long , and the claims on the insurance companies high .
" it ’ s too early for an accurate estimate of costs , " helmut perlet , board member of germany ’ s largest insurer allianz , told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" we ’ re still busy cleaning up , " and therefore the dimensions can ’ t yet be calculated .
the federal association of german insurers echoes this thinking , saying " at the time , we can ’ t get a clear overview of how high the claims ’ costs will be . "
but what ’ s certain is that the financial consequences of the flooding will be extensive and exceed the amount insurance companies paid out in earlier years for similar flood and storm coverage .
" the year 2002 will diverge significantly from the long-term average in terms of flood and storm damage claims , " said arno junke , director of germany ’ s branch for general cologne re , the world ’ s third largest re-insurer .
and according to allianz , the amount of damages caused by bad weather has increased fourfold just in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year .
unusual weather leads to unusually high costs weather has always played a role in insurance policy coverage .
one need only think of the annual flooding of the rhine .
but the recent series of natural catastrophes has been more extreme , say industry experts .
" what ’ s new about the newest wave of bad weather is the considerable frequency with which storms and floods have left severe damage behind .
there were always large single catastrophes like hurricane lothar in 1999 .
but now the insurance industry has to deal with an unusually high number of catastrophes with excessive damages , " junke explained .
trouble on the horizon for insurers ?
if the meteorological and industry forecasts hold true and more bad weather strikes europe more often , insurers may find themselves struggling to stay above water .
in the long-term , industry analysts say financially-strapped companies could have difficulty coming up with the cash necessary to pay policy holders filing claims for flood and storm coverage .
" the insurance industry won ’ t be able to shoulder everything , " junke predicts .
this could especially be the case for small insurers suffering from liquidity problems .
large insurance companies such as allianz have faired the storm fairly well , but they too are facing increasing pressure to sell off devalued stocks to cover mounting policy claims .
at the moment allianz says it does not need to readjust its expected yearly gains , however , much is riding on whether or not fall and winter turn out to be stormy seasons .
in this regard , both the insurers and the meteorologists seem to be playing the same game : let ’ s wait and see .
as for an increase in premium costs , insurance experts have said that it ’ s still too early for any clear statements and that only a long-term series of catastrophes would prompt that .

uncertain cost forecasts allianz and many other insurers in europe are reluctant to say how much the recent weather catastrophe will cost them in the end .

trouble on the horizon for insurers ?
if the meteorological and industry forecasts hold true and more bad weather strikes europe more often , insurers may find themselves struggling to stay above water .
in the long-term , industry analysts say financially-strapped companies could have difficulty coming up with the cash necessary to pay policy holders filing claims for flood and storm coverage .
" the insurance industry won ’ t be able to shoulder everything , " junke predicts .
this could especially be the case for small insurers suffering from liquidity problems .
large insurance companies such as allianz have faired the storm fairly well , but they too are facing increasing pressure to sell off devalued stocks to cover mounting policy claims .
at the moment allianz says it does not need to readjust its expected yearly gains , however , much is riding on whether or not fall and winter turn out to be stormy seasons .
in this regard , both the insurers and the meteorologists seem to be playing the same game : let ’ s wait and see .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lack in jobs for young people is a sticking point in this year 's election campaign the main issue in this year 's federal election will be germany 's stagnating economy .
however issues , including the role of german military still play a prominent role in all major parties . with more than four million unemployed and a stagnating economy , germany 's biggest parties are focusing on measures to spur growth and get people off the dole in the current election campaign . as germany counts the days to the federal elections on september 22 , the country 's six major political parties are busy stumping with their campaign platforms in an effort to win over undecided and swing voters . three major themes will be at the center of almost all every party platforms this year : the economy , employment and the social insurance system .
similar to the words of former us president bill clinton who once told a senior advisor : " it 's the economy , stupid ! " , german politicians have adopted the economy as the main issue in their election campaigns .
however , this year ’ s slogan is slightly different to clinton 's relatively moderate one ten years before .
today its more like " jobs , jobs , jobs ! " the spd one of the strongest features in this year ’ s election campaign , is the image of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- as protector of the public purse , with finance minister hans eichel as its strict treasurer .
" we 've abandoned the path of becoming a nation of debt and have made that our trademark , " the party 's election platform states .
the party is pledging to submit a balanced budget to parliament by 2006 .
through " solid financial policy , " the social democrats believe they can keep consumer prices stable , boost economic growth and create new jobs . in order to reduce german unemployment – at current more than four million - the spd is seeking to make low-pay jobs more attractive to employees and more affordable for employers .
the government wants to subsidize jobs with below-average low wages with payments between 325 and 800 euro in order to encourage the unemployed to take on what would otherwise be possibly unprofitable jobs . the spd has also pledged special federal job creation aid for germany ’ s eastern states , where unemployment is at a staggering 18 per cent .
the spd has said it will fund the new programs by setting " new priorities " and offering " more focused " social insurance benefits to people living in germany .
party strategists also hope to stretch the existing budget by merging the country 's unemployment and social welfare systems . families also play a central role in the social democrats ' party platform .
the party wants to introduce incremental increases of the german kindergeld , or child allowance , currently paid to families with children from the current 154 euro a month to 200 euro a month .
in the wake of criticism over germany 's dismal performance in the international pisa schools comparison study , the party also also wants to introduce more all-day schools across the country and initiate additional school reform initiatives .
it is prepared to spend 4 billion euro over the next four years to fulfill these ideas . the spd has also proposed reducing tax advantages currently enjoyed by married couples , instead providing them to single parents .
the party also wants to create programs encouraging companies to make more apprenticeships and training programs available , which are required in many vocations before a young person can be given a permanent job . cdu / csu for the first time in their 50-year history , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have come together to create a joint election platform .
citing the “ 40 ” as its magic september 22 number , the so-called union bloc 's priority is to attract a minimum of 40 per cent of voters and to cut to below 40 per cent of the highest tax rate , employment side costs for businesses and the country 's social insurance expenditures as well as the ratio of government expenditures to gross national product . like the spd , the union bloc also has its own proposal for the low-wage sector .
it wants to increase the current combination of low wages and subsidies from 325 euro a month to 400 .
like the spd , the union says combination-wage programs can be made possible by reducing government contributions to other social insurance programs , and that doing so will create new jobs . the union also says it will address the beleaguered eastern german economy with its own revitalization program .
if elected in september , the parties are proposing new laws that would accelerate investment in the sinking construction industry , make it easier for small firms to grow and do a better job of protecting industry in the east . the union also proposes increasing the budget of the bundeswehr , germany 's army .
it says the resource-strapped army , which has been stretched thin with close to 10,000 soldiers currently serving on foreign missions , is in bad need of more money in order to be capable of meeting its international defense obligations under nato and the united nations . the union differentiates itself from the current social democrat and greens-led government in three other key areas : it wants to amend laws currently on the books ordering the closure of all of germany 's nuclear power plants , increases in the country 's environment tax and the recently passed immigration law , which was approved under controversial circumstances in the country 's higher legislative chamber and now faces a federal constitutional court challenge . the greens in march , germany ’ s powerful left-wing party , the greens , voted to amend the uncompromising anti-war plank that had long topped its list of party principles .
however , by this time the party had already made the shift in practice - it was green leader joschka fischer and his party who co-authorized the first use of military force in germany ’ s post-war history , committing troops to nato ’ s 1999 bombing campaign in yugoslavia . in 2001 there followed the second authorization of the deployment of troops abroad , namely to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and in 2001 the third : 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom in the us-led " war on terror " .
the party also turned its back on radical pacifism and accepted the military presence of the united states in europe .
but it did so with an important condition : " the further reduction of our military potential must remain our goal . " this year , the party has set a goal of winning at least eight per cent of voters .
its election platform focuses on the environment , proposals to increase consumer protection and equality .
the greens also want to combine the country 's unemployment and social welfare benefits in order to create a unified safety net for all germans .
a special program within that infrastructure would be aimed at keeping families with children and , especially , single parents from slipping beneath the poverty level .
as it has in previous elections , the green party is also demanding a " society free of gender discrimination . " the free democrats the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has positioned itself as the business-friendly party of tax cuts .
one of its chief goals is to simplify germany 's byzantine tax-filing procedure and replace it with a one-page filing form similar to the 1040ez form which is used in the united states .
the party also wants to cut tax rates to 15 , 25 or 35 per cent based on income . other parties have dismissed the fdp 's lofty tax-cut pledges as implausible .
" ideas like that will sort themselves out very quickly , " said lothar späth , the former ceo of eastern german success story jenaoptik , now a senior political advisor to bavarian premier and opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber . the free democrats are setting their sights on the middle class with campaign slogans like " job machine no. 1 " and calls for leaner government .
education is another central theme in the fdp ’ s party platform .
the free democrats want to spur greater competition in the higher education sector by giving universities and technical colleges greater autonomy . in order to fuel job growth , the fdp wants to liberalize the country 's employment termination laws in order to make firing and , it hopes , hiring easier for the small-sized businesses it has recognized as the key to growth .
additionally , it wants to privatize the government 's current network of job placement agencies in order to create competition and increase efficiency . the party of democratic socialism the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communist regime , has established itself as a party of social justice and champion for the eastern german states . now , the party has extended its ideals to include the radical pacifist position recently abandoned by the green party and is calling itself the " peace and anti-war party . "
in that vein , it is calling for the dissolution of nato , instead placing responsibility for international security under the control of the united nations .
it also wants to reduce the german army from the current 340,000 to 100,000 soldiers and prohibit the sale of german weapons to other countries . as part of its family policy platform , the pds wants to raise the child allowance to 210 euro per child per month and to make daycare a legal right for all children up to the age of 14 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 picture of the day chancellor merkel angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor " kohl 's girl " makes good chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

citing the “ 40 ” as its magic september 22 number , the so-called union bloc 's priority is to attract a minimum of 40 per cent of voters and to cut to below 40 per cent of the highest tax rate , employment side costs for businesses and the country 's social insurance expenditures as well as the ratio of government expenditures to gross national product . like the spd , the union bloc also has its own proposal for the low-wage sector .
it wants to increase the current combination of low wages and subsidies from 325 euro a month to 400 .
like the spd , the union says combination-wage programs can be made possible by reducing government contributions to other social insurance programs , and that doing so will create new jobs . the union also says it will address the beleaguered eastern german economy with its own revitalization program .
if elected in september , the parties are proposing new laws that would accelerate investment in the sinking construction industry , make it easier for small firms to grow and do a better job of protecting industry in the east . the union also proposes increasing the budget of the bundeswehr , germany 's army .
it says the resource-strapped army , which has been stretched thin with close to 10,000 soldiers currently serving on foreign missions , is in bad need of more money in order to be capable of meeting its international defense obligations under nato and the united nations . the union differentiates itself from the current social democrat and greens-led government in three other key areas : it wants to amend laws currently on the books ordering the closure of all of germany 's nuclear power plants , increases in the country 's environment tax and the recently passed immigration law , which was approved under controversial circumstances in the country 's higher legislative chamber and now faces a federal constitutional court challenge . the greens in march , germany ’ s powerful left-wing party , the greens , voted to amend the uncompromising anti-war plank that had long topped its list of party principles .
however , by this time the party had already made the shift in practice - it was green leader joschka fischer and his party who co-authorized the first use of military force in germany ’ s post-war history , committing troops to nato ’ s 1999 bombing campaign in yugoslavia . in 2001 there followed the second authorization of the deployment of troops abroad , namely to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and in 2001 the third : 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom in the us-led " war on terror " .
the party also turned its back on radical pacifism and accepted the military presence of the united states in europe .
but it did so with an important condition : " the further reduction of our military potential must remain our goal . " this year , the party has set a goal of winning at least eight per cent of voters .
its election platform focuses on the environment , proposals to increase consumer protection and equality .
the greens also want to combine the country 's unemployment and social welfare benefits in order to create a unified safety net for all germans .
a special program within that infrastructure would be aimed at keeping families with children and , especially , single parents from slipping beneath the poverty level .
as it has in previous elections , the green party is also demanding a " society free of gender discrimination . " the free democrats the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has positioned itself as the business-friendly party of tax cuts .
one of its chief goals is to simplify germany 's byzantine tax-filing procedure and replace it with a one-page filing form similar to the 1040ez form which is used in the united states .
the party also wants to cut tax rates to 15 , 25 or 35 per cent based on income . other parties have dismissed the fdp 's lofty tax-cut pledges as implausible .
" ideas like that will sort themselves out very quickly , " said lothar späth , the former ceo of eastern german success story jenaoptik , now a senior political advisor to bavarian premier and opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber . the free democrats are setting their sights on the middle class with campaign slogans like " job machine no. 1 " and calls for leaner government .
education is another central theme in the fdp ’ s party platform .
the free democrats want to spur greater competition in the higher education sector by giving universities and technical colleges greater autonomy . in order to fuel job growth , the fdp wants to liberalize the country 's employment termination laws in order to make firing and , it hopes , hiring easier for the small-sized businesses it has recognized as the key to growth .
additionally , it wants to privatize the government 's current network of job placement agencies in order to create competition and increase efficiency . the party of democratic socialism the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communist regime , has established itself as a party of social justice and champion for the eastern german states . now , the party has extended its ideals to include the radical pacifist position recently abandoned by the green party and is calling itself the " peace and anti-war party .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lack in jobs for young people is a sticking point in this year 's election campaign the main issue in this year 's federal election will be germany 's stagnating economy .
however issues , including the role of german military still play a prominent role in all major parties . with more than four million unemployed and a stagnating economy , germany 's biggest parties are focusing on measures to spur growth and get people off the dole in the current election campaign . as germany counts the days to the federal elections on september 22 , the country 's six major political parties are busy stumping with their campaign platforms in an effort to win over undecided and swing voters . three major themes will be at the center of almost all every party platforms this year : the economy , employment and the social insurance system .
similar to the words of former us president bill clinton who once told a senior advisor : " it 's the economy , stupid ! " , german politicians have adopted the economy as the main issue in their election campaigns .
however , this year ’ s slogan is slightly different to clinton 's relatively moderate one ten years before .
today its more like " jobs , jobs , jobs ! " the spd one of the strongest features in this year ’ s election campaign , is the image of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- as protector of the public purse , with finance minister hans eichel as its strict treasurer .
" we 've abandoned the path of becoming a nation of debt and have made that our trademark , " the party 's election platform states .
the party is pledging to submit a balanced budget to parliament by 2006 .
through " solid financial policy , " the social democrats believe they can keep consumer prices stable , boost economic growth and create new jobs . in order to reduce german unemployment – at current more than four million - the spd is seeking to make low-pay jobs more attractive to employees and more affordable for employers .
the government wants to subsidize jobs with below-average low wages with payments between 325 and 800 euro in order to encourage the unemployed to take on what would otherwise be possibly unprofitable jobs . the spd has also pledged special federal job creation aid for germany ’ s eastern states , where unemployment is at a staggering 18 per cent .
the spd has said it will fund the new programs by setting " new priorities " and offering " more focused " social insurance benefits to people living in germany .
party strategists also hope to stretch the existing budget by merging the country 's unemployment and social welfare systems . families also play a central role in the social democrats ' party platform .
the party wants to introduce incremental increases of the german kindergeld , or child allowance , currently paid to families with children from the current 154 euro a month to 200 euro a month .
in the wake of criticism over germany 's dismal performance in the international pisa schools comparison study , the party also also wants to introduce more all-day schools across the country and initiate additional school reform initiatives .
it is prepared to spend 4 billion euro over the next four years to fulfill these ideas . the spd has also proposed reducing tax advantages currently enjoyed by married couples , instead providing them to single parents .

it says the resource-strapped army , which has been stretched thin with close to 10,000 soldiers currently serving on foreign missions , is in bad need of more money in order to be capable of meeting its international defense obligations under nato and the united nations . the union differentiates itself from the current social democrat and greens-led government in three other key areas : it wants to amend laws currently on the books ordering the closure of all of germany 's nuclear power plants , increases in the country 's environment tax and the recently passed immigration law , which was approved under controversial circumstances in the country 's higher legislative chamber and now faces a federal constitutional court challenge . the greens in march , germany ’ s powerful left-wing party , the greens , voted to amend the uncompromising anti-war plank that had long topped its list of party principles .
however , by this time the party had already made the shift in practice - it was green leader joschka fischer and his party who co-authorized the first use of military force in germany ’ s post-war history , committing troops to nato ’ s 1999 bombing campaign in yugoslavia . in 2001 there followed the second authorization of the deployment of troops abroad , namely to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and in 2001 the third : 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom in the us-led " war on terror " .
the party also turned its back on radical pacifism and accepted the military presence of the united states in europe .
but it did so with an important condition : " the further reduction of our military potential must remain our goal . " this year , the party has set a goal of winning at least eight per cent of voters .
its election platform focuses on the environment , proposals to increase consumer protection and equality .
the greens also want to combine the country 's unemployment and social welfare benefits in order to create a unified safety net for all germans .
a special program within that infrastructure would be aimed at keeping families with children and , especially , single parents from slipping beneath the poverty level .
as it has in previous elections , the green party is also demanding a " society free of gender discrimination . " the free democrats the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has positioned itself as the business-friendly party of tax cuts .
one of its chief goals is to simplify germany 's byzantine tax-filing procedure and replace it with a one-page filing form similar to the 1040ez form which is used in the united states .
the party also wants to cut tax rates to 15 , 25 or 35 per cent based on income . other parties have dismissed the fdp 's lofty tax-cut pledges as implausible .

education is another central theme in the fdp ’ s party platform .
the free democrats want to spur greater competition in the higher education sector by giving universities and technical colleges greater autonomy . in order to fuel job growth , the fdp wants to liberalize the country 's employment termination laws in order to make firing and , it hopes , hiring easier for the small-sized businesses it has recognized as the key to growth .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lack in jobs for young people is a sticking point in this year 's election campaign the main issue in this year 's federal election will be germany 's stagnating economy .
however issues , including the role of german military still play a prominent role in all major parties . with more than four million unemployed and a stagnating economy , germany 's biggest parties are focusing on measures to spur growth and get people off the dole in the current election campaign . as germany counts the days to the federal elections on september 22 , the country 's six major political parties are busy stumping with their campaign platforms in an effort to win over undecided and swing voters . three major themes will be at the center of almost all every party platforms this year : the economy , employment and the social insurance system .
similar to the words of former us president bill clinton who once told a senior advisor : " it 's the economy , stupid ! " , german politicians have adopted the economy as the main issue in their election campaigns .
however , this year ’ s slogan is slightly different to clinton 's relatively moderate one ten years before .
today its more like " jobs , jobs , jobs ! " the spd one of the strongest features in this year ’ s election campaign , is the image of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- as protector of the public purse , with finance minister hans eichel as its strict treasurer .
" we 've abandoned the path of becoming a nation of debt and have made that our trademark , " the party 's election platform states .
the party is pledging to submit a balanced budget to parliament by 2006 .
through " solid financial policy , " the social democrats believe they can keep consumer prices stable , boost economic growth and create new jobs . in order to reduce german unemployment – at current more than four million - the spd is seeking to make low-pay jobs more attractive to employees and more affordable for employers .
the government wants to subsidize jobs with below-average low wages with payments between 325 and 800 euro in order to encourage the unemployed to take on what would otherwise be possibly unprofitable jobs . the spd has also pledged special federal job creation aid for germany ’ s eastern states , where unemployment is at a staggering 18 per cent .
the spd has said it will fund the new programs by setting " new priorities " and offering " more focused " social insurance benefits to people living in germany .
party strategists also hope to stretch the existing budget by merging the country 's unemployment and social welfare systems . families also play a central role in the social democrats ' party platform .
the party wants to introduce incremental increases of the german kindergeld , or child allowance , currently paid to families with children from the current 154 euro a month to 200 euro a month .
in the wake of criticism over germany 's dismal performance in the international pisa schools comparison study , the party also also wants to introduce more all-day schools across the country and initiate additional school reform initiatives .
it is prepared to spend 4 billion euro over the next four years to fulfill these ideas . the spd has also proposed reducing tax advantages currently enjoyed by married couples , instead providing them to single parents .
the party also wants to create programs encouraging companies to make more apprenticeships and training programs available , which are required in many vocations before a young person can be given a permanent job . cdu / csu for the first time in their 50-year history , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have come together to create a joint election platform .
citing the “ 40 ” as its magic september 22 number , the so-called union bloc 's priority is to attract a minimum of 40 per cent of voters and to cut to below 40 per cent of the highest tax rate , employment side costs for businesses and the country 's social insurance expenditures as well as the ratio of government expenditures to gross national product . like the spd , the union bloc also has its own proposal for the low-wage sector .
it wants to increase the current combination of low wages and subsidies from 325 euro a month to 400 .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lack in jobs for young people is a sticking point in this year 's election campaign the main issue in this year 's federal election will be germany 's stagnating economy .
however issues , including the role of german military still play a prominent role in all major parties . with more than four million unemployed and a stagnating economy , germany 's biggest parties are focusing on measures to spur growth and get people off the dole in the current election campaign . as germany counts the days to the federal elections on september 22 , the country 's six major political parties are busy stumping with their campaign platforms in an effort to win over undecided and swing voters . three major themes will be at the center of almost all every party platforms this year : the economy , employment and the social insurance system .
similar to the words of former us president bill clinton who once told a senior advisor : " it 's the economy , stupid ! " , german politicians have adopted the economy as the main issue in their election campaigns .
however , this year ’ s slogan is slightly different to clinton 's relatively moderate one ten years before .
today its more like " jobs , jobs , jobs ! " the spd one of the strongest features in this year ’ s election campaign , is the image of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- as protector of the public purse , with finance minister hans eichel as its strict treasurer .
" we 've abandoned the path of becoming a nation of debt and have made that our trademark , " the party 's election platform states .
the party is pledging to submit a balanced budget to parliament by 2006 .
through " solid financial policy , " the social democrats believe they can keep consumer prices stable , boost economic growth and create new jobs . in order to reduce german unemployment – at current more than four million - the spd is seeking to make low-pay jobs more attractive to employees and more affordable for employers .
the government wants to subsidize jobs with below-average low wages with payments between 325 and 800 euro in order to encourage the unemployed to take on what would otherwise be possibly unprofitable jobs . the spd has also pledged special federal job creation aid for germany ’ s eastern states , where unemployment is at a staggering 18 per cent .
the spd has said it will fund the new programs by setting " new priorities " and offering " more focused " social insurance benefits to people living in germany .
party strategists also hope to stretch the existing budget by merging the country 's unemployment and social welfare systems . families also play a central role in the social democrats ' party platform .
the party wants to introduce incremental increases of the german kindergeld , or child allowance , currently paid to families with children from the current 154 euro a month to 200 euro a month .
in the wake of criticism over germany 's dismal performance in the international pisa schools comparison study , the party also also wants to introduce more all-day schools across the country and initiate additional school reform initiatives .
it is prepared to spend 4 billion euro over the next four years to fulfill these ideas . the spd has also proposed reducing tax advantages currently enjoyed by married couples , instead providing them to single parents .
the party also wants to create programs encouraging companies to make more apprenticeships and training programs available , which are required in many vocations before a young person can be given a permanent job . cdu / csu for the first time in their 50-year history , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have come together to create a joint election platform .
citing the “ 40 ” as its magic september 22 number , the so-called union bloc 's priority is to attract a minimum of 40 per cent of voters and to cut to below 40 per cent of the highest tax rate , employment side costs for businesses and the country 's social insurance expenditures as well as the ratio of government expenditures to gross national product . like the spd , the union bloc also has its own proposal for the low-wage sector .
it wants to increase the current combination of low wages and subsidies from 325 euro a month to 400 .
like the spd , the union says combination-wage programs can be made possible by reducing government contributions to other social insurance programs , and that doing so will create new jobs . the union also says it will address the beleaguered eastern german economy with its own revitalization program .
if elected in september , the parties are proposing new laws that would accelerate investment in the sinking construction industry , make it easier for small firms to grow and do a better job of protecting industry in the east . the union also proposes increasing the budget of the bundeswehr , germany 's army .
it says the resource-strapped army , which has been stretched thin with close to 10,000 soldiers currently serving on foreign missions , is in bad need of more money in order to be capable of meeting its international defense obligations under nato and the united nations . the union differentiates itself from the current social democrat and greens-led government in three other key areas : it wants to amend laws currently on the books ordering the closure of all of germany 's nuclear power plants , increases in the country 's environment tax and the recently passed immigration law , which was approved under controversial circumstances in the country 's higher legislative chamber and now faces a federal constitutional court challenge . the greens in march , germany ’ s powerful left-wing party , the greens , voted to amend the uncompromising anti-war plank that had long topped its list of party principles .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lack in jobs for young people is a sticking point in this year 's election campaign the main issue in this year 's federal election will be germany 's stagnating economy .
however issues , including the role of german military still play a prominent role in all major parties . with more than four million unemployed and a stagnating economy , germany 's biggest parties are focusing on measures to spur growth and get people off the dole in the current election campaign . as germany counts the days to the federal elections on september 22 , the country 's six major political parties are busy stumping with their campaign platforms in an effort to win over undecided and swing voters . three major themes will be at the center of almost all every party platforms this year : the economy , employment and the social insurance system .
similar to the words of former us president bill clinton who once told a senior advisor : " it 's the economy , stupid ! " , german politicians have adopted the economy as the main issue in their election campaigns .
however , this year ’ s slogan is slightly different to clinton 's relatively moderate one ten years before .
today its more like " jobs , jobs , jobs ! " the spd one of the strongest features in this year ’ s election campaign , is the image of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- as protector of the public purse , with finance minister hans eichel as its strict treasurer .
" we 've abandoned the path of becoming a nation of debt and have made that our trademark , " the party 's election platform states .
the party is pledging to submit a balanced budget to parliament by 2006 .
through " solid financial policy , " the social democrats believe they can keep consumer prices stable , boost economic growth and create new jobs . in order to reduce german unemployment – at current more than four million - the spd is seeking to make low-pay jobs more attractive to employees and more affordable for employers .
the government wants to subsidize jobs with below-average low wages with payments between 325 and 800 euro in order to encourage the unemployed to take on what would otherwise be possibly unprofitable jobs . the spd has also pledged special federal job creation aid for germany ’ s eastern states , where unemployment is at a staggering 18 per cent .
the spd has said it will fund the new programs by setting " new priorities " and offering " more focused " social insurance benefits to people living in germany .
party strategists also hope to stretch the existing budget by merging the country 's unemployment and social welfare systems . families also play a central role in the social democrats ' party platform .
the party wants to introduce incremental increases of the german kindergeld , or child allowance , currently paid to families with children from the current 154 euro a month to 200 euro a month .
in the wake of criticism over germany 's dismal performance in the international pisa schools comparison study , the party also also wants to introduce more all-day schools across the country and initiate additional school reform initiatives .
it is prepared to spend 4 billion euro over the next four years to fulfill these ideas . the spd has also proposed reducing tax advantages currently enjoyed by married couples , instead providing them to single parents .
the party also wants to create programs encouraging companies to make more apprenticeships and training programs available , which are required in many vocations before a young person can be given a permanent job . cdu / csu for the first time in their 50-year history , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have come together to create a joint election platform .
citing the “ 40 ” as its magic september 22 number , the so-called union bloc 's priority is to attract a minimum of 40 per cent of voters and to cut to below 40 per cent of the highest tax rate , employment side costs for businesses and the country 's social insurance expenditures as well as the ratio of government expenditures to gross national product . like the spd , the union bloc also has its own proposal for the low-wage sector .
it wants to increase the current combination of low wages and subsidies from 325 euro a month to 400 .
like the spd , the union says combination-wage programs can be made possible by reducing government contributions to other social insurance programs , and that doing so will create new jobs . the union also says it will address the beleaguered eastern german economy with its own revitalization program .
if elected in september , the parties are proposing new laws that would accelerate investment in the sinking construction industry , make it easier for small firms to grow and do a better job of protecting industry in the east . the union also proposes increasing the budget of the bundeswehr , germany 's army .
it says the resource-strapped army , which has been stretched thin with close to 10,000 soldiers currently serving on foreign missions , is in bad need of more money in order to be capable of meeting its international defense obligations under nato and the united nations . the union differentiates itself from the current social democrat and greens-led government in three other key areas : it wants to amend laws currently on the books ordering the closure of all of germany 's nuclear power plants , increases in the country 's environment tax and the recently passed immigration law , which was approved under controversial circumstances in the country 's higher legislative chamber and now faces a federal constitutional court challenge . the greens in march , germany ’ s powerful left-wing party , the greens , voted to amend the uncompromising anti-war plank that had long topped its list of party principles .
however , by this time the party had already made the shift in practice - it was green leader joschka fischer and his party who co-authorized the first use of military force in germany ’ s post-war history , committing troops to nato ’ s 1999 bombing campaign in yugoslavia . in 2001 there followed the second authorization of the deployment of troops abroad , namely to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and in 2001 the third : 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom in the us-led " war on terror " .
the party also turned its back on radical pacifism and accepted the military presence of the united states in europe .
but it did so with an important condition : " the further reduction of our military potential must remain our goal . " this year , the party has set a goal of winning at least eight per cent of voters .
its election platform focuses on the environment , proposals to increase consumer protection and equality .
the greens also want to combine the country 's unemployment and social welfare benefits in order to create a unified safety net for all germans .
a special program within that infrastructure would be aimed at keeping families with children and , especially , single parents from slipping beneath the poverty level .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lack in jobs for young people is a sticking point in this year 's election campaign the main issue in this year 's federal election will be germany 's stagnating economy .
however issues , including the role of german military still play a prominent role in all major parties . with more than four million unemployed and a stagnating economy , germany 's biggest parties are focusing on measures to spur growth and get people off the dole in the current election campaign . as germany counts the days to the federal elections on september 22 , the country 's six major political parties are busy stumping with their campaign platforms in an effort to win over undecided and swing voters . three major themes will be at the center of almost all every party platforms this year : the economy , employment and the social insurance system .
similar to the words of former us president bill clinton who once told a senior advisor : " it 's the economy , stupid ! " , german politicians have adopted the economy as the main issue in their election campaigns .
however , this year ’ s slogan is slightly different to clinton 's relatively moderate one ten years before .
today its more like " jobs , jobs , jobs ! " the spd one of the strongest features in this year ’ s election campaign , is the image of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- as protector of the public purse , with finance minister hans eichel as its strict treasurer .
" we 've abandoned the path of becoming a nation of debt and have made that our trademark , " the party 's election platform states .
the party is pledging to submit a balanced budget to parliament by 2006 .
through " solid financial policy , " the social democrats believe they can keep consumer prices stable , boost economic growth and create new jobs . in order to reduce german unemployment – at current more than four million - the spd is seeking to make low-pay jobs more attractive to employees and more affordable for employers .
the government wants to subsidize jobs with below-average low wages with payments between 325 and 800 euro in order to encourage the unemployed to take on what would otherwise be possibly unprofitable jobs . the spd has also pledged special federal job creation aid for germany ’ s eastern states , where unemployment is at a staggering 18 per cent .
the spd has said it will fund the new programs by setting " new priorities " and offering " more focused " social insurance benefits to people living in germany .
party strategists also hope to stretch the existing budget by merging the country 's unemployment and social welfare systems . families also play a central role in the social democrats ' party platform .
the party wants to introduce incremental increases of the german kindergeld , or child allowance , currently paid to families with children from the current 154 euro a month to 200 euro a month .
in the wake of criticism over germany 's dismal performance in the international pisa schools comparison study , the party also also wants to introduce more all-day schools across the country and initiate additional school reform initiatives .
it is prepared to spend 4 billion euro over the next four years to fulfill these ideas . the spd has also proposed reducing tax advantages currently enjoyed by married couples , instead providing them to single parents .
the party also wants to create programs encouraging companies to make more apprenticeships and training programs available , which are required in many vocations before a young person can be given a permanent job . cdu / csu for the first time in their 50-year history , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have come together to create a joint election platform .
citing the “ 40 ” as its magic september 22 number , the so-called union bloc 's priority is to attract a minimum of 40 per cent of voters and to cut to below 40 per cent of the highest tax rate , employment side costs for businesses and the country 's social insurance expenditures as well as the ratio of government expenditures to gross national product . like the spd , the union bloc also has its own proposal for the low-wage sector .
it wants to increase the current combination of low wages and subsidies from 325 euro a month to 400 .
like the spd , the union says combination-wage programs can be made possible by reducing government contributions to other social insurance programs , and that doing so will create new jobs . the union also says it will address the beleaguered eastern german economy with its own revitalization program .
if elected in september , the parties are proposing new laws that would accelerate investment in the sinking construction industry , make it easier for small firms to grow and do a better job of protecting industry in the east . the union also proposes increasing the budget of the bundeswehr , germany 's army .
it says the resource-strapped army , which has been stretched thin with close to 10,000 soldiers currently serving on foreign missions , is in bad need of more money in order to be capable of meeting its international defense obligations under nato and the united nations . the union differentiates itself from the current social democrat and greens-led government in three other key areas : it wants to amend laws currently on the books ordering the closure of all of germany 's nuclear power plants , increases in the country 's environment tax and the recently passed immigration law , which was approved under controversial circumstances in the country 's higher legislative chamber and now faces a federal constitutional court challenge . the greens in march , germany ’ s powerful left-wing party , the greens , voted to amend the uncompromising anti-war plank that had long topped its list of party principles .
however , by this time the party had already made the shift in practice - it was green leader joschka fischer and his party who co-authorized the first use of military force in germany ’ s post-war history , committing troops to nato ’ s 1999 bombing campaign in yugoslavia . in 2001 there followed the second authorization of the deployment of troops abroad , namely to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , and in 2001 the third : 3,900 soldiers for operation enduring freedom in the us-led " war on terror " .
the party also turned its back on radical pacifism and accepted the military presence of the united states in europe .
but it did so with an important condition : " the further reduction of our military potential must remain our goal . " this year , the party has set a goal of winning at least eight per cent of voters .
its election platform focuses on the environment , proposals to increase consumer protection and equality .
the greens also want to combine the country 's unemployment and social welfare benefits in order to create a unified safety net for all germans .
a special program within that infrastructure would be aimed at keeping families with children and , especially , single parents from slipping beneath the poverty level .
as it has in previous elections , the green party is also demanding a " society free of gender discrimination . " the free democrats the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has positioned itself as the business-friendly party of tax cuts .
one of its chief goals is to simplify germany 's byzantine tax-filing procedure and replace it with a one-page filing form similar to the 1040ez form which is used in the united states .
the party also wants to cut tax rates to 15 , 25 or 35 per cent based on income . other parties have dismissed the fdp 's lofty tax-cut pledges as implausible .
" ideas like that will sort themselves out very quickly , " said lothar späth , the former ceo of eastern german success story jenaoptik , now a senior political advisor to bavarian premier and opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber . the free democrats are setting their sights on the middle class with campaign slogans like " job machine no. 1 " and calls for leaner government .
education is another central theme in the fdp ’ s party platform .
the free democrats want to spur greater competition in the higher education sector by giving universities and technical colleges greater autonomy . in order to fuel job growth , the fdp wants to liberalize the country 's employment termination laws in order to make firing and , it hopes , hiring easier for the small-sized businesses it has recognized as the key to growth .

but many insurers are struggling to remain afloat while paying out their holders ’ policies . after suffering through nearly a week of torrential downpours and record-breaking floods , germany and europe are just starting to clean up and calculate the damages .
everywhere one looks , the heavy rainfall and unseasonable storms have left a trail of chaos and destruction .
both private and public property has been ruined , agricultural land has been destroyed , and the infrastructure in large parts of europe has come to a standstill .
" the full extent of damage is not yet definable , " said manfred goedecke , director of the german chambers of industry and commerce , to reporters on wednesday .
the losses are incalculable for households and businesses in the regions most hardest hit .
and of course the damage also effects the insurance industry , which suddenly sees itself forced to pay out large sums of money to policy holders at a time when the industry itself is treading water .
uncertain cost forecasts allianz and many other insurers in europe are reluctant to say how much the recent weather catastrophe will cost them in the end .
but with thousands of households and businesses effected by the flooding , the list of damages is likely to be long , and the claims on the insurance companies high .
" it ’ s too early for an accurate estimate of costs , " helmut perlet , board member of germany ’ s largest insurer allianz , told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" we ’ re still busy cleaning up , " and therefore the dimensions can ’ t yet be calculated .
the federal association of german insurers echoes this thinking , saying " at the time , we can ’ t get a clear overview of how high the claims ’ costs will be . "
but what ’ s certain is that the financial consequences of the flooding will be extensive and exceed the amount insurance companies paid out in earlier years for similar flood and storm coverage .
" the year 2002 will diverge significantly from the long-term average in terms of flood and storm damage claims , " said arno junke , director of germany ’ s branch for general cologne re , the world ’ s third largest re-insurer .
and according to allianz , the amount of damages caused by bad weather has increased fourfold just in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year .
unusual weather leads to unusually high costs weather has always played a role in insurance policy coverage .
one need only think of the annual flooding of the rhine .
but the recent series of natural catastrophes has been more extreme , say industry experts .
" what ’ s new about the newest wave of bad weather is the considerable frequency with which storms and floods have left severe damage behind .
there were always large single catastrophes like hurricane lothar in 1999 .
but now the insurance industry has to deal with an unusually high number of catastrophes with excessive damages , " junke explained .
trouble on the horizon for insurers ?
if the meteorological and industry forecasts hold true and more bad weather strikes europe more often , insurers may find themselves struggling to stay above water .
in the long-term , industry analysts say financially-strapped companies could have difficulty coming up with the cash necessary to pay policy holders filing claims for flood and storm coverage .
" the insurance industry won ’ t be able to shoulder everything , " junke predicts .
this could especially be the case for small insurers suffering from liquidity problems .
large insurance companies such as allianz have faired the storm fairly well , but they too are facing increasing pressure to sell off devalued stocks to cover mounting policy claims .
at the moment allianz says it does not need to readjust its expected yearly gains , however , much is riding on whether or not fall and winter turn out to be stormy seasons .
in this regard , both the insurers and the meteorologists seem to be playing the same game : let ’ s wait and see .
as for an increase in premium costs , insurance experts have said that it ’ s still too early for any clear statements and that only a long-term series of catastrophes would prompt that .
the question is whether or not that catastrophe occurs within the insurance sector . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life insurers move toward setting up emergency fund germany ’ s life insurers are taking accelerated steps toward a joint emergency fund to bail out struggling firms , and executives see the effects of stock market volatility as the industry ’ s prime headache -lrb- aug .

but many insurers are struggling to remain afloat while paying out their holders ’ policies . after suffering through nearly a week of torrential downpours and record-breaking floods , germany and europe are just starting to clean up and calculate the damages .
everywhere one looks , the heavy rainfall and unseasonable storms have left a trail of chaos and destruction .
both private and public property has been ruined , agricultural land has been destroyed , and the infrastructure in large parts of europe has come to a standstill .
" the full extent of damage is not yet definable , " said manfred goedecke , director of the german chambers of industry and commerce , to reporters on wednesday .
the losses are incalculable for households and businesses in the regions most hardest hit .
and of course the damage also effects the insurance industry , which suddenly sees itself forced to pay out large sums of money to policy holders at a time when the industry itself is treading water .
uncertain cost forecasts allianz and many other insurers in europe are reluctant to say how much the recent weather catastrophe will cost them in the end .
but with thousands of households and businesses effected by the flooding , the list of damages is likely to be long , and the claims on the insurance companies high .
" it ’ s too early for an accurate estimate of costs , " helmut perlet , board member of germany ’ s largest insurer allianz , told the financial daily handelsblatt .
" we ’ re still busy cleaning up , " and therefore the dimensions can ’ t yet be calculated .
the federal association of german insurers echoes this thinking , saying " at the time , we can ’ t get a clear overview of how high the claims ’ costs will be . "
but what ’ s certain is that the financial consequences of the flooding will be extensive and exceed the amount insurance companies paid out in earlier years for similar flood and storm coverage .
" the year 2002 will diverge significantly from the long-term average in terms of flood and storm damage claims , " said arno junke , director of germany ’ s branch for general cologne re , the world ’ s third largest re-insurer .
and according to allianz , the amount of damages caused by bad weather has increased fourfold just in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year .
unusual weather leads to unusually high costs weather has always played a role in insurance policy coverage .
one need only think of the annual flooding of the rhine .
but the recent series of natural catastrophes has been more extreme , say industry experts .
" what ’ s new about the newest wave of bad weather is the considerable frequency with which storms and floods have left severe damage behind .
there were always large single catastrophes like hurricane lothar in 1999 .
but now the insurance industry has to deal with an unusually high number of catastrophes with excessive damages , " junke explained .
trouble on the horizon for insurers ?
if the meteorological and industry forecasts hold true and more bad weather strikes europe more often , insurers may find themselves struggling to stay above water .
in the long-term , industry analysts say financially-strapped companies could have difficulty coming up with the cash necessary to pay policy holders filing claims for flood and storm coverage .
" the insurance industry won ’ t be able to shoulder everything , " junke predicts .
this could especially be the case for small insurers suffering from liquidity problems .

former enron executive michael kopper pleaded guilty on wednesday to charges of money laundering and wire fraud .
the role of mr fastow is under scrutiny the guilty pleas are the first criminal charges brought against a former enron employee , and represent significant progress in the us government investigation into the scandal .
" the action against mr kopper is an important chapter in the story of enron 's collapse , " said stephen cutler , head of enforcement at the securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- .
" but much of the story remains untold . "
as part of the plea deal , mr kopper will co-operate with prosecutors , and will pay back $ 12m -lrb- £ 7.9m -rrb- of assets , but he could still face a jail term of up to 15 years .
kenneth lay had run enron for more than 15 years the reuters news agency also reported that the us justice department has asked a federal judge to freeze about $ 23m of funds controlled by former enron chief financial officer andrew fastow and other company executives .
" this money is treated as tainted and can be reclaimed by the government , " the agency quoted a senior justice department official as saying .
mr kopper was the right-hand man to mr fastow , whose role in enron 's collapse is now coming under intense scrutiny from prosecutors .
enron was once one of the us 's most admired companies , but went bankrupt last december after admitting to questionable accounting practices .
more charges the -lrb- sec -rrb- also announced on wednesday that it had filed civil charges against mr kopper .
we have a wealth of information in our possession suggesting a number of people at enron took part in fraudulent activities ken johnson , house energy and commerce committee the sec said it had charged mr kopper with breaking securities anti-fraud laws .
mr kopper has neither admitted or denied the charges .
mr kopper worked in enron 's global finance unit and took a lead role in the formation of the off-balance-sheet partnerships central to enron 's collapse .
these partnerships were largely financed by company stock and had no real value .
they were used to hide $ 1bn of debt , and make the company look financially stronger than it actually was .
an internal investigation by enron directors blamed mr fastow for creating and operating the partnerships .
but the study also found that mr kopper was closely involved , and that this led to considerable personal gain .
it alleged that he earned $ 10.5m from an original investment of $ 125,000 in one partnership .
previously silent government investigators are looking into how much enron managers - from former chairman kenneth lay on down - knew about the partnerships .
the complexity of the partnership arrangements has made it difficult to apportion blame to individuals involved in the enron affair .
pressure has been mounting on investigators , who have already charged senior executives in the andersen , adelphia and worldcom scandals .
" the government is taking the traditional route of applying tremendous pressure to individuals and striking deals with carefully selected insiders who will lead them through the byzantine transactions , " said former federal prosecutor robert mintz .
the spokesman for the house energy and commerce committee , ken johnson , said many more enron executives could be charged .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- back from the dead : uk 's new language news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : uk news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england n ireland scotland wales politics education business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk thursday , 22 august , 2002 , 06:03 gmt 07:03 uk back from the dead : uk 's new language by jonathan duffy bbc news online britain is about to get a new official language .
it dates back to the 9th century and is hundreds of years older than modern english .
but there 's one problem - which version to use ?
the english language is far and away britannia 's greatest export .
it is geographically the most widespread language on earth and 40 % of europeans claim to know english as a foreign tongue .
what does cornish sound like ?
click here to find out .
at home however , things are rather different .
in recent years , there has been a resurgence of ancient celtic tongues around the british isles .
cornwall 's greatest export ?
seafood chef rick stein several have official minority status and now cornish looks like joining them as a protected language .
do n't hold your breath if you are expecting bi-lingual road signs around the south west , as is the case in wales .
rather , public bodies will have to protect and promote the use of cornish .
it will be illegal for them to discriminate against cornish speakers and they will have a duty not to suppress the language .
its new status is not yet official but st ives mp andrew george says he has been given the governmental nod and an announcement is expected in the autumn .
uk 's official minority languages 1 : welsh 2 : gaelic -lrb- scottish -rrb- 3 : gaelic -lrb- irish -rrb- 4 : scots 5 : ulster scots the news is a victory for the handful of fluent speakers of the language .
" the last government was n't interested and we 've been campaigning for this for about seven years , " says george ansell , of the cornish language board .
yet amid the back slapping , there is disagreement over which brand of cornish should get the official stamp .
" it 's an emotionally charged issue , " acknowledges prof philip payton , of the institute of cornish studies .
the language has at least three strands , based around different spellings and some varying vocabulary .
they are : modern cornish unified cornish common cornish dating back to the 9th century , the cornish language evolved over hundreds of years and claimed an estimated 40,000 speakers at the time of the norman conquest , before dying out around 1800 .
modern cornish heralds from the end of that period , drawing on points of grammar and pronunciation that were documented as the language expired .
the country has a rich and fascinating history at the time , cornish was becoming heavily influenced by english which had steamrollered its way through the county .
that spirit is maintained in the revised version of modern cornish used today , which is not shy about borrowing english words such as " telephone " and " television " .
yet when the first cornish revival picked up steam in the 20th century , it drew instead on an older version of the language .
keeping a distance by the 1920s this revised form became known as unified cornish .
and 1988 saw a breakaway faction known as common cornish .
it 'll certainly fool the tourists each version uses its own unique spellings , and new words have been thought up to steer clear of the english influence .
" pellgowser " is the common cornish word for " telephone " -lrb- it literally translates as " far-speaker " -rrb- ; " pellwollok " is " television " and " gwydheo " is " video " .
there are even words for " internet " - " kesroesweyth " and " e-mail " - " e-bost " -lrb- literally , " e-post " -rrb- .
modern cornish devotee richard gendall says the rival dialects are " makey uppy " and " pseudo celtic " .
dressing it up " it was all part of a drive in the last century to overstate cornwall 's celtic roots .
they even came up with a cornish kilt and cornish bagpipes .
these never existed , " says mr glendall .
eden project ?
is there a common cornish translation " i 'm a pragmatist .
i accept that cornish was heavily influenced by english culture and language before it died out . "
yet common cornish speaker paul dunbar winces at the thought of english infecting the cornish tongue .
" students do n't want to be breaking into english several times in a sentence when talking about something technical .
it 's irritating to have to use the language that bloody murdered cornish , " he says .
it 's impossible say who has the high ground .
there are few hard facts , but it 's generally agreed common cornish is the most widely spoken .
it has been particularly successful at cornering the market for new learners .
yet modern cornish is purer , says prof payton , who " shares the academic scepticism " about its main rival .
the language saw some rocky years so what does the future hold ?
prof payton and george ansell agree the generic cornish language will be officially recognised , rather than one particular dialect .
after that " it 's for the people of the cornish language to decide " says prof payton .
" it may be we chose one at the expense of the other , or that we agree to recognise a plurality , or that some years down the line there will be a convergence of them all . "
what does cornish sound like ?
here modern cornish speaker richard gendall translates some phrases tourists may find useful .
" this blistering cornish sunshine has left me absolutely parched ... "
listen to it in cornish " i was n't expecting to surf in newquay today ... "
listen to it in cornish " i was looking forward to a lovely plate of bigbury bay oysters ... "

it dates back to the 9th century and is hundreds of years older than modern english .
but there 's one problem - which version to use ?
the english language is far and away britannia 's greatest export .
it is geographically the most widespread language on earth and 40 % of europeans claim to know english as a foreign tongue .
at home however , things are rather different .
in recent years , there has been a resurgence of ancient celtic tongues around the british isles .
several have official minority status and now cornish looks like joining them as a protected language .
do n't hold your breath if you are expecting bi-lingual road signs around the south west , as is the case in wales .
rather , public bodies will have to protect and promote the use of cornish .
it will be illegal for them to discriminate against cornish speakers and they will have a duty not to suppress the language .
its new status is not yet official but st ives mp andrew george says he has been given the governmental nod and an announcement is expected in the autumn .
uk 's official minority languages 1 : welsh 2 : gaelic -lrb- scottish -rrb- 3 : gaelic -lrb- irish -rrb- 4 : scots 5 : ulster scots the news is a victory for the handful of fluent speakers of the language .
" the last government was n't interested and we 've been campaigning for this for about seven years , " says george ansell , of the cornish language board .
yet amid the back slapping , there is disagreement over which brand of cornish should get the official stamp .
" it 's an emotionally charged issue , " acknowledges prof philip payton , of the institute of cornish studies .
the language has at least three strands , based around different spellings and some varying vocabulary .
they are : modern cornish unified cornish common cornish dating back to the 9th century , the cornish language evolved over hundreds of years and claimed an estimated 40,000 speakers at the time of the norman conquest , before dying out around 1800 .
modern cornish heralds from the end of that period , drawing on points of grammar and pronunciation that were documented as the language expired .
at the time , cornish was becoming heavily influenced by english which had steamrollered its way through the county .
that spirit is maintained in the revised version of modern cornish used today , which is not shy about borrowing english words such as " telephone " and " television " .
yet when the first cornish revival picked up steam in the 20th century , it drew instead on an older version of the language .
keeping a distance by the 1920s this revised form became known as unified cornish .
and 1988 saw a breakaway faction known as common cornish .
each version uses its own unique spellings , and new words have been thought up to steer clear of the english influence .
" pellgowser " is the common cornish word for " telephone " -lrb- it literally translates as " far-speaker " -rrb- ; " pellwollok " is " television " and " gwydheo " is " video " .
there are even words for " internet " - " kesroesweyth " and " e-mail " - " e-bost " -lrb- literally , " e-post " -rrb- .
modern cornish devotee richard gendall says the rival dialects are " makey uppy " and " pseudo celtic " .
dressing it up " it was all part of a drive in the last century to overstate cornwall 's celtic roots .
they even came up with a cornish kilt and cornish bagpipes .
these never existed , " says mr glendall .
" i 'm a pragmatist .
i accept that cornish was heavily influenced by english culture and language before it died out . "
yet common cornish speaker paul dunbar winces at the thought of english infecting the cornish tongue .
" students do n't want to be breaking into english several times in a sentence when talking about something technical .
it 's irritating to have to use the language that bloody murdered cornish , " he says .
it 's impossible say who has the high ground .
there are few hard facts , but it 's generally agreed common cornish is the most widely spoken .
it has been particularly successful at cornering the market for new learners .
yet modern cornish is purer , says prof payton , who " shares the academic scepticism " about its main rival .
so what does the future hold ?
prof payton and george ansell agree the generic cornish language will be officially recognised , rather than one particular dialect .
after that " it 's for the people of the cornish language to decide " says prof payton .
" it may be we chose one at the expense of the other , or that we agree to recognise a plurality , or that some years down the line there will be a convergence of them all . "
what does cornish sound like ?
here modern cornish speaker richard gendall translates some phrases tourists may find useful .
" this blistering cornish sunshine has left me absolutely parched ... "
" i was n't expecting to surf in newquay today ... "
" i was looking forward to a lovely plate of bigbury bay oysters ... "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- north korea brings in ' market reform ' news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : business news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business e-commerce economy market data entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk thursday , 22 august , 2002 , 06:13 gmt 07:13 uk north korea brings in ' market reform ' more north koreans are seeking asylum in the south famine-hit north korea has started to introduce " market reforms " , south korea 's central bank has said .
there have been numerous rumours about a gradual move away from a planned economy , but this is the first time that the top watchers of the north korean economy have confirmed the policy change .
north korea is said to have scrapped ration coupons and raised the price of rice to more than 50 times its previous level .
the prices of fuel , transport and housing have also risen , the report said .
north korea has also introduced a big increase in wages to help the now coupon-less workers to pay cash for goods sold at the new rates .
the reforms include freeing up companies to set prices and trade with other firms to obtain raw materials , as well as allowing them to offer productivity incentives .
historic move " this is the first step towards adopting a market economy , " said the bank of korea , which monitors its northern neighbour closely .
it does seem to represent a recognition ... of the need to introduce some reforms in these areas in order to increase production kenzo oshima , un it said the reforms , which have not been officially announced by north korea , were introduced in july .
the two koreas have followed dramatically different paths since the korean war - still not officially over - led to the partition of the pacific peninsular in the early 1950s .
the north is ruled by a communist regime , and is one of the world 's most secretive countries , branded part of an " axis of evil " by us president george w bush because of its weapons programme .
south korea embraced the global economy in the 1960s to turn itself into one of the world 's major hi-tech exporters .
hundreds of thousands of north koreans are thought to have died in the famine which struck the country in 1996 .
workers get bonuses in an effort to stimulate productivity , firms have also been given the right to share profits with their workers by awarding them bonuses .
workers received a 20-fold increase in wages in july .
north koreans are now paid about 2,000 north korean won a month , instead of 100-150 won .
there are reports that north korea 's currency has been devalued to 150 won to the us dollar from 2.15 before .
if so , the new salaries are worth about $ 13 -lrb- £ 8.50 -rrb- a month .
since the increase in wages is less than the increase in the price of rice , rationing will continue to exist , but using some form of market mechanisms .
although north korea has not officially announced the changes , a senior un official dealing with emergency relief work has confirmed they have taken place .
" it does seem to represent a recognition on the part of authorities of the need to introduce some reforms in these areas in order to increase production , and to produce some incentive mechanisms , " said kenzo oshima , un under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs .
some observers , though , have raised doubts to what extent the reforms will be able to create a true market economy , and whether north korean society - living for decades under a stalinist regime - can cope with the concept of free markets .

combat effectiveness delays in acquiring a combat identification system were even impeding the effectiveness of some weapons systems , say the mps .
nine british troops were killed by friendly fire in the gulf the £ 2bn rapier air defence missile system had to operate at just 25 % of its potential capability in order to minimise the risk of " friendly fire " casualties , the report says .

the head of the national probation service , eithne wallis , said it was considering the use of polygraph machines following a series of successful trials last year .
it is thought the tests , involving 30 sex offenders in three english counties , prevented at least three of them committing new attacks .
ms wallis told bbc radio 4 's today programme that more research was needed , but lie detectors could be used alongside existing methods to help manage paedophiles and other sex offenders in the community .
victims forensic psychiatrist professor don grubin , who oversaw the tests said convicted paedophiles had revealed unauthorised contact with children when the lie detectors were used .
they are very deviant types of individual and are usually very skilled at being manipulative polygraph examiner he said the men , in surrey , northumberland and the west midlands , admitted visiting areas where they might meet children .
" they were beginning to go in search of victims , " professor grubin said .
" they had n't offended yet but had no doubt in three of these cases they would have done . "
heart rate the sex offenders , who were all on probation , were asked a series of questions about their past offending , current behaviour and fantasies .
they were asked if they had been in contact with children or on the look-out for victims .
the polygraphs measured their physical responses , including heart rate , to see if they were lying and help build up a clearer picture of their progress on treatment programmes .
paedophilia provokes a great deal of anger sandy gray , a polygraph operator in phoenix , arizona , told the bbc she believed it was a safer way of keeping track of a paedophile 's behaviour .
she said : " they are very deviant types of individual and are usually very skilled at being manipulative , but monitoring via polygraph is far better than accepting a self report , or them telling you what they have been doing . "
and uk-based polygraph examiner bruce burgess said : " they have a reputation as not being seen as reliable , but i believe they are as reliable as other methods of catching criminals , certainly more reliable than handwriting or eye witnesses . "
' scrutiny ' ms wallis agreed polygraph testing could eventually be used by the probation service to monitor sex offenders , but more research was needed first .
they are so devious i wonder whether technology can keep pace with them and effectively monitor them roger stoodley " if it worked and if there was a robust , demonstrable level of reliability it may be that there would be a place for that as a piece of supporting information in our management of sex offenders , " she said .
" in some other countries lie detector tests have been used , and various claims are being made about them .
" we will see whether or not these claims that are made stand up to scrutiny and we will begin to think through do they have a place in the management of sex offenders or do they not . "
it is understood the home office is considering further trials of lie detectors on a larger scale - but plans are still in their early stages .
practised liars doubts over the accuracy of polygraphs mean they can not currently be used by police and are not accepted as evidence in the courts .
among those voicing concern about the reliability of lie detectors is roger stoodley , who led the investigation into a paedophile network which included the notorious child killer sidney cooke .
mr stoodley told today that sex offenders are practised liars and would be able to fool the most sophisticated equipment .
" i will support anything that will monitor sex offenders but i doubt that a polygraph is an efficient way of doing it , " he said .

the un suspended four-and-a-half years of negotiations on the issue in february after deciding that a joint tribunal with cambodia 's judicial system was unlikely to succeed .
right now , the door is beginning to open , but the problem is whether the security council or the general assembly will give the mandate prime minister hun sen but on tuesday , un secretary general kofi annan tried to break the impasse by offering to resume talks , providing he receives a mandate from the un security council or general assembly .
the un wants former khmer rouge leaders to be brought to trial for atrocities carried out by the regime between 1975 and 1979 in which 1.7 million people died .
close co-operation hun sen urged both the un and his government to work closely together to finally bring about the establishment of a tribunal .
" everything is already at a good point but we have to try to join together , not only cambodia but also the secretary general and other countries that are involved , " hun sen said .
" right now , the door is beginning to open , but the problem is whether the security council or the general assembly will give the mandate , " he added .
pol pot oversaw the genocide experts say that it should be possible to gain a mandate from the un general assembly , but that china , a permanent member of the security council could veto a trial .
china supported the khmer rouge , but maintains that any crimes against humanity carried out by the regime remain a domestic matter .
previous negotiations between the un and cambodia collapsed because of cambodia 's insistence that national law would take precedence over the agreement with the un in the trials .
there was also disagreement about who should go on trial - cambodia wants to restrict prosecution to about 10 selected khmer rouge figures .
evading justice hun sen has said that the if the focus of the tribunal is too wide it may reignite the country 's civil war which ended in 1998 .
the problem is compounded by the fact that many khmer rouge leaders defected to the government 's ranks at the end of the war .
no khmer rouge leader has ever faced trial for the " killing fields " atrocities carried out when they were in power .
the extreme maoist group seized control of cambodia in 1975 and about 1.7 million people are believed to have died during their reign of terror through execution , torture , starvation and hard labour .

" the figures it has come up with are not based on costs in the uk , " said a spokesman for bt wholesale .
a trial is about to take off that will provide broadband for as little as 16 users for a fraction of the normal cost of enabling an exchange .
but bt said it is not viable around the whole country .
" it is using different equipment that is only at the trial stage and also provides broadband via a single internet service provider which means there is less traffic and therefore can be carried over the existing network , " said the spokesman .
residents in pembury , kent are the closest to getting adsl in their area .
just over 100 residents have registered interest , around half those needed to get the exchange enabled .

" the figures it has come up with are not based on costs in the uk , " said a spokesman for bt wholesale .
a trial is about to take off that will provide broadband for as little as 16 users for a fraction of the normal cost of enabling an exchange .
but bt said it is not viable around the whole country .
" it is using different equipment that is only at the trial stage and also provides broadband via a single internet service provider which means there is less traffic and therefore can be carried over the existing network , " said the spokesman .
residents in pembury , kent are the closest to getting adsl in their area .
just over 100 residents have registered interest , around half those needed to get the exchange enabled .

education ministers can only repeat that they are worried by the " unacceptable " fact that girls beat boys in their gcses - by nine percentage points at the top grades this year .
some people blame a " laddish culture " among boys , which says it is not cool to study hard .
some say the exams are more geared towards girls because of the coursework involved .
both claims are being played down by the government , but what is the view in schools ?
' raise their game ' birmingham head teacher dexter hutt , of the ninestiles school , says boys are spending too much time watching football and not enough on their studies .
" they need to raise their game , " he said .
" the main reason for this is the culture of football that we have .
" a lot of lads are watching a lot of football during the week .
" i would guess that many boys are spending hours and hours playing championship manager on the computer and becoming real experts and it 's time that would be better spent on their gcses . "
one of mr hutt 's students , califah , who was pleased with his results of two bs and seven cs , says : " it 's all down to personal drive . "
there are no quick-fix solutions to the problems caused by the anti-learning laddish culture " head teachers ' leader david hart " there are a few distractions but i do my best . "
his class mate , kerry -lrb- two a * s , two as and eight bs -rrb- says it 's a question of maturity .
" girls mature earlier , they know what 's got to be done and they do it , " she said .
parent karen tate agrees .
her children attend coundon court school in coventry , which this year bucked the national trend by having boys achieve as high grades as girls .
the school taught boys separately for some lessons .
karen tate said : " my daughter is more determined .
she knows what she wants to do .
" james has always said ' i do n't know what to do ' .
i have to push him to do his homework . "
the general secretary of the national association of head teachers , david hart , said boys were dragging down the overall achievement .
" there is not a cat in hell 's chance of significantly reducing the 40 % of results that are below grade c , unless the boys raise their game , " he said .
" there are no quick-fix solutions to the problems caused by the anti-learning laddish culture .
" but solutions will have to be found if the government 's performance targets are to be met by the next election . "
the government says work is being done to try to close the gender gap .
the education minister margaret hodge , says she wants to " move away " from the claim that laddish culture is to blame .
" it 's very difficult to be certain what causes this , but we have to keep trying new techniques .
" we are giving scholarships to teachers who are good at dealing with gender difference .
" in the classroom , teachers are experimenting with teaching boys separately to girls , thinking about where they place the boys , sitting them boy-girl , boy-girl , rather than in a group of boys or girls . "
she also said it was important to choose texts which appealed to boys or girls , so that each could work on passages which interested them .
the exam boards insist they do everything they can to make their question papers and coursework gender-neutral .
the government has also tried to encourage fathers in particular to get more involved in their sons ' education - arguing that research shows this can have an important effect on their attainment .
one of the other claims made about girls out-performing boys is that it is because of a heavy element of course-work in gcses .
this is dismissed by sir william stubbs , the chairman of the exam regulator the qualifications and curriculum authority -lrb- qca -rrb- .
he says coursework used to make up about 50 % of gcses but now accounts for just 25 % of the marks .
sir william also says you can not just blame laddish culture for the gender gap .
" first of all , not all boys need to hang their heads in shame this morning , " he said .
" many are doing exceptionally well .
" i 'm not so sure the spotlight should be on the boys , but on those who are helping to stimulate the boys .
" it 's to do with the teachers in the classroom , the schools and the organisation , rather than the lads themselves . "
parent power at the secondary heads association , general secretary john dunford said parents had to do more .
" the widening gap is disappointing because schools have put enormous effort in recent years into raising the achievements of boys , " he said .
" it is not enough for parents to say , ' oh well , boys will be boys ' - schools need mothers and fathers to give more encouragement to their sons to perform well academically .
" i would agree that improved vocational qualifications and a clearer route to employment would help to motivate boys . "
self-adjusting ?
the leader of the biggest teachers ' union the nut , doug mcavoy , said there needed to be " a thorough review " .
" the fact that the gap between boys and girls has widened again at gcse needs to be examined , " he said .
" that gap is evident at a-level as well and should not simply be ignored by the government .
but his counterpart at the second biggest union , the nasuwt , eamonn o 'kane , was more relaxed about the figures .
" i think too much can be made about the disparity in results between girls and boys , " he said .
he said such phenomena had a habit of adjusting themselves , as was evidenced by last year 's results - when the gap narrowed very slightly .
one boy who is not worried about fitting in with laddish culture is 12 year old adam duchateau from ealing in west london .
he scored an a * in gcse maths at clifton lodge school .
he said : " i heard that boys think it 's not cool to study .
that does n't bother me .
" as long as you 've got your head screwed on then i do n't see the problem with working hard , " he said .

the bma has revealed that the money , which is distributed by the welsh assembly , is not reaching its indended destinations because local health authorities are not passing it on .
if we want to develop primary care , we have to have more resources dr bryn john the funds were unspent at the end of the last financial year .
since then , half of the money has been allocated for future projects , but around £ 5.5m - which amounts to around £ 8,000 per practice - still remained unaccounted for .
dr andrew dearden , chairman of the bma 's welsh gp committee , admitted being frustrated because gps are told that no money is available when they apply for more staff and extra services .
he felt the money was being used to balance books , despite being specifically intended for gps .
former chairman of the bma 's gp commitee , dr bryn john said : " i think the assembly is fully behind the release of the money , " he said .
jane hutt is reorganising the welsh nhs " but we feel that local decisions are being made by the health authority accountants or financial departments to deliberately deny this money . "
dr john recognised the need for money to be given to secondary services such as hospitals , but argued that gps also needed cash .
" if we want to develop primary care , we have to have more resources , " he said .
under a restructure instigated by assembly health minister jane hutt , the five existing health authorities will be abolished on 1 april 2003 .
in their place will be 22 local health boards -lrb- lhbs -rrb- which cover the same areas as local authorities .

the falun gong practitioners were refusing to pay the fines and were facing arrest .
it could probably be a falun gong follower or a sympathiser who hoped to save the convicted followers from further suppression kan hung-cheung falun gong spokesman the group had been convicted of causing an obstruction during a protest , but they said their convictions were unfair and are insisting they will still appeal against them .
the case was the first time criminal charges had been brought against members of the spiritual movement in hong kong .
the organisation is outlawed in china , but there are no laws against it in the former british colony .
human rights organisations have expressed concern that the case could indicate an erosion of freedoms which were promised hong kong after britain handed it back to chinese rule in 1997 .
identity unknown hong kong 's government had already begun preparing warrants for the arrests of the 16 falun gong practitioners when the anonymous donor stepped in .
those arrested included five foreigners the benefactor , whose identity is not even known to the falun gong members themselves , paid $ 4,000 worth of fines that had been imposed on them last week .
a spokeswoman from the hong kong judiciary , jaime or , could only say that an unidentified woman had stepped forward with the cash .
" it could probably be a falun gong follower or a sympathiser who hoped to save the convicted followers from further suppression , " falun gong spokesman kan hung-cheung said .
the 16 , who included four swiss followers , one from new zealand and 11 from hong kong , were facing up to two weeks in jail for refusing to pay the fines .
they had been convicted of causing an obstruction during a protest outside chinese central government offices in the territory .
political pressure mr kan said falun gong appreciated the gesture but were still planning to appeal against the convictions .
the falun gong members say the trial and sentences were politically motivated and legally flawed .
they have accused hong kong 's government of caving in to pressure from beijing and deliberately targeting their group .
before the trial , hong kong 's chief executive tung chee-hwa publicly labelled it an evil cult , repeating china 's official view of the movement .
the bbc 's hong kong correspondent damian grammaticas says there have been around 10,000 public protests in hong kong since it was returned to chinese sovereignty .
but that falun gong is one a tiny number of groups that have had charges brought against them for staging demonstrations .

the outlook is clouded by mixed signals rainer guntermann , economist promised tax-cuts have already been delayed in order to pay for the clean-up operations .

" indeed , indicators point to an acceleration in economic activity in the second half of the year . "

" expectations indexes have weakened , and i think growth will be weaker in the third quarter because of the flood .
" we wo n't see any positive effects from reconstruction until the fourth quarter . "

stable recovery there have been growing fears that the impact of this month 's damaging floods may tip the economy , which suffered recession during the last half of last year , back into a downturn . "
the outlook is clouded by mixed signals " rainer guntermann , economist promised tax-cuts have already been delayed in order to pay for the clean-up operations .
but the country 's finance ministry said the flooding would not damage economic expansion , and said it was sticking by a forecast of 0.75 % growth for the full year .
" the upward trend remains stable , " the ministry said .
" indeed , indicators point to an acceleration in economic activity in the second half of the year . "
but some analysts were not so confident .
" the outlook is clouded by mixed signals , " said rainer guntermann , an economist at dresdner kleinwort wasserstein , who forecast growth of 0.5 % this year .
" expectations indexes have weakened , and i think growth will be weaker in the third quarter because of the flood .
" we wo n't see any positive effects from reconstruction until the fourth quarter . "

he had just started a 12-week personal development training course at ystrad mynach college , which involved activities outside the classroom .

the glasgow cathcart msp sparked a political row when he criticised the £ 700m greater glasgow acute services review after it received the approval of health minister malcolm chisholm .
the tories and the scottish national party claim mr watson has breached the ministerial code of conduct by speaking out .
now the minister for tourism , culture and sport has defended his stance - and stressed that he will not be resigning over the issue .
speaking on bbc radio scotland , he said : " i have got a duty to campaign on behalf of the constituents of cathcart and they have made their views to me pretty clear .
" they have made their views clear to nhs greater glasgow and to the health minister . "
mr watson said he accepted that the decision had been taken by the scottish executive - but believed that his constituents expected him to express a view .
vote in parliament " i have two roles to play in this , " he said .
" i am a cabinet minister and i am also a constituency msp .
" i will accept the situation as far as the executive is concerned if it comes to a vote in parliament , i am bound by that . "
if he is to see this opposition through , if he is to be a real part of the campaign , then i think he must do that from the back benches " nicola sturgeon snp health spokeswoman " i do n't think i would serve any purpose by resigning . "
his comments came as opposition parties attempted to step up the pressure on mr watson .
tory leader david mcletchie told bbc scotland his party would table a motion calling for a review of the hospital proposals .
" if mr watson is so keen on standing up for his constituents he can sign and support our motion and debate , " he said .
he said the criticism of the decision was " quite clearly " a breach of the ministerial code .
hospital proposals " mike watson has undermined the whole principles on which government in this country has been conducted for decades .
" you can not have two ministers at odds with each other on such an important issue in the same cabinet , so one of them has to go , " he said .
snp health spokeswoman nicola sturgeon said she agreed with mr watson 's opposition to the hospital proposals .
however , said there was " a hint of hypocrisy " about his stance and argued that he could not have it both ways .
" if he is to see this opposition through , if he is to be a real part of the campaign , then i think he must do that from the back benches . "
mr watson in turn accused the opposition parties of " hypocrisy " over the row .
" if they are determined to bring this to the floor of the parliament to force a vote they are not doing this because they want the decision of nhs greater glasgow and malcolm chisholm overturned , that is not their main aim , " he said .
" their main issue is to embarrass the partnership and in particular the labour members . "
he added that he would be meeting nhs greater glasgow and mr chisholm next week to discuss the hospital proposals .
day care mr watson has spoken of his " bitter disappointment " that the centralisation plan. has been approved by the health minister .
the proposals have sparked anger in the south side of the city , where accident and emergency services will be concentrated at the southern general .
the victoria infirmary , which currently houses a & e facilities , is scheduled to become an ambulatory care and diagnostic hospital .
it is planned that patients will be seen , diagnosed and treated on a day care basis .
