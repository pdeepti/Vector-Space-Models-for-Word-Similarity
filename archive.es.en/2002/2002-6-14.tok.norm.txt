compared to its eastern european neighbors , it has the best chances of entering the eu by the 2004 accession deadline . in 1989 hungary made a dramatic first step .
several months before the berlin wall fell , the hungarian government opened its borders to austria and the west , enabling thousands of east germans to flee across the iron curtain .
within less than a year germany was re-united , hungary had elected its first democratic government , and europe was on the way to erasing the east-west divide .
twelve years later , the iron curtain has all but disappeared .
in its place a new border has risen separating the european union member countries from their non-eu neighbors .
many of them are candidates for eu-membership . hungary is on the edge of that border .
by 2004 , however , it hopes to again make a dramatic move and become the first of the former eastern european countries to join the eu .
fast-paced tempo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rally in budapest , hungary so far the country is right on schedule , and if everything continues according to plan , hungary will be finished with all the necessary accession negotiations by the end of 2002 .
this is a fast-track plan , and one which suits the hungarian people just fine .
when asked how they feel about joining the eu , most hungarians say they can ’ t wait for it to take place .
it should have happened yesterday , many will say as they point to their country ’ s rapid economic development since the end of the cold war .
in just over twelve years , hungary has managed to completely turn around its staid socialist economy .
the government has pushed through a quick-paced liberalization of the market .
the energy , banking and telecommunication sectors have all been thoroughly privatized .
since 1997 , the economy has grown at a consistent rate of between four to five percent per year .
and unemployment has evened out to 5.6 percent , one of the lowest rates of all candidate countries .
with a little help from friends from audi and volkswagen to general electrics and siemens , nearly 30,000 foreign firms currently operate in hungary , churning out products for the country ’ s growing export markets .
since 1989 , the export volume has increased by more than 50 percent .
in 2001 , 65 percent of all trade was with the european union , 45 percent of which was with germany alone .
over the course of the last few years , international companies have poured in some 911 billion euro -lrb- $ 839 billion -rrb- in foreign investment and created thousands of jobs where there were none before .
this direct foreign investment is the highest per capita of all central and eastern european countries , and accounts for a good percentage of hungary ’ s overall economic growth .
economic success story anton kunszt , head of the german economic club in budapest , points to the high level of qualified labor and a good infrastructure as explanations for hungary ’ s economic success .
compared to other eastern european countries , hungary also has a stable government and a flexible economy .
kunszt says the economy and government are responsive to the needs of multi-national corporations , and that politicians understand how important foreign investment is for the nation ’ s economic success .
even if foreign companies buy up the majority of hungarian businesses and enjoy significant tax abatements -lrb- some are even tax free for over ten years -rrb- , most of the country sees it as a positive development .
where else would the money come from , the people ask themselves .
kunszt , who was born in hungary but left the country in the 1970s and returned again in the early 1990s , believes the country is on the right road to eu accession .
" i don ’ t think hungary is any less prepared now than spain or portugal were back when they entered the eu " , he says praising his homeland ’ s economic progress in the last few years .
private vs. public hungary ’ s economic success can be most clearly measured in the strong private sector growth .
here , the country is undoubtedly on the path to fast-track acceptance in the eu .
but when it comes to the public sector , hungary still has a ways to go .
all the economic growth and the investment has been solely in the private arena , says istvan bajko , a german teacher at the state business college in budapest .
public facilities and institutions are not much better off than they were at the end of 1989 .
" in the last ten years , the private sector has enjoyed strong development – especially thanks to the capital flowing in from western europe .
but the state sector – the health system , the education system , and so on – these all have a great deal of problems , " bajko comments while he stands in the middle of a run-down school room with an ancient chinese computer .
the national health care system , for instance , is so bankrupt , that hospital patients are asked to bring their own toilet paper and place settings -lrb- flat ware and dishes -rrb- for any meals they take while undergoing treatment .
where does all the money go ?
when it comes to wage earnings , only those fortunate enough to work for a big international company profit from hungary ’ s economic success .
state employees , such as teachers and doctors , earn far below what an assembly line worker at one of the foreign automobile manufacturers makes .
and many people are forced to take on two jobs just to make ends meet .
the standard of living and the cost of rent has risen parallel to the increase in foreign investment over the past few years .
it seems , the more foreign companies come to hungary , the better the goods in the store are , and the more expensive life becomes .
not everyone has profited from the country ’ s economic success .
in fact , since so many foreign corporations are excused from paying taxes , there is no real correlation between the number of international businesses and an increase in state income .
for those areas relying heavily on state support -lrb- health care , education , transportation , safety -rrb- , there has been no real visible benefit from the increase in foreign presence .
nonetheless , most hungarians are looking forward to being part of the eu .
they see accession as an improvement in their lives .
bajko says he hopes that joining the eu will bring a higher level of standards across the board , both private and public .
" i hope that the standards will rise .
one can not be a member of the eu and neglect the public sector – not to the extent it ’ s happened here .
financially , the public sector is not so far along as the private industry .
but in a couple of years , i hope this will change . "
learning patience hungary will most likely enter the eu in 2004 , and may even be one of the first candidate countries to do so .
but not all of the desired improvements will take place right away .
the hungarians will have to learn to be patient , and to wait out the change .
wilhelm droste , a coffee house owner and poet in budapest , says the hungarians were always impatient , and wanted things to happen as quickly as possible .
" it ’ s probably the same situation in all of eastern europe , " he says pragmatically .
" somehow the people managed the leap to a capitalist society , and now everyone considers themselves an ‘ almost western european ’ .
but now we see how long people can hang in the air before they come down from that initial leap , and no one really knows where they will land .
and that ’ s the difficult part about it - the waiting and the uncertainty .

since 1989 , the export volume has increased by more than 50 percent .
in 2001 , 65 percent of all trade was with the european union , 45 percent of which was with germany alone .
over the course of the last few years , international companies have poured in some 911 billion euro -lrb- $ 839 billion -rrb- in foreign investment and created thousands of jobs where there were none before .
this direct foreign investment is the highest per capita of all central and eastern european countries , and accounts for a good percentage of hungary ’ s overall economic growth .
economic success story anton kunszt , head of the german economic club in budapest , points to the high level of qualified labor and a good infrastructure as explanations for hungary ’ s economic success .
compared to other eastern european countries , hungary also has a stable government and a flexible economy .
kunszt says the economy and government are responsive to the needs of multi-national corporations , and that politicians understand how important foreign investment is for the nation ’ s economic success .
even if foreign companies buy up the majority of hungarian businesses and enjoy significant tax abatements -lrb- some are even tax free for over ten years -rrb- , most of the country sees it as a positive development .
where else would the money come from , the people ask themselves .
kunszt , who was born in hungary but left the country in the 1970s and returned again in the early 1990s , believes the country is on the right road to eu accession .
" i don ’ t think hungary is any less prepared now than spain or portugal were back when they entered the eu " , he says praising his homeland ’ s economic progress in the last few years .
private vs. public hungary ’ s economic success can be most clearly measured in the strong private sector growth .
here , the country is undoubtedly on the path to fast-track acceptance in the eu .
but when it comes to the public sector , hungary still has a ways to go .
all the economic growth and the investment has been solely in the private arena , says istvan bajko , a german teacher at the state business college in budapest .
public facilities and institutions are not much better off than they were at the end of 1989 .
" in the last ten years , the private sector has enjoyed strong development – especially thanks to the capital flowing in from western europe .
but the state sector – the health system , the education system , and so on – these all have a great deal of problems , " bajko comments while he stands in the middle of a run-down school room with an ancient chinese computer .
the national health care system , for instance , is so bankrupt , that hospital patients are asked to bring their own toilet paper and place settings -lrb- flat ware and dishes -rrb- for any meals they take while undergoing treatment .
where does all the money go ?
when it comes to wage earnings , only those fortunate enough to work for a big international company profit from hungary ’ s economic success .
state employees , such as teachers and doctors , earn far below what an assembly line worker at one of the foreign automobile manufacturers makes .
and many people are forced to take on two jobs just to make ends meet .
the standard of living and the cost of rent has risen parallel to the increase in foreign investment over the past few years .
it seems , the more foreign companies come to hungary , the better the goods in the store are , and the more expensive life becomes .
not everyone has profited from the country ’ s economic success .
in fact , since so many foreign corporations are excused from paying taxes , there is no real correlation between the number of international businesses and an increase in state income .
for those areas relying heavily on state support -lrb- health care , education , transportation , safety -rrb- , there has been no real visible benefit from the increase in foreign presence .
nonetheless , most hungarians are looking forward to being part of the eu .
they see accession as an improvement in their lives .
bajko says he hopes that joining the eu will bring a higher level of standards across the board , both private and public .
" i hope that the standards will rise .
one can not be a member of the eu and neglect the public sector – not to the extent it ’ s happened here .
financially , the public sector is not so far along as the private industry .
but in a couple of years , i hope this will change . "
learning patience hungary will most likely enter the eu in 2004 , and may even be one of the first candidate countries to do so .
but not all of the desired improvements will take place right away .
the hungarians will have to learn to be patient , and to wait out the change .
wilhelm droste , a coffee house owner and poet in budapest , says the hungarians were always impatient , and wanted things to happen as quickly as possible .
" it ’ s probably the same situation in all of eastern europe , " he says pragmatically .
" somehow the people managed the leap to a capitalist society , and now everyone considers themselves an ‘ almost western european ’ .
but now we see how long people can hang in the air before they come down from that initial leap , and no one really knows where they will land .
and that ’ s the difficult part about it - the waiting and the uncertainty .

compared to its eastern european neighbors , it has the best chances of entering the eu by the 2004 accession deadline . in 1989 hungary made a dramatic first step .
several months before the berlin wall fell , the hungarian government opened its borders to austria and the west , enabling thousands of east germans to flee across the iron curtain .
within less than a year germany was re-united , hungary had elected its first democratic government , and europe was on the way to erasing the east-west divide .
twelve years later , the iron curtain has all but disappeared .
in its place a new border has risen separating the european union member countries from their non-eu neighbors .
many of them are candidates for eu-membership . hungary is on the edge of that border .
by 2004 , however , it hopes to again make a dramatic move and become the first of the former eastern european countries to join the eu .
fast-paced tempo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rally in budapest , hungary so far the country is right on schedule , and if everything continues according to plan , hungary will be finished with all the necessary accession negotiations by the end of 2002 .
this is a fast-track plan , and one which suits the hungarian people just fine .
when asked how they feel about joining the eu , most hungarians say they can ’ t wait for it to take place .
it should have happened yesterday , many will say as they point to their country ’ s rapid economic development since the end of the cold war .
in just over twelve years , hungary has managed to completely turn around its staid socialist economy .
the government has pushed through a quick-paced liberalization of the market .
the energy , banking and telecommunication sectors have all been thoroughly privatized .
since 1997 , the economy has grown at a consistent rate of between four to five percent per year .

compared to its eastern european neighbors , it has the best chances of entering the eu by the 2004 accession deadline . in 1989 hungary made a dramatic first step .
several months before the berlin wall fell , the hungarian government opened its borders to austria and the west , enabling thousands of east germans to flee across the iron curtain .
within less than a year germany was re-united , hungary had elected its first democratic government , and europe was on the way to erasing the east-west divide .
twelve years later , the iron curtain has all but disappeared .
in its place a new border has risen separating the european union member countries from their non-eu neighbors .
many of them are candidates for eu-membership . hungary is on the edge of that border .
by 2004 , however , it hopes to again make a dramatic move and become the first of the former eastern european countries to join the eu .
fast-paced tempo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rally in budapest , hungary so far the country is right on schedule , and if everything continues according to plan , hungary will be finished with all the necessary accession negotiations by the end of 2002 .
this is a fast-track plan , and one which suits the hungarian people just fine .
when asked how they feel about joining the eu , most hungarians say they can ’ t wait for it to take place .
it should have happened yesterday , many will say as they point to their country ’ s rapid economic development since the end of the cold war .
in just over twelve years , hungary has managed to completely turn around its staid socialist economy .
the government has pushed through a quick-paced liberalization of the market .
the energy , banking and telecommunication sectors have all been thoroughly privatized .
since 1997 , the economy has grown at a consistent rate of between four to five percent per year .
and unemployment has evened out to 5.6 percent , one of the lowest rates of all candidate countries .
with a little help from friends from audi and volkswagen to general electrics and siemens , nearly 30,000 foreign firms currently operate in hungary , churning out products for the country ’ s growing export markets .
since 1989 , the export volume has increased by more than 50 percent .
in 2001 , 65 percent of all trade was with the european union , 45 percent of which was with germany alone .
over the course of the last few years , international companies have poured in some 911 billion euro -lrb- $ 839 billion -rrb- in foreign investment and created thousands of jobs where there were none before .
this direct foreign investment is the highest per capita of all central and eastern european countries , and accounts for a good percentage of hungary ’ s overall economic growth .
economic success story anton kunszt , head of the german economic club in budapest , points to the high level of qualified labor and a good infrastructure as explanations for hungary ’ s economic success .
compared to other eastern european countries , hungary also has a stable government and a flexible economy .
kunszt says the economy and government are responsive to the needs of multi-national corporations , and that politicians understand how important foreign investment is for the nation ’ s economic success .
even if foreign companies buy up the majority of hungarian businesses and enjoy significant tax abatements -lrb- some are even tax free for over ten years -rrb- , most of the country sees it as a positive development .
where else would the money come from , the people ask themselves .
kunszt , who was born in hungary but left the country in the 1970s and returned again in the early 1990s , believes the country is on the right road to eu accession .
" i don ’ t think hungary is any less prepared now than spain or portugal were back when they entered the eu " , he says praising his homeland ’ s economic progress in the last few years .
private vs. public hungary ’ s economic success can be most clearly measured in the strong private sector growth .
here , the country is undoubtedly on the path to fast-track acceptance in the eu .
but when it comes to the public sector , hungary still has a ways to go .
all the economic growth and the investment has been solely in the private arena , says istvan bajko , a german teacher at the state business college in budapest .
public facilities and institutions are not much better off than they were at the end of 1989 .
" in the last ten years , the private sector has enjoyed strong development – especially thanks to the capital flowing in from western europe .
but the state sector – the health system , the education system , and so on – these all have a great deal of problems , " bajko comments while he stands in the middle of a run-down school room with an ancient chinese computer .
the national health care system , for instance , is so bankrupt , that hospital patients are asked to bring their own toilet paper and place settings -lrb- flat ware and dishes -rrb- for any meals they take while undergoing treatment .
where does all the money go ?
when it comes to wage earnings , only those fortunate enough to work for a big international company profit from hungary ’ s economic success .
state employees , such as teachers and doctors , earn far below what an assembly line worker at one of the foreign automobile manufacturers makes .
and many people are forced to take on two jobs just to make ends meet .
the standard of living and the cost of rent has risen parallel to the increase in foreign investment over the past few years .
it seems , the more foreign companies come to hungary , the better the goods in the store are , and the more expensive life becomes .
not everyone has profited from the country ’ s economic success .
in fact , since so many foreign corporations are excused from paying taxes , there is no real correlation between the number of international businesses and an increase in state income .

compared to its eastern european neighbors , it has the best chances of entering the eu by the 2004 accession deadline . in 1989 hungary made a dramatic first step .
several months before the berlin wall fell , the hungarian government opened its borders to austria and the west , enabling thousands of east germans to flee across the iron curtain .
within less than a year germany was re-united , hungary had elected its first democratic government , and europe was on the way to erasing the east-west divide .
twelve years later , the iron curtain has all but disappeared .
in its place a new border has risen separating the european union member countries from their non-eu neighbors .
many of them are candidates for eu-membership . hungary is on the edge of that border .
by 2004 , however , it hopes to again make a dramatic move and become the first of the former eastern european countries to join the eu .
fast-paced tempo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rally in budapest , hungary so far the country is right on schedule , and if everything continues according to plan , hungary will be finished with all the necessary accession negotiations by the end of 2002 .
this is a fast-track plan , and one which suits the hungarian people just fine .
when asked how they feel about joining the eu , most hungarians say they can ’ t wait for it to take place .
it should have happened yesterday , many will say as they point to their country ’ s rapid economic development since the end of the cold war .
in just over twelve years , hungary has managed to completely turn around its staid socialist economy .
the government has pushed through a quick-paced liberalization of the market .
the energy , banking and telecommunication sectors have all been thoroughly privatized .
since 1997 , the economy has grown at a consistent rate of between four to five percent per year .
and unemployment has evened out to 5.6 percent , one of the lowest rates of all candidate countries .
with a little help from friends from audi and volkswagen to general electrics and siemens , nearly 30,000 foreign firms currently operate in hungary , churning out products for the country ’ s growing export markets .
since 1989 , the export volume has increased by more than 50 percent .
in 2001 , 65 percent of all trade was with the european union , 45 percent of which was with germany alone .
over the course of the last few years , international companies have poured in some 911 billion euro -lrb- $ 839 billion -rrb- in foreign investment and created thousands of jobs where there were none before .
this direct foreign investment is the highest per capita of all central and eastern european countries , and accounts for a good percentage of hungary ’ s overall economic growth .
economic success story anton kunszt , head of the german economic club in budapest , points to the high level of qualified labor and a good infrastructure as explanations for hungary ’ s economic success .
compared to other eastern european countries , hungary also has a stable government and a flexible economy .
kunszt says the economy and government are responsive to the needs of multi-national corporations , and that politicians understand how important foreign investment is for the nation ’ s economic success .
even if foreign companies buy up the majority of hungarian businesses and enjoy significant tax abatements -lrb- some are even tax free for over ten years -rrb- , most of the country sees it as a positive development .
where else would the money come from , the people ask themselves .
kunszt , who was born in hungary but left the country in the 1970s and returned again in the early 1990s , believes the country is on the right road to eu accession .
" i don ’ t think hungary is any less prepared now than spain or portugal were back when they entered the eu " , he says praising his homeland ’ s economic progress in the last few years .
private vs. public hungary ’ s economic success can be most clearly measured in the strong private sector growth .
here , the country is undoubtedly on the path to fast-track acceptance in the eu .
but when it comes to the public sector , hungary still has a ways to go .
all the economic growth and the investment has been solely in the private arena , says istvan bajko , a german teacher at the state business college in budapest .
public facilities and institutions are not much better off than they were at the end of 1989 .
" in the last ten years , the private sector has enjoyed strong development – especially thanks to the capital flowing in from western europe .
but the state sector – the health system , the education system , and so on – these all have a great deal of problems , " bajko comments while he stands in the middle of a run-down school room with an ancient chinese computer .
the national health care system , for instance , is so bankrupt , that hospital patients are asked to bring their own toilet paper and place settings -lrb- flat ware and dishes -rrb- for any meals they take while undergoing treatment .
where does all the money go ?
when it comes to wage earnings , only those fortunate enough to work for a big international company profit from hungary ’ s economic success .
state employees , such as teachers and doctors , earn far below what an assembly line worker at one of the foreign automobile manufacturers makes .
and many people are forced to take on two jobs just to make ends meet .
the standard of living and the cost of rent has risen parallel to the increase in foreign investment over the past few years .
it seems , the more foreign companies come to hungary , the better the goods in the store are , and the more expensive life becomes .
not everyone has profited from the country ’ s economic success .
in fact , since so many foreign corporations are excused from paying taxes , there is no real correlation between the number of international businesses and an increase in state income .
for those areas relying heavily on state support -lrb- health care , education , transportation , safety -rrb- , there has been no real visible benefit from the increase in foreign presence .
nonetheless , most hungarians are looking forward to being part of the eu .
they see accession as an improvement in their lives .
bajko says he hopes that joining the eu will bring a higher level of standards across the board , both private and public .
" i hope that the standards will rise .
one can not be a member of the eu and neglect the public sector – not to the extent it ’ s happened here .
financially , the public sector is not so far along as the private industry .
but in a couple of years , i hope this will change . "
learning patience hungary will most likely enter the eu in 2004 , and may even be one of the first candidate countries to do so .
but not all of the desired improvements will take place right away .
the hungarians will have to learn to be patient , and to wait out the change .
wilhelm droste , a coffee house owner and poet in budapest , says the hungarians were always impatient , and wanted things to happen as quickly as possible .
" it ’ s probably the same situation in all of eastern europe , " he says pragmatically .
" somehow the people managed the leap to a capitalist society , and now everyone considers themselves an ‘ almost western european ’ .
but now we see how long people can hang in the air before they come down from that initial leap , and no one really knows where they will land .
and that ’ s the difficult part about it - the waiting and the uncertainty .

with a little help from friends from audi and volkswagen to general electrics and siemens , nearly 30,000 foreign firms currently operate in hungary , churning out products for the country ’ s growing export markets .
since 1989 , the export volume has increased by more than 50 percent .
in 2001 , 65 percent of all trade was with the european union , 45 percent of which was with germany alone .
over the course of the last few years , international companies have poured in some 911 billion euro -lrb- $ 839 billion -rrb- in foreign investment and created thousands of jobs where there were none before .
this direct foreign investment is the highest per capita of all central and eastern european countries , and accounts for a good percentage of hungary ’ s overall economic growth .
economic success story anton kunszt , head of the german economic club in budapest , points to the high level of qualified labor and a good infrastructure as explanations for hungary ’ s economic success .
compared to other eastern european countries , hungary also has a stable government and a flexible economy .
kunszt says the economy and government are responsive to the needs of multi-national corporations , and that politicians understand how important foreign investment is for the nation ’ s economic success .
even if foreign companies buy up the majority of hungarian businesses and enjoy significant tax abatements -lrb- some are even tax free for over ten years -rrb- , most of the country sees it as a positive development .
where else would the money come from , the people ask themselves .
kunszt , who was born in hungary but left the country in the 1970s and returned again in the early 1990s , believes the country is on the right road to eu accession .
" i don ’ t think hungary is any less prepared now than spain or portugal were back when they entered the eu " , he says praising his homeland ’ s economic progress in the last few years .
private vs. public hungary ’ s economic success can be most clearly measured in the strong private sector growth .
here , the country is undoubtedly on the path to fast-track acceptance in the eu .
but when it comes to the public sector , hungary still has a ways to go .
all the economic growth and the investment has been solely in the private arena , says istvan bajko , a german teacher at the state business college in budapest .
public facilities and institutions are not much better off than they were at the end of 1989 .
" in the last ten years , the private sector has enjoyed strong development – especially thanks to the capital flowing in from western europe .
but the state sector – the health system , the education system , and so on – these all have a great deal of problems , " bajko comments while he stands in the middle of a run-down school room with an ancient chinese computer .
the national health care system , for instance , is so bankrupt , that hospital patients are asked to bring their own toilet paper and place settings -lrb- flat ware and dishes -rrb- for any meals they take while undergoing treatment .
where does all the money go ?
when it comes to wage earnings , only those fortunate enough to work for a big international company profit from hungary ’ s economic success .
state employees , such as teachers and doctors , earn far below what an assembly line worker at one of the foreign automobile manufacturers makes .
and many people are forced to take on two jobs just to make ends meet .
the standard of living and the cost of rent has risen parallel to the increase in foreign investment over the past few years .
it seems , the more foreign companies come to hungary , the better the goods in the store are , and the more expensive life becomes .
not everyone has profited from the country ’ s economic success .
in fact , since so many foreign corporations are excused from paying taxes , there is no real correlation between the number of international businesses and an increase in state income .
for those areas relying heavily on state support -lrb- health care , education , transportation , safety -rrb- , there has been no real visible benefit from the increase in foreign presence .
nonetheless , most hungarians are looking forward to being part of the eu .
they see accession as an improvement in their lives .
bajko says he hopes that joining the eu will bring a higher level of standards across the board , both private and public .
" i hope that the standards will rise .
one can not be a member of the eu and neglect the public sector – not to the extent it ’ s happened here .
financially , the public sector is not so far along as the private industry .
but in a couple of years , i hope this will change . "
learning patience hungary will most likely enter the eu in 2004 , and may even be one of the first candidate countries to do so .
but not all of the desired improvements will take place right away .
the hungarians will have to learn to be patient , and to wait out the change .
wilhelm droste , a coffee house owner and poet in budapest , says the hungarians were always impatient , and wanted things to happen as quickly as possible .
" it ’ s probably the same situation in all of eastern europe , " he says pragmatically .
" somehow the people managed the leap to a capitalist society , and now everyone considers themselves an ‘ almost western european ’ .
but now we see how long people can hang in the air before they come down from that initial leap , and no one really knows where they will land .
and that ’ s the difficult part about it - the waiting and the uncertainty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.06.2002 is the fdp channelling haider ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are jürgen möllemann and guido westerwelle surfing europe 's right-wing wave ?
in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guidomobil in order to gain younger voters , westerwelle created the mtv-style guidomobil motorhome that is traversing germany ; he brought in porno star dolly buster to campaign on the fdp 's behalf ; and he made an appearance on the popular " big brother " tv show last year .
though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .
they still could have mobilized potential voters from the right " without seriously damaging the fdp 's political credentials , he says .
now , it 's too late .
even if the opposition christian democrats and christian social union score big in the election , it is unlikely westerwelle will be given the traditional junior-coalition partner cabinet post of foreign minister . and after his political stumbling , there will be little room for möllemann in a coalition government .
" the cdu does n't want someone like möllemann in their cabinet , " says lösche , " you just ca n't predict what he 's going to do .

after the african cup winners cameroon and former olympic champions nigeria self destructed , the erratic but explosive senegalese will be the continent 's sole competitors in the latter stages .
their combination of flair and unpredicatability will no doubt cause the rigid swedes problems when they meet on sunday .
and who would rule out an asian champion ?

in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guidomobil in order to gain younger voters , westerwelle created the mtv-style guidomobil motorhome that is traversing germany ; he brought in porno star dolly buster to campaign on the fdp 's behalf ; and he made an appearance on the popular " big brother " tv show last year .
though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .
they still could have mobilized potential voters from the right " without seriously damaging the fdp 's political credentials , he says .
now , it 's too late .
even if the opposition christian democrats and christian social union score big in the election , it is unlikely westerwelle will be given the traditional junior-coalition partner cabinet post of foreign minister . and after his political stumbling , there will be little room for möllemann in a coalition government .
" the cdu does n't want someone like möllemann in their cabinet , " says lösche , " you just ca n't predict what he 's going to do .

but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guidomobil in order to gain younger voters , westerwelle created the mtv-style guidomobil motorhome that is traversing germany ; he brought in porno star dolly buster to campaign on the fdp 's behalf ; and he made an appearance on the popular " big brother " tv show last year .
though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .
they still could have mobilized potential voters from the right " without seriously damaging the fdp 's political credentials , he says .
now , it 's too late .
even if the opposition christian democrats and christian social union score big in the election , it is unlikely westerwelle will be given the traditional junior-coalition partner cabinet post of foreign minister . and after his political stumbling , there will be little room for möllemann in a coalition government .
" the cdu does n't want someone like möllemann in their cabinet , " says lösche , " you just ca n't predict what he 's going to do .

could there be a champion among them ? this world cup , more than any other , has shown a lack of respect for history and myth .
first world and european champions france , then heavily-favored argentina fell to the likes of senegal and sweden and took early leave of the tournament .
from the moment the championships opened with a form-shattering 1-0 win for the africans over the french , the hierarchy of international football has been rocked by a series of mini revolutions that could quite possibly result in a major coup come july .
lacklustre french defence of trophy starts the upheaval les bleus eventually crashed out after capitulating to another set of rising stars in this world cup , denmark .
the 2-0 score line showed another shift in power ; france had not scored a single goal despite fielding the top scorers from the english , french and italian leagues as their strike force .
meanwhile the danes scored more goals in one match against the out-going champions than the french managed in the whole tournament .
strong and well organised , the danish could well be outsiders with championship credentials .

big noises were made of the challenge of argentina this time around .
with an expensive and talented squad , the south american millionaires followed up an unconvincing win against nigeria with a 1-0 defeat by england .
another team of strong scandinavians rocked argentina 's world when , five days later , sweden held them to a 1-1 draw , leaving only time for tears and packing before catching the flight home .
other big names have been scared witless by teams on the rise .
italy had to rely on an 85th minute equaliser from alessandro del piero against mexico to secure their passage to the next round .
african minnows exceed expectations so who will challenge the remainding big guns as the knockout stages kick off on saturday ?
it would be a good bet that senegal will continue to do their best to fulfil pele ’ s prophecy that an african winner is just around the corner .
after the african cup winners cameroon and former olympic champions nigeria self destructed , the erratic but explosive senegalese will be the continent 's sole competitors in the latter stages .
their combination of flair and unpredicatability will no doubt cause the rigid swedes problems when they meet on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe in transition romania — still a long way to go poland 's limp into the eu the czech republic - a bumpy ride into the eu lithuania 's search for security europe -pipe- 14.06.2002 hungary : a country of firsts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital budapest in the round-up of eu candidate countries , hungary is a country of firsts .
compared to its eastern european neighbors , it has the best chances of entering the eu by the 2004 accession deadline . in 1989 hungary made a dramatic first step .
several months before the berlin wall fell , the hungarian government opened its borders to austria and the west , enabling thousands of east germans to flee across the iron curtain .
within less than a year germany was re-united , hungary had elected its first democratic government , and europe was on the way to erasing the east-west divide .
twelve years later , the iron curtain has all but disappeared .
in its place a new border has risen separating the european union member countries from their non-eu neighbors .
many of them are candidates for eu-membership . hungary is on the edge of that border .
by 2004 , however , it hopes to again make a dramatic move and become the first of the former eastern european countries to join the eu .
fast-paced tempo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rally in budapest , hungary so far the country is right on schedule , and if everything continues according to plan , hungary will be finished with all the necessary accession negotiations by the end of 2002 .
this is a fast-track plan , and one which suits the hungarian people just fine .
when asked how they feel about joining the eu , most hungarians say they can ’ t wait for it to take place .
it should have happened yesterday , many will say as they point to their country ’ s rapid economic development since the end of the cold war .
in just over twelve years , hungary has managed to completely turn around its staid socialist economy .
the government has pushed through a quick-paced liberalization of the market .
the energy , banking and telecommunication sectors have all been thoroughly privatized .
since 1997 , the economy has grown at a consistent rate of between four to five percent per year .
and unemployment has evened out to 5.6 percent , one of the lowest rates of all candidate countries .
with a little help from friends from audi and volkswagen to general electrics and siemens , nearly 30,000 foreign firms currently operate in hungary , churning out products for the country ’ s growing export markets .
since 1989 , the export volume has increased by more than 50 percent .
in 2001 , 65 percent of all trade was with the european union , 45 percent of which was with germany alone .
over the course of the last few years , international companies have poured in some 911 billion euro -lrb- $ 839 billion -rrb- in foreign investment and created thousands of jobs where there were none before .
this direct foreign investment is the highest per capita of all central and eastern european countries , and accounts for a good percentage of hungary ’ s overall economic growth .
economic success story anton kunszt , head of the german economic club in budapest , points to the high level of qualified labor and a good infrastructure as explanations for hungary ’ s economic success .
compared to other eastern european countries , hungary also has a stable government and a flexible economy .
kunszt says the economy and government are responsive to the needs of multi-national corporations , and that politicians understand how important foreign investment is for the nation ’ s economic success .
even if foreign companies buy up the majority of hungarian businesses and enjoy significant tax abatements -lrb- some are even tax free for over ten years -rrb- , most of the country sees it as a positive development .
where else would the money come from , the people ask themselves .
kunszt , who was born in hungary but left the country in the 1970s and returned again in the early 1990s , believes the country is on the right road to eu accession .
" i don ’ t think hungary is any less prepared now than spain or portugal were back when they entered the eu " , he says praising his homeland ’ s economic progress in the last few years .
private vs. public hungary ’ s economic success can be most clearly measured in the strong private sector growth .
here , the country is undoubtedly on the path to fast-track acceptance in the eu .
but when it comes to the public sector , hungary still has a ways to go .
all the economic growth and the investment has been solely in the private arena , says istvan bajko , a german teacher at the state business college in budapest .
public facilities and institutions are not much better off than they were at the end of 1989 .
" in the last ten years , the private sector has enjoyed strong development – especially thanks to the capital flowing in from western europe .
but the state sector – the health system , the education system , and so on – these all have a great deal of problems , " bajko comments while he stands in the middle of a run-down school room with an ancient chinese computer .
the national health care system , for instance , is so bankrupt , that hospital patients are asked to bring their own toilet paper and place settings -lrb- flat ware and dishes -rrb- for any meals they take while undergoing treatment .
where does all the money go ?
when it comes to wage earnings , only those fortunate enough to work for a big international company profit from hungary ’ s economic success .
state employees , such as teachers and doctors , earn far below what an assembly line worker at one of the foreign automobile manufacturers makes .
and many people are forced to take on two jobs just to make ends meet .
the standard of living and the cost of rent has risen parallel to the increase in foreign investment over the past few years .
it seems , the more foreign companies come to hungary , the better the goods in the store are , and the more expensive life becomes .
not everyone has profited from the country ’ s economic success .
in fact , since so many foreign corporations are excused from paying taxes , there is no real correlation between the number of international businesses and an increase in state income .
for those areas relying heavily on state support -lrb- health care , education , transportation , safety -rrb- , there has been no real visible benefit from the increase in foreign presence .
nonetheless , most hungarians are looking forward to being part of the eu .
they see accession as an improvement in their lives .
bajko says he hopes that joining the eu will bring a higher level of standards across the board , both private and public .
" i hope that the standards will rise .
one can not be a member of the eu and neglect the public sector – not to the extent it ’ s happened here .
financially , the public sector is not so far along as the private industry .
but in a couple of years , i hope this will change . "
learning patience hungary will most likely enter the eu in 2004 , and may even be one of the first candidate countries to do so .
but not all of the desired improvements will take place right away .
the hungarians will have to learn to be patient , and to wait out the change .
wilhelm droste , a coffee house owner and poet in budapest , says the hungarians were always impatient , and wanted things to happen as quickly as possible .
" it ’ s probably the same situation in all of eastern europe , " he says pragmatically .
" somehow the people managed the leap to a capitalist society , and now everyone considers themselves an ‘ almost western european ’ .
but now we see how long people can hang in the air before they come down from that initial leap , and no one really knows where they will land .
and that ’ s the difficult part about it - the waiting and the uncertainty .

within less than a year germany was re-united , hungary had elected its first democratic government , and europe was on the way to erasing the east-west divide .
twelve years later , the iron curtain has all but disappeared .
in its place a new border has risen separating the european union member countries from their non-eu neighbors .
many of them are candidates for eu-membership . hungary is on the edge of that border .
by 2004 , however , it hopes to again make a dramatic move and become the first of the former eastern european countries to join the eu .
fast-paced tempo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rally in budapest , hungary so far the country is right on schedule , and if everything continues according to plan , hungary will be finished with all the necessary accession negotiations by the end of 2002 .
this is a fast-track plan , and one which suits the hungarian people just fine .
when asked how they feel about joining the eu , most hungarians say they can ’ t wait for it to take place .
it should have happened yesterday , many will say as they point to their country ’ s rapid economic development since the end of the cold war .
in just over twelve years , hungary has managed to completely turn around its staid socialist economy .
the government has pushed through a quick-paced liberalization of the market .
the energy , banking and telecommunication sectors have all been thoroughly privatized .
since 1997 , the economy has grown at a consistent rate of between four to five percent per year .
and unemployment has evened out to 5.6 percent , one of the lowest rates of all candidate countries .
with a little help from friends from audi and volkswagen to general electrics and siemens , nearly 30,000 foreign firms currently operate in hungary , churning out products for the country ’ s growing export markets .
since 1989 , the export volume has increased by more than 50 percent .
in 2001 , 65 percent of all trade was with the european union , 45 percent of which was with germany alone .
over the course of the last few years , international companies have poured in some 911 billion euro -lrb- $ 839 billion -rrb- in foreign investment and created thousands of jobs where there were none before .
this direct foreign investment is the highest per capita of all central and eastern european countries , and accounts for a good percentage of hungary ’ s overall economic growth .
economic success story anton kunszt , head of the german economic club in budapest , points to the high level of qualified labor and a good infrastructure as explanations for hungary ’ s economic success .
compared to other eastern european countries , hungary also has a stable government and a flexible economy .
kunszt says the economy and government are responsive to the needs of multi-national corporations , and that politicians understand how important foreign investment is for the nation ’ s economic success .
even if foreign companies buy up the majority of hungarian businesses and enjoy significant tax abatements -lrb- some are even tax free for over ten years -rrb- , most of the country sees it as a positive development .
where else would the money come from , the people ask themselves .
kunszt , who was born in hungary but left the country in the 1970s and returned again in the early 1990s , believes the country is on the right road to eu accession .
" i don ’ t think hungary is any less prepared now than spain or portugal were back when they entered the eu " , he says praising his homeland ’ s economic progress in the last few years .
private vs. public hungary ’ s economic success can be most clearly measured in the strong private sector growth .
here , the country is undoubtedly on the path to fast-track acceptance in the eu .
but when it comes to the public sector , hungary still has a ways to go .
all the economic growth and the investment has been solely in the private arena , says istvan bajko , a german teacher at the state business college in budapest .
public facilities and institutions are not much better off than they were at the end of 1989 .
" in the last ten years , the private sector has enjoyed strong development – especially thanks to the capital flowing in from western europe .
but the state sector – the health system , the education system , and so on – these all have a great deal of problems , " bajko comments while he stands in the middle of a run-down school room with an ancient chinese computer .
the national health care system , for instance , is so bankrupt , that hospital patients are asked to bring their own toilet paper and place settings -lrb- flat ware and dishes -rrb- for any meals they take while undergoing treatment .
where does all the money go ?
when it comes to wage earnings , only those fortunate enough to work for a big international company profit from hungary ’ s economic success .
state employees , such as teachers and doctors , earn far below what an assembly line worker at one of the foreign automobile manufacturers makes .
and many people are forced to take on two jobs just to make ends meet .
the standard of living and the cost of rent has risen parallel to the increase in foreign investment over the past few years .
it seems , the more foreign companies come to hungary , the better the goods in the store are , and the more expensive life becomes .
not everyone has profited from the country ’ s economic success .
in fact , since so many foreign corporations are excused from paying taxes , there is no real correlation between the number of international businesses and an increase in state income .
for those areas relying heavily on state support -lrb- health care , education , transportation , safety -rrb- , there has been no real visible benefit from the increase in foreign presence .
nonetheless , most hungarians are looking forward to being part of the eu .
they see accession as an improvement in their lives .
bajko says he hopes that joining the eu will bring a higher level of standards across the board , both private and public .
" i hope that the standards will rise .
one can not be a member of the eu and neglect the public sector – not to the extent it ’ s happened here .
financially , the public sector is not so far along as the private industry .
but in a couple of years , i hope this will change . "
learning patience hungary will most likely enter the eu in 2004 , and may even be one of the first candidate countries to do so .
but not all of the desired improvements will take place right away .
the hungarians will have to learn to be patient , and to wait out the change .
wilhelm droste , a coffee house owner and poet in budapest , says the hungarians were always impatient , and wanted things to happen as quickly as possible .
" it ’ s probably the same situation in all of eastern europe , " he says pragmatically .
" somehow the people managed the leap to a capitalist society , and now everyone considers themselves an ‘ almost western european ’ .
but now we see how long people can hang in the air before they come down from that initial leap , and no one really knows where they will land .
and that ’ s the difficult part about it - the waiting and the uncertainty .

but some eu members say sanctions against third countries that do n't cooperate would be counter-productive . european union leaders found a letter from amnesty international in their mailboxes this week .
the international human rights organization wrote to say it was concerned that eu governments could try and outdo populist right-wing parties in their effort to stem illegal immigration into europe .
the human rights organization warned eu leaders not to legitimize the arguments of the far right .
the more than 1 million legal and illegal immigrants streaming the eu 's borders has taken on a new urgency in the european union with the rising popularity of anti-immigrant , right-wing parties in recent national elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's far-right national front party leader jean-marie le pen populist politicians have won large percentages of the votes in france , the netherlands and denmark , where they are now influencing the political agenda .
their focus on tightening immigration policies in their countries has added to the political momentum of the issue across europe and leaders plan to make it the top issue at an eu summit next week in seville , spain .
" if democratic politicians fail to tackle the difficult issues posed by immigration and asylum in the new global environment , people will increasingly embrace extremist solutions , " britain 's home secretary david blunkett said in a letter to his eu colleagues .
using economic clout as a threat but the newest eu proposal to stem immigration , which might involve cutting aid to third countries that do n't fight illegal immigration into eu countries , has run into heavy criticism . the proposal is part of a package eu interior ministers agreed upon on thursday in advance of the seville meeting on june 21-22 .
spain 's mariano rajoy , one of the architects of the draft paper , said countries of transit and origin for illegal immigrants need to do more to clamp down on document fraud and human trafficking , reinforce their border controls and launch campaigns against illegal immigration .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair britain 's prime minister tony blair -lrb- photo -rrb- had suggested that the eu should use its " economic and financial clout " to put pressure on countries that are unwilling to help the eu .
preventing a fortress europe but eu justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino is also opposed to the idea of sanctions .
france , sweden and several smaller eu states argue that such a move would be self-defeating .
cutting developmental aid for third world countries would not stem the flow of people wanting to leave , they argue .
rather than financial punishment , they would like to see some incentives in place for developing countries to take back migrants and improve their own border controls .
in a popular sentiment among the opponents , roman prodi , the president of the eu 's policy-shaping body , the european commission , warned against turning europe into a fortress closed to migrants . sweden 's migration and development aid minister jan karlsson warned interior ministers that " it should not be xenophobes who set the eu 's agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily but germany 's interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- does n't see that danger : " the eu does n't want to build a fortress europe , but remains open for legal migration , " he said .

but some eu members say sanctions against third countries that do n't cooperate would be counter-productive . european union leaders found a letter from amnesty international in their mailboxes this week .
the international human rights organization wrote to say it was concerned that eu governments could try and outdo populist right-wing parties in their effort to stem illegal immigration into europe .
the human rights organization warned eu leaders not to legitimize the arguments of the far right .
the more than 1 million legal and illegal immigrants streaming the eu 's borders has taken on a new urgency in the european union with the rising popularity of anti-immigrant , right-wing parties in recent national elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's far-right national front party leader jean-marie le pen populist politicians have won large percentages of the votes in france , the netherlands and denmark , where they are now influencing the political agenda .
their focus on tightening immigration policies in their countries has added to the political momentum of the issue across europe and leaders plan to make it the top issue at an eu summit next week in seville , spain .
" if democratic politicians fail to tackle the difficult issues posed by immigration and asylum in the new global environment , people will increasingly embrace extremist solutions , " britain 's home secretary david blunkett said in a letter to his eu colleagues .
using economic clout as a threat but the newest eu proposal to stem immigration , which might involve cutting aid to third countries that do n't fight illegal immigration into eu countries , has run into heavy criticism . the proposal is part of a package eu interior ministers agreed upon on thursday in advance of the seville meeting on june 21-22 .
spain 's mariano rajoy , one of the architects of the draft paper , said countries of transit and origin for illegal immigrants need to do more to clamp down on document fraud and human trafficking , reinforce their border controls and launch campaigns against illegal immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of would-be immigrants from north africa wait aboard a small boat after being intercepted by spanish police .
if they do n't , some eu leaders have proposed holding them responsible for the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair britain 's prime minister tony blair -lrb- photo -rrb- had suggested that the eu should use its " economic and financial clout " to put pressure on countries that are unwilling to help the eu .
preventing a fortress europe but eu justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino is also opposed to the idea of sanctions .
france , sweden and several smaller eu states argue that such a move would be self-defeating .
cutting developmental aid for third world countries would not stem the flow of people wanting to leave , they argue .
rather than financial punishment , they would like to see some incentives in place for developing countries to take back migrants and improve their own border controls .
in a popular sentiment among the opponents , roman prodi , the president of the eu 's policy-shaping body , the european commission , warned against turning europe into a fortress closed to migrants . sweden 's migration and development aid minister jan karlsson warned interior ministers that " it should not be xenophobes who set the eu 's agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily but germany 's interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- does n't see that danger : " the eu does n't want to build a fortress europe , but remains open for legal migration , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.06.2002 is the fdp channelling haider ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are jürgen möllemann and guido westerwelle surfing europe 's right-wing wave ?
in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .

in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .

in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guidomobil in order to gain younger voters , westerwelle created the mtv-style guidomobil motorhome that is traversing germany ; he brought in porno star dolly buster to campaign on the fdp 's behalf ; and he made an appearance on the popular " big brother " tv show last year .
though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .
they still could have mobilized potential voters from the right " without seriously damaging the fdp 's political credentials , he says .
now , it 's too late .
even if the opposition christian democrats and christian social union score big in the election , it is unlikely westerwelle will be given the traditional junior-coalition partner cabinet post of foreign minister . and after his political stumbling , there will be little room for möllemann in a coalition government .
" the cdu does n't want someone like möllemann in their cabinet , " says lösche , " you just ca n't predict what he 's going to do .

subway currently sells its trademark submarine sandwiches at 21 restaurants located in major german cities including berlin , frankfurt and munich .
the company opened its first german franchise in 1999 .
subway hopes to expand its number of restaurants in germany to 1,000 by 2010 .
" the market is ripe for our concept of fresh and healthy sandwiches , " said oliver friedrich , subway 's development manager in germany .
" our business falls right in the middle of the current wellness trend even as other fast-food products are declining in popularity , " he said .
subway 's bulging , made-to-order sandwiches - enormous by european standards - have climbed their way to the top of the fast-food heap in the united states , where the company has more restaurants than even mcdonald 's .
indeed , at the start of 2002 , subway had 13,247 restaurants in the u.s. versus mcdonald 's 13,099 , according to the company .
last year , it racked up $ 4.07 billion -lrb- € 4.02 billion -rrb- in sales worldwide .
the company faces considerable competition in germany - not just from already established fast food chains like mcdonald 's , kentucky fried chicken , pizza hut or burger king - but also from corner bakery chains like kamps or wiener feinbäcker , which sell most of the sandwiches in germany .
but the question remains whether subway 's culture of american-style sandwiches will catch on in a country where small cheese and meat-filled rolls sold by bakeries are often the closest you 'll find to a hoagie or blt . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conquering the world , one frappuccino at a time the first starbucks in berlin might as well have been the first starbucks in seattle or singapore for all it 's originality and local flair .
but it 's best not to tinker on the path to global domination .

the international human rights organization wrote to say it was concerned that eu governments could try and outdo populist right-wing parties in their effort to stem illegal immigration into europe .
the human rights organization warned eu leaders not to legitimize the arguments of the far right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe in transition romania — still a long way to go poland 's limp into the eu the czech republic - a bumpy ride into the eu lithuania 's search for security europe -pipe- 14.06.2002 hungary : a country of firsts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hungarian capital budapest in the round-up of eu candidate countries , hungary is a country of firsts .
compared to its eastern european neighbors , it has the best chances of entering the eu by the 2004 accession deadline . in 1989 hungary made a dramatic first step .
several months before the berlin wall fell , the hungarian government opened its borders to austria and the west , enabling thousands of east germans to flee across the iron curtain .
within less than a year germany was re-united , hungary had elected its first democratic government , and europe was on the way to erasing the east-west divide .
twelve years later , the iron curtain has all but disappeared .
in its place a new border has risen separating the european union member countries from their non-eu neighbors .
many of them are candidates for eu-membership . hungary is on the edge of that border .
by 2004 , however , it hopes to again make a dramatic move and become the first of the former eastern european countries to join the eu .
fast-paced tempo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rally in budapest , hungary so far the country is right on schedule , and if everything continues according to plan , hungary will be finished with all the necessary accession negotiations by the end of 2002 .
this is a fast-track plan , and one which suits the hungarian people just fine .
when asked how they feel about joining the eu , most hungarians say they can ’ t wait for it to take place .
it should have happened yesterday , many will say as they point to their country ’ s rapid economic development since the end of the cold war .
in just over twelve years , hungary has managed to completely turn around its staid socialist economy .
the government has pushed through a quick-paced liberalization of the market .
the energy , banking and telecommunication sectors have all been thoroughly privatized .
since 1997 , the economy has grown at a consistent rate of between four to five percent per year .
and unemployment has evened out to 5.6 percent , one of the lowest rates of all candidate countries .
with a little help from friends from audi and volkswagen to general electrics and siemens , nearly 30,000 foreign firms currently operate in hungary , churning out products for the country ’ s growing export markets .
since 1989 , the export volume has increased by more than 50 percent .
in 2001 , 65 percent of all trade was with the european union , 45 percent of which was with germany alone .
over the course of the last few years , international companies have poured in some 911 billion euro -lrb- $ 839 billion -rrb- in foreign investment and created thousands of jobs where there were none before .
this direct foreign investment is the highest per capita of all central and eastern european countries , and accounts for a good percentage of hungary ’ s overall economic growth .
economic success story anton kunszt , head of the german economic club in budapest , points to the high level of qualified labor and a good infrastructure as explanations for hungary ’ s economic success .
compared to other eastern european countries , hungary also has a stable government and a flexible economy .
kunszt says the economy and government are responsive to the needs of multi-national corporations , and that politicians understand how important foreign investment is for the nation ’ s economic success .
even if foreign companies buy up the majority of hungarian businesses and enjoy significant tax abatements -lrb- some are even tax free for over ten years -rrb- , most of the country sees it as a positive development .
where else would the money come from , the people ask themselves .
kunszt , who was born in hungary but left the country in the 1970s and returned again in the early 1990s , believes the country is on the right road to eu accession .
" i don ’ t think hungary is any less prepared now than spain or portugal were back when they entered the eu " , he says praising his homeland ’ s economic progress in the last few years .
private vs. public hungary ’ s economic success can be most clearly measured in the strong private sector growth .
here , the country is undoubtedly on the path to fast-track acceptance in the eu .
but when it comes to the public sector , hungary still has a ways to go .
all the economic growth and the investment has been solely in the private arena , says istvan bajko , a german teacher at the state business college in budapest .
public facilities and institutions are not much better off than they were at the end of 1989 .
" in the last ten years , the private sector has enjoyed strong development – especially thanks to the capital flowing in from western europe .
but the state sector – the health system , the education system , and so on – these all have a great deal of problems , " bajko comments while he stands in the middle of a run-down school room with an ancient chinese computer .
the national health care system , for instance , is so bankrupt , that hospital patients are asked to bring their own toilet paper and place settings -lrb- flat ware and dishes -rrb- for any meals they take while undergoing treatment .
where does all the money go ?
when it comes to wage earnings , only those fortunate enough to work for a big international company profit from hungary ’ s economic success .
state employees , such as teachers and doctors , earn far below what an assembly line worker at one of the foreign automobile manufacturers makes .
and many people are forced to take on two jobs just to make ends meet .
the standard of living and the cost of rent has risen parallel to the increase in foreign investment over the past few years .
it seems , the more foreign companies come to hungary , the better the goods in the store are , and the more expensive life becomes .
not everyone has profited from the country ’ s economic success .
in fact , since so many foreign corporations are excused from paying taxes , there is no real correlation between the number of international businesses and an increase in state income .
for those areas relying heavily on state support -lrb- health care , education , transportation , safety -rrb- , there has been no real visible benefit from the increase in foreign presence .
nonetheless , most hungarians are looking forward to being part of the eu .
they see accession as an improvement in their lives .
bajko says he hopes that joining the eu will bring a higher level of standards across the board , both private and public .
" i hope that the standards will rise .
one can not be a member of the eu and neglect the public sector – not to the extent it ’ s happened here .
financially , the public sector is not so far along as the private industry .
but in a couple of years , i hope this will change . "
learning patience hungary will most likely enter the eu in 2004 , and may even be one of the first candidate countries to do so .
but not all of the desired improvements will take place right away .
the hungarians will have to learn to be patient , and to wait out the change .
wilhelm droste , a coffee house owner and poet in budapest , says the hungarians were always impatient , and wanted things to happen as quickly as possible .
" it ’ s probably the same situation in all of eastern europe , " he says pragmatically .
" somehow the people managed the leap to a capitalist society , and now everyone considers themselves an ‘ almost western european ’ .
but now we see how long people can hang in the air before they come down from that initial leap , and no one really knows where they will land .
and that ’ s the difficult part about it - the waiting and the uncertainty .

the government has pushed through a quick-paced liberalization of the market .
the energy , banking and telecommunication sectors have all been thoroughly privatized .
since 1997 , the economy has grown at a consistent rate of between four to five percent per year .
and unemployment has evened out to 5.6 percent , one of the lowest rates of all candidate countries .
with a little help from friends from audi and volkswagen to general electrics and siemens , nearly 30,000 foreign firms currently operate in hungary , churning out products for the country ’ s growing export markets .
since 1989 , the export volume has increased by more than 50 percent .
in 2001 , 65 percent of all trade was with the european union , 45 percent of which was with germany alone .
over the course of the last few years , international companies have poured in some 911 billion euro -lrb- $ 839 billion -rrb- in foreign investment and created thousands of jobs where there were none before .
this direct foreign investment is the highest per capita of all central and eastern european countries , and accounts for a good percentage of hungary ’ s overall economic growth .
economic success story anton kunszt , head of the german economic club in budapest , points to the high level of qualified labor and a good infrastructure as explanations for hungary ’ s economic success .
compared to other eastern european countries , hungary also has a stable government and a flexible economy .
kunszt says the economy and government are responsive to the needs of multi-national corporations , and that politicians understand how important foreign investment is for the nation ’ s economic success .
even if foreign companies buy up the majority of hungarian businesses and enjoy significant tax abatements -lrb- some are even tax free for over ten years -rrb- , most of the country sees it as a positive development .
where else would the money come from , the people ask themselves .
kunszt , who was born in hungary but left the country in the 1970s and returned again in the early 1990s , believes the country is on the right road to eu accession .
" i don ’ t think hungary is any less prepared now than spain or portugal were back when they entered the eu " , he says praising his homeland ’ s economic progress in the last few years .
private vs. public hungary ’ s economic success can be most clearly measured in the strong private sector growth .
here , the country is undoubtedly on the path to fast-track acceptance in the eu .
but when it comes to the public sector , hungary still has a ways to go .
all the economic growth and the investment has been solely in the private arena , says istvan bajko , a german teacher at the state business college in budapest .
public facilities and institutions are not much better off than they were at the end of 1989 .
" in the last ten years , the private sector has enjoyed strong development – especially thanks to the capital flowing in from western europe .
but the state sector – the health system , the education system , and so on – these all have a great deal of problems , " bajko comments while he stands in the middle of a run-down school room with an ancient chinese computer .
the national health care system , for instance , is so bankrupt , that hospital patients are asked to bring their own toilet paper and place settings -lrb- flat ware and dishes -rrb- for any meals they take while undergoing treatment .
where does all the money go ?
when it comes to wage earnings , only those fortunate enough to work for a big international company profit from hungary ’ s economic success .
state employees , such as teachers and doctors , earn far below what an assembly line worker at one of the foreign automobile manufacturers makes .
and many people are forced to take on two jobs just to make ends meet .
the standard of living and the cost of rent has risen parallel to the increase in foreign investment over the past few years .
it seems , the more foreign companies come to hungary , the better the goods in the store are , and the more expensive life becomes .
not everyone has profited from the country ’ s economic success .
in fact , since so many foreign corporations are excused from paying taxes , there is no real correlation between the number of international businesses and an increase in state income .
for those areas relying heavily on state support -lrb- health care , education , transportation , safety -rrb- , there has been no real visible benefit from the increase in foreign presence .
nonetheless , most hungarians are looking forward to being part of the eu .
they see accession as an improvement in their lives .
bajko says he hopes that joining the eu will bring a higher level of standards across the board , both private and public .
" i hope that the standards will rise .
one can not be a member of the eu and neglect the public sector – not to the extent it ’ s happened here .
financially , the public sector is not so far along as the private industry .
but in a couple of years , i hope this will change . "
learning patience hungary will most likely enter the eu in 2004 , and may even be one of the first candidate countries to do so .
but not all of the desired improvements will take place right away .
the hungarians will have to learn to be patient , and to wait out the change .
wilhelm droste , a coffee house owner and poet in budapest , says the hungarians were always impatient , and wanted things to happen as quickly as possible .
" it ’ s probably the same situation in all of eastern europe , " he says pragmatically .
" somehow the people managed the leap to a capitalist society , and now everyone considers themselves an ‘ almost western european ’ .
but now we see how long people can hang in the air before they come down from that initial leap , and no one really knows where they will land .
and that ’ s the difficult part about it - the waiting and the uncertainty .

compared to its eastern european neighbors , it has the best chances of entering the eu by the 2004 accession deadline . in 1989 hungary made a dramatic first step .
several months before the berlin wall fell , the hungarian government opened its borders to austria and the west , enabling thousands of east germans to flee across the iron curtain .
within less than a year germany was re-united , hungary had elected its first democratic government , and europe was on the way to erasing the east-west divide .
twelve years later , the iron curtain has all but disappeared .
in its place a new border has risen separating the european union member countries from their non-eu neighbors .
many of them are candidates for eu-membership . hungary is on the edge of that border .
by 2004 , however , it hopes to again make a dramatic move and become the first of the former eastern european countries to join the eu .

compared to its eastern european neighbors , it has the best chances of entering the eu by the 2004 accession deadline . in 1989 hungary made a dramatic first step .
several months before the berlin wall fell , the hungarian government opened its borders to austria and the west , enabling thousands of east germans to flee across the iron curtain .
within less than a year germany was re-united , hungary had elected its first democratic government , and europe was on the way to erasing the east-west divide .
twelve years later , the iron curtain has all but disappeared .
in its place a new border has risen separating the european union member countries from their non-eu neighbors .
many of them are candidates for eu-membership . hungary is on the edge of that border .
by 2004 , however , it hopes to again make a dramatic move and become the first of the former eastern european countries to join the eu .
fast-paced tempo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rally in budapest , hungary so far the country is right on schedule , and if everything continues according to plan , hungary will be finished with all the necessary accession negotiations by the end of 2002 .
this is a fast-track plan , and one which suits the hungarian people just fine .
when asked how they feel about joining the eu , most hungarians say they can ’ t wait for it to take place .
it should have happened yesterday , many will say as they point to their country ’ s rapid economic development since the end of the cold war .
in just over twelve years , hungary has managed to completely turn around its staid socialist economy .
the government has pushed through a quick-paced liberalization of the market .
the energy , banking and telecommunication sectors have all been thoroughly privatized .
since 1997 , the economy has grown at a consistent rate of between four to five percent per year .
and unemployment has evened out to 5.6 percent , one of the lowest rates of all candidate countries .
with a little help from friends from audi and volkswagen to general electrics and siemens , nearly 30,000 foreign firms currently operate in hungary , churning out products for the country ’ s growing export markets .
since 1989 , the export volume has increased by more than 50 percent .
in 2001 , 65 percent of all trade was with the european union , 45 percent of which was with germany alone .
over the course of the last few years , international companies have poured in some 911 billion euro -lrb- $ 839 billion -rrb- in foreign investment and created thousands of jobs where there were none before .
this direct foreign investment is the highest per capita of all central and eastern european countries , and accounts for a good percentage of hungary ’ s overall economic growth .
economic success story anton kunszt , head of the german economic club in budapest , points to the high level of qualified labor and a good infrastructure as explanations for hungary ’ s economic success .
compared to other eastern european countries , hungary also has a stable government and a flexible economy .
kunszt says the economy and government are responsive to the needs of multi-national corporations , and that politicians understand how important foreign investment is for the nation ’ s economic success .
even if foreign companies buy up the majority of hungarian businesses and enjoy significant tax abatements -lrb- some are even tax free for over ten years -rrb- , most of the country sees it as a positive development .
where else would the money come from , the people ask themselves .
kunszt , who was born in hungary but left the country in the 1970s and returned again in the early 1990s , believes the country is on the right road to eu accession .
" i don ’ t think hungary is any less prepared now than spain or portugal were back when they entered the eu " , he says praising his homeland ’ s economic progress in the last few years .
private vs. public hungary ’ s economic success can be most clearly measured in the strong private sector growth .
here , the country is undoubtedly on the path to fast-track acceptance in the eu .
but when it comes to the public sector , hungary still has a ways to go .
all the economic growth and the investment has been solely in the private arena , says istvan bajko , a german teacher at the state business college in budapest .
public facilities and institutions are not much better off than they were at the end of 1989 .
" in the last ten years , the private sector has enjoyed strong development – especially thanks to the capital flowing in from western europe .
but the state sector – the health system , the education system , and so on – these all have a great deal of problems , " bajko comments while he stands in the middle of a run-down school room with an ancient chinese computer .
the national health care system , for instance , is so bankrupt , that hospital patients are asked to bring their own toilet paper and place settings -lrb- flat ware and dishes -rrb- for any meals they take while undergoing treatment .
where does all the money go ?
when it comes to wage earnings , only those fortunate enough to work for a big international company profit from hungary ’ s economic success .
state employees , such as teachers and doctors , earn far below what an assembly line worker at one of the foreign automobile manufacturers makes .
and many people are forced to take on two jobs just to make ends meet .
the standard of living and the cost of rent has risen parallel to the increase in foreign investment over the past few years .
it seems , the more foreign companies come to hungary , the better the goods in the store are , and the more expensive life becomes .
not everyone has profited from the country ’ s economic success .

in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guidomobil in order to gain younger voters , westerwelle created the mtv-style guidomobil motorhome that is traversing germany ; he brought in porno star dolly buster to campaign on the fdp 's behalf ; and he made an appearance on the popular " big brother " tv show last year .
though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .
they still could have mobilized potential voters from the right " without seriously damaging the fdp 's political credentials , he says .
now , it 's too late .
even if the opposition christian democrats and christian social union score big in the election , it is unlikely westerwelle will be given the traditional junior-coalition partner cabinet post of foreign minister . and after his political stumbling , there will be little room for möllemann in a coalition government .
" the cdu does n't want someone like möllemann in their cabinet , " says lösche , " you just ca n't predict what he 's going to do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.06.2002 is the fdp channelling haider ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are jürgen möllemann and guido westerwelle surfing europe 's right-wing wave ?
in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guidomobil in order to gain younger voters , westerwelle created the mtv-style guidomobil motorhome that is traversing germany ; he brought in porno star dolly buster to campaign on the fdp 's behalf ; and he made an appearance on the popular " big brother " tv show last year .
though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .
they still could have mobilized potential voters from the right " without seriously damaging the fdp 's political credentials , he says .
now , it 's too late .
even if the opposition christian democrats and christian social union score big in the election , it is unlikely westerwelle will be given the traditional junior-coalition partner cabinet post of foreign minister . and after his political stumbling , there will be little room for möllemann in a coalition government .
" the cdu does n't want someone like möllemann in their cabinet , " says lösche , " you just ca n't predict what he 's going to do .

could there be a champion among them ? this world cup , more than any other , has shown a lack of respect for history and myth .
first world and european champions france , then heavily-favored argentina fell to the likes of senegal and sweden and took early leave of the tournament .
from the moment the championships opened with a form-shattering 1-0 win for the africans over the french , the hierarchy of international football has been rocked by a series of mini revolutions that could quite possibly result in a major coup come july .
lacklustre french defence of trophy starts the upheaval les bleus eventually crashed out after capitulating to another set of rising stars in this world cup , denmark .
the 2-0 score line showed another shift in power ; france had not scored a single goal despite fielding the top scorers from the english , french and italian leagues as their strike force .

another team of strong scandinavians rocked argentina 's world when , five days later , sweden held them to a 1-1 draw , leaving only time for tears and packing before catching the flight home .
other big names have been scared witless by teams on the rise .
italy had to rely on an 85th minute equaliser from alessandro del piero against mexico to secure their passage to the next round .
african minnows exceed expectations so who will challenge the remainding big guns as the knockout stages kick off on saturday ?
it would be a good bet that senegal will continue to do their best to fulfil pele ’ s prophecy that an african winner is just around the corner .
after the african cup winners cameroon and former olympic champions nigeria self destructed , the erratic but explosive senegalese will be the continent 's sole competitors in the latter stages .

could there be a champion among them ? this world cup , more than any other , has shown a lack of respect for history and myth .
first world and european champions france , then heavily-favored argentina fell to the likes of senegal and sweden and took early leave of the tournament .
from the moment the championships opened with a form-shattering 1-0 win for the africans over the french , the hierarchy of international football has been rocked by a series of mini revolutions that could quite possibly result in a major coup come july .
lacklustre french defence of trophy starts the upheaval les bleus eventually crashed out after capitulating to another set of rising stars in this world cup , denmark .
the 2-0 score line showed another shift in power ; france had not scored a single goal despite fielding the top scorers from the english , french and italian leagues as their strike force .
meanwhile the danes scored more goals in one match against the out-going champions than the french managed in the whole tournament .
strong and well organised , the danish could well be outsiders with championship credentials .
argentina exposed as the bubble bursts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina supporters just before the make-up started to run ...
big noises were made of the challenge of argentina this time around .
with an expensive and talented squad , the south american millionaires followed up an unconvincing win against nigeria with a 1-0 defeat by england .
another team of strong scandinavians rocked argentina 's world when , five days later , sweden held them to a 1-1 draw , leaving only time for tears and packing before catching the flight home .
other big names have been scared witless by teams on the rise .
italy had to rely on an 85th minute equaliser from alessandro del piero against mexico to secure their passage to the next round .
african minnows exceed expectations so who will challenge the remainding big guns as the knockout stages kick off on saturday ?
it would be a good bet that senegal will continue to do their best to fulfil pele ’ s prophecy that an african winner is just around the corner .
after the african cup winners cameroon and former olympic champions nigeria self destructed , the erratic but explosive senegalese will be the continent 's sole competitors in the latter stages .

in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guidomobil in order to gain younger voters , westerwelle created the mtv-style guidomobil motorhome that is traversing germany ; he brought in porno star dolly buster to campaign on the fdp 's behalf ; and he made an appearance on the popular " big brother " tv show last year .
though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .
they still could have mobilized potential voters from the right " without seriously damaging the fdp 's political credentials , he says .
now , it 's too late .
even if the opposition christian democrats and christian social union score big in the election , it is unlikely westerwelle will be given the traditional junior-coalition partner cabinet post of foreign minister . and after his political stumbling , there will be little room for möllemann in a coalition government .
" the cdu does n't want someone like möllemann in their cabinet , " says lösche , " you just ca n't predict what he 's going to do .

during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .

though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .

in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .

could there be a champion among them ? this world cup , more than any other , has shown a lack of respect for history and myth .
first world and european champions france , then heavily-favored argentina fell to the likes of senegal and sweden and took early leave of the tournament .
from the moment the championships opened with a form-shattering 1-0 win for the africans over the french , the hierarchy of international football has been rocked by a series of mini revolutions that could quite possibly result in a major coup come july .
lacklustre french defence of trophy starts the upheaval les bleus eventually crashed out after capitulating to another set of rising stars in this world cup , denmark .
the 2-0 score line showed another shift in power ; france had not scored a single goal despite fielding the top scorers from the english , french and italian leagues as their strike force .
meanwhile the danes scored more goals in one match against the out-going champions than the french managed in the whole tournament .
strong and well organised , the danish could well be outsiders with championship credentials .
argentina exposed as the bubble bursts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina supporters just before the make-up started to run ...
big noises were made of the challenge of argentina this time around .
with an expensive and talented squad , the south american millionaires followed up an unconvincing win against nigeria with a 1-0 defeat by england .
another team of strong scandinavians rocked argentina 's world when , five days later , sweden held them to a 1-1 draw , leaving only time for tears and packing before catching the flight home .
other big names have been scared witless by teams on the rise .
italy had to rely on an 85th minute equaliser from alessandro del piero against mexico to secure their passage to the next round .
african minnows exceed expectations so who will challenge the remainding big guns as the knockout stages kick off on saturday ?
it would be a good bet that senegal will continue to do their best to fulfil pele ’ s prophecy that an african winner is just around the corner .
after the african cup winners cameroon and former olympic champions nigeria self destructed , the erratic but explosive senegalese will be the continent 's sole competitors in the latter stages .
their combination of flair and unpredicatability will no doubt cause the rigid swedes problems when they meet on sunday .
and who would rule out an asian champion ?

also playing in group h are belgium and tunisia .
after dispensing with russia and tunisia , japan have gone from strength to strength on the back of phenomenal local support and the driving force of inamoto and nakata . turkey will find themselves up against unexpectedly worthy opposition when they take on the co-hosts in miyagi .
a great result against the battling turks will see japan in the quarter finals for the first time .
meanwhile south korea have proved a surprise package capable of making fools of anyone .
it will be a brave coach who underestimates guus hiddink 's youngsters .
portugal 's antonio oliveira 's medal of valour will be of little comfort after his flamboyant side were knocked out by the koreans .
another one bites the dust ...
one thing has emerged as a certainty from this uncertain championship .
the belief in a ‘ big six ’ and the indulgence of seeding positions hold no sway with the emerging nations who have watched and learned while the dominant teams of old have congratulated each other .
it now truly is a world cup . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de senegal upsets france in inaugural match the opening match of the 2002 world cup sees senegal beat reigning champions france 1-0 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.06.2002 is the fdp channelling haider ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are jürgen möllemann and guido westerwelle surfing europe 's right-wing wave ?
in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guidomobil in order to gain younger voters , westerwelle created the mtv-style guidomobil motorhome that is traversing germany ; he brought in porno star dolly buster to campaign on the fdp 's behalf ; and he made an appearance on the popular " big brother " tv show last year .
though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .
they still could have mobilized potential voters from the right " without seriously damaging the fdp 's political credentials , he says .
now , it 's too late .
even if the opposition christian democrats and christian social union score big in the election , it is unlikely westerwelle will be given the traditional junior-coalition partner cabinet post of foreign minister . and after his political stumbling , there will be little room for möllemann in a coalition government .
" the cdu does n't want someone like möllemann in their cabinet , " says lösche , " you just ca n't predict what he 's going to do .

subway currently sells its trademark submarine sandwiches at 21 restaurants located in major german cities including berlin , frankfurt and munich .
the company opened its first german franchise in 1999 .
subway hopes to expand its number of restaurants in germany to 1,000 by 2010 .
" the market is ripe for our concept of fresh and healthy sandwiches , " said oliver friedrich , subway 's development manager in germany .
" our business falls right in the middle of the current wellness trend even as other fast-food products are declining in popularity , " he said .
subway 's bulging , made-to-order sandwiches - enormous by european standards - have climbed their way to the top of the fast-food heap in the united states , where the company has more restaurants than even mcdonald 's .
indeed , at the start of 2002 , subway had 13,247 restaurants in the u.s. versus mcdonald 's 13,099 , according to the company .
last year , it racked up $ 4.07 billion -lrb- € 4.02 billion -rrb- in sales worldwide .
the company faces considerable competition in germany - not just from already established fast food chains like mcdonald 's , kentucky fried chicken , pizza hut or burger king - but also from corner bakery chains like kamps or wiener feinbäcker , which sell most of the sandwiches in germany .
but the question remains whether subway 's culture of american-style sandwiches will catch on in a country where small cheese and meat-filled rolls sold by bakeries are often the closest you 'll find to a hoagie or blt . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conquering the world , one frappuccino at a time the first starbucks in berlin might as well have been the first starbucks in seattle or singapore for all it 's originality and local flair .
but it 's best not to tinker on the path to global domination .

could there be a champion among them ? this world cup , more than any other , has shown a lack of respect for history and myth .
first world and european champions france , then heavily-favored argentina fell to the likes of senegal and sweden and took early leave of the tournament .
from the moment the championships opened with a form-shattering 1-0 win for the africans over the french , the hierarchy of international football has been rocked by a series of mini revolutions that could quite possibly result in a major coup come july .
lacklustre french defence of trophy starts the upheaval les bleus eventually crashed out after capitulating to another set of rising stars in this world cup , denmark .
the 2-0 score line showed another shift in power ; france had not scored a single goal despite fielding the top scorers from the english , french and italian leagues as their strike force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.06.2002 is the fdp channelling haider ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are jürgen möllemann and guido westerwelle surfing europe 's right-wing wave ?
in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guidomobil in order to gain younger voters , westerwelle created the mtv-style guidomobil motorhome that is traversing germany ; he brought in porno star dolly buster to campaign on the fdp 's behalf ; and he made an appearance on the popular " big brother " tv show last year .
though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .
they still could have mobilized potential voters from the right " without seriously damaging the fdp 's political credentials , he says .
now , it 's too late .
even if the opposition christian democrats and christian social union score big in the election , it is unlikely westerwelle will be given the traditional junior-coalition partner cabinet post of foreign minister . and after his political stumbling , there will be little room for möllemann in a coalition government .
" the cdu does n't want someone like möllemann in their cabinet , " says lösche , " you just ca n't predict what he 's going to do .

in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guidomobil in order to gain younger voters , westerwelle created the mtv-style guidomobil motorhome that is traversing germany ; he brought in porno star dolly buster to campaign on the fdp 's behalf ; and he made an appearance on the popular " big brother " tv show last year .
though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .
they still could have mobilized potential voters from the right " without seriously damaging the fdp 's political credentials , he says .
now , it 's too late .
even if the opposition christian democrats and christian social union score big in the election , it is unlikely westerwelle will be given the traditional junior-coalition partner cabinet post of foreign minister . and after his political stumbling , there will be little room for möllemann in a coalition government .
" the cdu does n't want someone like möllemann in their cabinet , " says lösche , " you just ca n't predict what he 's going to do .

could there be a champion among them ? this world cup , more than any other , has shown a lack of respect for history and myth .
first world and european champions france , then heavily-favored argentina fell to the likes of senegal and sweden and took early leave of the tournament .
from the moment the championships opened with a form-shattering 1-0 win for the africans over the french , the hierarchy of international football has been rocked by a series of mini revolutions that could quite possibly result in a major coup come july .
lacklustre french defence of trophy starts the upheaval les bleus eventually crashed out after capitulating to another set of rising stars in this world cup , denmark .
the 2-0 score line showed another shift in power ; france had not scored a single goal despite fielding the top scorers from the english , french and italian leagues as their strike force .
meanwhile the danes scored more goals in one match against the out-going champions than the french managed in the whole tournament .
strong and well organised , the danish could well be outsiders with championship credentials .
argentina exposed as the bubble bursts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina supporters just before the make-up started to run ...
big noises were made of the challenge of argentina this time around .
with an expensive and talented squad , the south american millionaires followed up an unconvincing win against nigeria with a 1-0 defeat by england .
another team of strong scandinavians rocked argentina 's world when , five days later , sweden held them to a 1-1 draw , leaving only time for tears and packing before catching the flight home .
other big names have been scared witless by teams on the rise .
italy had to rely on an 85th minute equaliser from alessandro del piero against mexico to secure their passage to the next round .
african minnows exceed expectations so who will challenge the remainding big guns as the knockout stages kick off on saturday ?
it would be a good bet that senegal will continue to do their best to fulfil pele ’ s prophecy that an african winner is just around the corner .
after the african cup winners cameroon and former olympic champions nigeria self destructed , the erratic but explosive senegalese will be the continent 's sole competitors in the latter stages .
their combination of flair and unpredicatability will no doubt cause the rigid swedes problems when they meet on sunday .
and who would rule out an asian champion ?

also playing in group h are belgium and tunisia .
after dispensing with russia and tunisia , japan have gone from strength to strength on the back of phenomenal local support and the driving force of inamoto and nakata . turkey will find themselves up against unexpectedly worthy opposition when they take on the co-hosts in miyagi .
a great result against the battling turks will see japan in the quarter finals for the first time .
meanwhile south korea have proved a surprise package capable of making fools of anyone .
it will be a brave coach who underestimates guus hiddink 's youngsters .
portugal 's antonio oliveira 's medal of valour will be of little comfort after his flamboyant side were knocked out by the koreans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.06.2002 is the fdp channelling haider ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are jürgen möllemann and guido westerwelle surfing europe 's right-wing wave ?
in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .

part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guidomobil in order to gain younger voters , westerwelle created the mtv-style guidomobil motorhome that is traversing germany ; he brought in porno star dolly buster to campaign on the fdp 's behalf ; and he made an appearance on the popular " big brother " tv show last year .
though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .
they still could have mobilized potential voters from the right " without seriously damaging the fdp 's political credentials , he says .
now , it 's too late .
even if the opposition christian democrats and christian social union score big in the election , it is unlikely westerwelle will be given the traditional junior-coalition partner cabinet post of foreign minister . and after his political stumbling , there will be little room for möllemann in a coalition government .

in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .

in an effort to draw 18 percent of voters , the free democrats began flirting with right-wing populists .
but that does n't make it the haider party of germany , a leading political scientist tells dw-world . the recent political locking of horns between the free democrats ' second-in-command , jürgen möllemann , and germany 's largest jewish organization damaged the fdp and led many to allege that its leaders are doing free trade in anti-semitism .
adding to the harm , the fdp has been accused of transforming itself into a magnet for right-wing populist voters in a cynical ploy to become a coalition partner in the next german government . some have even started to depict fdp chairman guido westerwelle 's deputy , möllemann , as a german incarnation of austria 's jörg haider , france 's jean-marie le pen , or holland 's recently slain pim fortuyn .
in other words , they view möllemann , who is the party 's chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia , as a political opportunist pushing his party to the right in order to take advantage of the current populist wave in europe .
it helped matters none that haider recently sang möllemann 's praises , saying he would " suit us quite well " in efforts to build a europe-wide right-wing bloc by 2004 .
-lrb- previously , möllemann had congratulated haider for originally launching the new rightward trend . -rrb-
even if möllemann did reject haider 's gesture , the fact that the austrian had taken notice shows the extent to which the german politician 's recent actions have skewed international perceptions of the liberal free democrats .
möllemann 's recent accusation that michael friedman , the deputy chairman of the central council of jews in germany fueled anti-semitism with his " intolerant , hateful style , " prompted german political leaders and the jewish community to accuse him of the worst form of discrimination in the book : blaming the victim .
critics said his initial refusal to apologize only served to empower anti-semites .
but his polemic was also out of character with the fdp 's history of promoting social tolerance - a fact that is often forgotten these heated days leading up to the september 22 elections .
the free democrats have long been known for their free-market policies and social liberalism .
in recent years , in addition to calling for tax cuts , the fdp has supported same-sex marriages and promoted immigration - two areas that do n't generally fit the agenda of a party trying to foment right-wing populist sentiment .
in their efforts to increase the party 's power , however , westerwelle and möllemann have been playing with fire .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 18 percent !
part of the problem lies in the party 's " 18 percent " campaign slogan - so named for the percentage of voters it would take for the fdp to assure itself a slot as the junior partner in germany 's next coalition government .
during parliamentary elections in 1994 and 1998 , the party never gathered more than 6.9 percent of the overall vote , and few believe that the party is capable of gathering 18 percent of the vote without pulling disaffected voters both from the far-left and the far-right under its wings .
flirting with youths and extremists peter lösche , a professor of political science at the university of göttingen , is the author of the book : " the fdp : the fight over its direction and doubts for the future . "
in his view , the fdp 's strategy to gain 18 percent is based on maintaining its traditional base of free market-supporting , bourgeois professionals , gaining youth voters and trying to draw neo-populists - including dissatisfied members of the far-left party of democratic socialism , the successor to east germany 's communists , and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guidomobil in order to gain younger voters , westerwelle created the mtv-style guidomobil motorhome that is traversing germany ; he brought in porno star dolly buster to campaign on the fdp 's behalf ; and he made an appearance on the popular " big brother " tv show last year .
though westerwelle 's gestures to the " fun and event crowd " annoyed some core fdp voters , it was the neo-populist factor that blew up in his face .
" they failed to recognize that what they were going to gain on the right , they would lose in the center sections which have a high regard for human rights , " lösche told dw-world .
" the party 's traditional voters get irritated when the fdp shifts to the right or tries to attract voters from that segment , " he said .
" you need a haider to haiderize " but despite its flirtation with right-wing politics , lösche does not see this as the haider-ization of the free democrats .
to do that , he says , " you need a haider . "
despite willingness to gamble with the most-taboo subjects in post-wwii europe , möllemann is no haider .
nor is westerwelle .
besides , haider-ization would require a complete retooling of the free democrats ' political philosophy .
lösche cites the liberals ' tradition of laissez-faire economic policies and tolerance toward human rights and immigration as ideas that make it incompatible with neo-populist thinking .
neo-populism , lösche says , " instrumentalizes latent prejudices within society against foreigners , jews or whomever .
there have been examples of other european neo-liberal parties turning into neo-populists parties , but i see no danger of that happening with the fdp . "
nonetheless , in lösche 's assessment , the fdp 's campaign strategy failed .
" it looked rational at first , but they should have withdrawn within a few days -lrb- of the jamal karsli incident -rrb- .
they still could have mobilized potential voters from the right " without seriously damaging the fdp 's political credentials , he says .
now , it 's too late .
even if the opposition christian democrats and christian social union score big in the election , it is unlikely westerwelle will be given the traditional junior-coalition partner cabinet post of foreign minister . and after his political stumbling , there will be little room for möllemann in a coalition government .
" the cdu does n't want someone like möllemann in their cabinet , " says lösche , " you just ca n't predict what he 's going to do .

" if democratic politicians fail to tackle the difficult issues posed by immigration and asylum in the new global environment , people will increasingly embrace extremist solutions , " britain 's home secretary david blunkett said in a letter to his eu colleagues .
using economic clout as a threat but the newest eu proposal to stem immigration , which might involve cutting aid to third countries that do n't fight illegal immigration into eu countries , has run into heavy criticism . the proposal is part of a package eu interior ministers agreed upon on thursday in advance of the seville meeting on june 21-22 .
spain 's mariano rajoy , one of the architects of the draft paper , said countries of transit and origin for illegal immigrants need to do more to clamp down on document fraud and human trafficking , reinforce their border controls and launch campaigns against illegal immigration .

cutting developmental aid for third world countries would not stem the flow of people wanting to leave , they argue .
rather than financial punishment , they would like to see some incentives in place for developing countries to take back migrants and improve their own border controls .
in a popular sentiment among the opponents , roman prodi , the president of the eu 's policy-shaping body , the european commission , warned against turning europe into a fortress closed to migrants . sweden 's migration and development aid minister jan karlsson warned interior ministers that " it should not be xenophobes who set the eu 's agenda .

but some eu members say sanctions against third countries that do n't cooperate would be counter-productive . european union leaders found a letter from amnesty international in their mailboxes this week .
the international human rights organization wrote to say it was concerned that eu governments could try and outdo populist right-wing parties in their effort to stem illegal immigration into europe .
the human rights organization warned eu leaders not to legitimize the arguments of the far right .
the more than 1 million legal and illegal immigrants streaming the eu 's borders has taken on a new urgency in the european union with the rising popularity of anti-immigrant , right-wing parties in recent national elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's far-right national front party leader jean-marie le pen populist politicians have won large percentages of the votes in france , the netherlands and denmark , where they are now influencing the political agenda .
their focus on tightening immigration policies in their countries has added to the political momentum of the issue across europe and leaders plan to make it the top issue at an eu summit next week in seville , spain .
" if democratic politicians fail to tackle the difficult issues posed by immigration and asylum in the new global environment , people will increasingly embrace extremist solutions , " britain 's home secretary david blunkett said in a letter to his eu colleagues .
using economic clout as a threat but the newest eu proposal to stem immigration , which might involve cutting aid to third countries that do n't fight illegal immigration into eu countries , has run into heavy criticism . the proposal is part of a package eu interior ministers agreed upon on thursday in advance of the seville meeting on june 21-22 .
spain 's mariano rajoy , one of the architects of the draft paper , said countries of transit and origin for illegal immigrants need to do more to clamp down on document fraud and human trafficking , reinforce their border controls and launch campaigns against illegal immigration .

preventing a fortress europe but eu justice and home affairs commissioner antonio vitorino is also opposed to the idea of sanctions .
france , sweden and several smaller eu states argue that such a move would be self-defeating .
cutting developmental aid for third world countries would not stem the flow of people wanting to leave , they argue .
rather than financial punishment , they would like to see some incentives in place for developing countries to take back migrants and improve their own border controls .
in a popular sentiment among the opponents , roman prodi , the president of the eu 's policy-shaping body , the european commission , warned against turning europe into a fortress closed to migrants . sweden 's migration and development aid minister jan karlsson warned interior ministers that " it should not be xenophobes who set the eu 's agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily but germany 's interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- does n't see that danger : " the eu does n't want to build a fortress europe , but remains open for legal migration , " he said .

subway currently sells its trademark submarine sandwiches at 21 restaurants located in major german cities including berlin , frankfurt and munich .
the company opened its first german franchise in 1999 .
subway hopes to expand its number of restaurants in germany to 1,000 by 2010 .

but it is not yet clear where the money will come from to pay for them .
the change of tack is the result of pressure from senior figures within the ruling liberal democratic party .
they have demanded that cuts kick in as early as january , rather than waiting for the beginning of the financial year in april .
wher 's the money ?
tax cuts are a thorny issue for prime minister junichiro koizumi , who has been wrestling with slumping popularity all year .
most parts of the government are agreed on the need to reform the tax system , in the hope of boosting demand and corporate investment .
but the problem is finding the money .
mr koizumi has vowed not to issue more than 30 trillion yen -lrb- $ 242bn ; £ 164bn -rrb- in government bonds this year , to minimise growth in japan 's already swollen public debt .
accelerating the tax cuts could put that at risk - although finance minister masajuro shiokawa promised the cap would remain intact and no supplementary budget was planned .
factions in the meantime , though , the talks between ministers and senior figures in the traditionally faction-ridden ldp have forced the government 's hand .
the situation exemplifies mr koizumi 's current problems .
despite healthy growth of 1.4 % in the first three months of this year , japan 's economy is far from secure on the path to recovery from a decade of downturn , and observers are united in the view that radical reform is needed .
last year , in the early months of his premiership , mr koizumi 's popularity as a " non-standard " politician helped him ride out protests against policy shifts from his party 's pork-barrel-fuelled faction bosses .
but a squalid piece of party infighting which saw the popular foreign minister makiko tanaka dismissed has halved his approval ratings , and mr koizumi 's administration seems more and more to be returning to business as usual .

the accounts commission endorsed a report clearing fife council of any wrongdoing in its dealings with the organisation at the heart of the officegate affair .
but it said the matter held important lessons for all local authorities .
it has urged scottish councils to examine and review their arrangements with bodies such as the third age group , a luncheon club for the elderly in fife which received funding from the council .
henry mcleish resigned over the affair the charity rented office space from mr mcleish , whose failure to declare the sub-let forced his resignation and triggered several inquiries .
the central fife msp stepped down as first minister last november over the officegate row , which centred on six sub-lets of his constituency office in glenrothes .
he failed to declare income from the tenants while also claiming full westminster expenses as an mp for the area .
however , it also emerged that fife council had given the charity funding after it had been wound up .
' wholly irregular ' in may , a report by audit scotland found that the council had given the charity grants of £ 98,000 , a quarter of which was handed over after its management committee was wound up .
it expressed serious concern about this move , describing it as wholly irregular , but said that there was sufficient evidence to conclude that money was used for the purpose intended .
however , the report identified procedural shortcomings in the council 's financial and other involvements with the third age group .
the accounts commission , scotland 's local authority spending watchdog , has endorsed that report .
the commission said fife council had agreed a wide-ranging package of measures to be carried out following the audit scotland report .
scottish councils are encouraged to identify and review their arrangements with arms-length bodies accounts commission report and it declared : " the commission endorses the need for a national review of councils ' involvement with arms-length organisations and looks forward to the outcome of that exercise .
" in the meantime , scottish councils are encouraged to identify and review their arrangements with arms-length bodies . "
bruce merchant , deputy chairman of the commission , said that although the problems had been highlighted at fife council , the affair held important lessons for all local authorities .
" all councils need to have proper governance arrangements in place , in particular audit committees or their equivalent , " he said .
" equally important is the need for proper arrangements when dealing with arms-length bodies like the third age group .
" in these circumstances councils need to be clear about why funds are being given to these bodies , how the money will be used and accounted for and ensure that proper monitoring arrangements are in place .

workers voted on friday in favour of a compromise with management at bhp steel 's western port factory in melbourne .
the plant supplies car factories , building contractors and other businesses .
the deal to settle the strike - called because the company was planning to shift some workers to part-time hours and contract out some maintenance - means that maintenance workers ' job security is guaranteed .
it follows a riot police operation on horseback earlier this week , which forced back pickets sufficiently to get 400 tonnes of steel out of the plant .
just in time but even though the plant is coming back onstream , the bosses of australia 's car industry were keen to point out that their business risks losing its way altogether if industrial action continues .
three strikes in less than a year have interrupted the just-in-time supply chains on which modern car plants rely .
the president of ford australia , geoff polites , said on friday that any more stoppages could trigger a shift to overseas suppliers .
" we could go overseas right now - permanently , " he told the australian newspaper .
" i 'm not saying we 're going do , but the chances are we do n't need to buy this steel in australia any more .
and if we move to buy it overseas it will never , ever come back . "
noting ford 's close relationship with nippon steel , mr polites said the marginal cost of importing from japan was " a hell of a lot less than losing a couple of days of production " .
but not everyone is willing to make such threats .

he stood aside almost a year ago when south wales police launched an investigation into his past business dealings , but was given the job back when it was announced on thursday that there would be no charges .
first minister rhodri morgan announced mr german was being instantly reinstated as his no.2.
the inquiry related to mr german 's job at the wjec and he promised that the am would be given " a major role " in the cabinet once he had worked out his reshuffle .
the crown prosecution service decided there was insufficient evidence to press criminal charges against mr german in connection with his former role at the welsh exam board -lrb- wjec -rrb- .
allegations were made against mr german concerning corporate expenses claims while he was head of the wjec 's european unit .
but opposition ams urged mr morgan not to reinstate mr german until a separate investigation by olaf , the european fraud unit , had been concluded .
the 57-year-old has now been linked to a prominent cabinet portfolio .
mr german had always denied any charge of wrong-doing and he accused labour figures of a politically-motivated witch hunt .
the cps advised there is insufficient evidence of any criminal charges det supt graham davies he said he was now considering legal action , having accused the bbc of " libelling " him , but the corporation said its actions had been shown to be scrupulous and fair .
" i am absolutely delighted once and for all that this is behind me , " mr german said .
" the past year has been the most difficult of my life . "
and , he said , referring to the first minister 's backing : " he -lrb- rhodri -rrb- made a public statement that i would return and i know him to be a man of his word . "
minutes after the queen left cardiff bay after addressing assembly members as part of her jubilee tour of wales , mr morgan told of his colleague 's reinstatement .
mr german always denied any wrong-doing he said : " as part of the agreement between the labour party and the liberal democrats , the first minister has agreed to appoint the liberal democrat assembly leader to the cabinet as deputy first minister .
" this will now take place with immediate effect and mr german now resumes his membership of the cabinet as deputy first minister .
it was last july that mr german announced that he was to step aside temporarily as the deputy first minister because of the police inquiry .
detective superintendent graham davies , of south wales police , said on thursday : " the crown prosecution service has considered the file of evidence .
they advised there is insufficient evidence of any criminal charges . "
' cooked up ' mr german - who had the backing of liberal democrat leader charles kennedy - claimed at the start of the investigation that it had been " cooked up " by labour " local government barons " .
their motive , he said , was opposition to the liberal democrat coalition with labour at the welsh assembly .
replaced by mr morgan himself in the economic development portfolio , mr german 's former post was later handed over to former business minister andrew davies .

simon grey alleges he was abused over an eight-year period by father christopher clonan , then assistant parish priest at a coventry church .
mr grey , now 36 and living in leicester , says he was psychologically damaged by his experiences and turned to crime and alcoholism .
he has launched the action against the archbishop of birmingham and the trustees of the birmingham archdiocese of the roman catholic church .
police search mr grey claims father clonan 's superior was made aware of the priest 's alleged abuse of another boy in 1974 , but failed to act .
the two-day hearing will decide whether the case has been launched within the statutory time limit , which will determine whether or not it can proceed .
robert seabrook qc told deputy judge john leighton williams qc the case could not be brought against father clonan as he had fled when complaints were made about him in 1992 .
" there have been a number of attempts to find him by the church and the police but he has disappeared off the scene . "
mr grey claims he was first abused at the age of 10 in 1975 when he became an altar boy at christ the king church in coundon , coventry .
mr seabrook told the court mr grey had been abused on a weekly basis , and was one of a number of victims .
" that abuse culminated or included the most serious end of the spectrum . "
late claim he said mr grey had become an alcoholic and had taken to injuring himself , once almost cutting off an arm and another time setting himself alight .
he had since cut back on drinking , turned his back on crime , and got married .

ba has chosen the us firm 's connexion .
it reportedly picked connexion in preference to another system made by european firm airbus .
ba said it had chosen connexion because it was a broadband system .
" connexion by boeing allows passengers to not only surf the internet while on board but also allows business travellers to access their corporate and personal e-mail accounts , send real-time e-mails and access their corporate networks , " said martin george , ba 's director of marketing .

" the technology could also provide british airways with the capability to broadcast live tv and radio shows - all in flight " , said ba .
ba said 75 % of its business travellers take laptops on board with them and its research has shown that most of them were " extremely or very interested " in having internet access during the flight .
ba said it would begin trials of the system in february 2003 .
passengers who want to use the service are likely to have to pay bout £ 20 -lrb- $ 29.4 -rrb- on each flight .
initially , ba will test the system for three months in one boeing 747-400 aircraft , but if the trial is successful , the system could be installed on all the airline 's 100 longhaul planes by the end of next year , the independent newspaper reported .
german airline lufthansa has also picked the connexion system .
as to how to fund the installation , one option reportedly under discussion is for boeing to take on part of the costs in return for a share of revenues .
ba gave no details of installation costs or the value of the deal .
