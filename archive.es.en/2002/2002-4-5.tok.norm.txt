nigel de gruchy of the nasuwt said most of them were " ambitious , self-seeking , self-opinionated rogues " .
in an emotional speech to his union 's conference on his retirement as its general secretary , mr de gruchy accused the prime minister , tony blair , of running a dictatorial system dependent upon the " fawning ambitions " of underlings jostling to succeed him .
he broadened his attack to take in " all political parties , in power and in opposition " , ridiculing the conservative leader , iain duncan smith 's claim to be " the champion of the sick and underprivileged " .
" really , what fools do they take the nation to be ? " he said .
citizenship " politicians create the problem , then they blame schools , then they demand that teachers solve the problem , " he said .
" then they wonder why cynicism is rife . "
he called on mr blair " to restore democracy " to his party , parliament and the cabinet .
" then perhaps citizenship might just be worthwhile teaching in schools . "
he did make an exception - " maybe " - in the case of the current education secretary , estelle morris , but said successive education ministers all felt they had to make their mark .
and he asked her : " is your memory so short ? "
industrial action in the past she had boasted about once having been a teacher .
in the 1980s she had taken part in pay strikes .
would she still be saying the sorts of things she had been saying about teachers in recent weeks if she were still a teacher ?
mr de gruchy made his speech shortly after the union had voted to call a strike if there was not a satisfactory outcome to the dispute with the government about the under-funding of their performance pay .
he said it was all very well for ms morris to condemn industrial action , but her predecessor , david blunkett , had initially refused to commission an independent study into teachers ' workloads .
" after about 10 days of industrial action he agreed to it . "
and he said " good , solid industrial action by teachers " had led to the dearing reports that resulted in the slimming down of the national curriculum from 1993 .
the government rejected mr de gruchy 's attacks .
a spokesman for the department for education and skills said : " i think we are all used to intemperate remarks at the easter conferences .
" the government 's record on education speaks for itself , with £ 540 extra per pupil and 12,000 more teachers than in 1997 .
" the key point is that these conferences , with their repeated threats of industrial action , do damage to the image and reputation of teachers . "
ovation mr de gruchy said he had made a point throughout his 12 years as the union 's general secretary of trying to remember what it was like to be a classroom teacher .
with his wife , judy , at his side and son , paul , in the audience , he was given a standing ovation .
at the age of 59 he leaves the nasuwt , hoping to become the next president of the trades union congress .
he is succeeded by eamonn o 'kane .
soundbites in a tribute to him , mr o 'kane said he had done a tremendous amount to raise the morale of the teaching profession .
and his " clear , cogent thinking " manifested itself in his mastery of the pithy soundbite .
jim hughes from bexley recalled some of his one-liners : on a work-to-rule over rising bureaucracy : " it is industrial action with a halo . "
on parental responsibilities : " a school homework club is a contradiction . "
on a government recruitment slogan : " no-one forgets a good teacher , they just forget to pay them well . "
