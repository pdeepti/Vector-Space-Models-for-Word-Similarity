the deal , which hynix 's board approved on thursday , was put forward by the firm 's creditors .
the creditors holding hynix 's estimated 9 trillion won -lrb- $ 7bn ; £ 4.8bn -rrb- debt will swap it for a controlling shareholding in what is at present the number three memory chip firm worldwide .
they should then be able to divide up the company and sell off the parts as and when buyers come to light .
dealing with dram there remains uncertainty , though , about what will happen to the memory chip business .
although the production of dynamic ram chips , as they are known , is the jewel in hynix 's crown , it has also been its downfall , as massive oversupply over the past couple of years led to falling prices .
for months the company was negotiating with us chipmaker micron technologies with a view to selling it the operation for $ 3.4bn.
but on 30 april hynix 's board threw out the plan , which creditors had already endorsed .
hynix itself wants to hang onto the dram operation , selling off the rest and relying on a recovery in dram prices to turn the company around .
stumbling blocks but analysts point out that hynix could face a number of problems with this plan .
firstly , the creditors are likely to get rid of the existing board and put their own people in place .
that should speed up the sell off process , and a new board is unlikely to be as attached to the dram business as the current one .
secondly , the revival in dram prices has stalled in the wake of hynix 's rejection of the micron deal , with prices slipping up to 20 % .

the ranks of australia 's jobless swelled unexpectedly in april , just a day after the country 's central bank began tightening interest rates to keep a lid on the consumer boom .
the seasonally adjusted figures showed that a net 43,500 jobs disappeared last month , contrary to expectations of a slight rise in employment .
but a fall in the number of people looking for work meant the headline rate stayed steady at 6.3 % , lower than at any time since january 2001 .
such a level , said national australia bank head of market economics tony pearson , " is still a very good result " indicating a rapidly improving labour market .
" that is the result of the very strong growth we have had in the economy , " he said .
" it certainly does indicate that it was time for the reserve bank to ease the foot off the accelerator . "
more to come the bank did precisely that on wednesday , edging interest rates up for the first time in 19 months by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.5 % .
the downturn last year saw the bank slice two points off the base rate , helping growth to reach 4.1 % in the fourth quarter of 2001 and forestalling much of the global slowdown .
now the trend is back up , as the bank tries to avoid the inflationary effects of the consumer spending boom - and tries to cap a soaring housing market as well .
pay up the employment numbers , indicating that 11,600 part-time jobs were created while 55,100 full-time ones evaporated , came as low-paid workers got their biggest pay boost in 20 years .
the australian industrial relations commission has added 18 australian dollars -lrb- us $ 9.74 ; £ 6.68 -rrb- to the federal minimum wage , taking it to a $ 431.40 -lrb- $ 233.46 ; £ 160.21 -rrb- a week from a $ 413.40 .
unions had argued for an even bigger increase than the 4.4 % awarded , but employers said the decision would cost a $ 1.6bn and about 37,000 jobs .
the airc , though said the move was necessary to " provide to the needs of the low-paid and maintain the real value of wages " .
wages are failing to keep pace with price rises , according to the latest government figures .
its ruling covers low-paid workers including hotel employees , childminders and security guards , who often earn less than a $ 13 an hour .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- japanese figures hint at revival categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 9 may , 2002 , 06:38 gmt 07:38 uk japanese figures hint at revival could things be on the up for beleaguered japan ?
japan 's economy could be on the verge of climbing out of recession , new government figures suggest .
the data could make life easier for beleaguered prime minister junichiro koizumi as he struggles to put together a fresh economic stimulus package .
the key number is the diffusion index , which puts together a range of indicators to come up with an estimate of whether growth or contraction is on the cards .
for the first time in 15 months the coincident index , measuring current performance , crept up from 40.0 in february to 56.3 in march , above the boom-or-bust dividing line of 50.0 .
and the leading index , intended to reflect predictions for the next three to six months , leapt to 80.0 , up from a revised 54.5 the previous month .
on the up the rise comes from an improvement in a basket of recent economic data .
this includes two straight months of gains in industrial output as the yen weakened and the global economy gathered pace .
consumer spending has also improved , a key factor in slowing the deflation which has gripped the economy for some years .
scepticism rules but even though the figures will come as a relief to the government , it still has to come up with a plan to ease the worst recession in japan since world war ii .
news reports suggest a package of measures including lower taxes on interest , capital gains , and gifts of assets by parents to children , and a broader sell-off of heavily-indebted public corporations could emerge as early as monday .
but domestic scepticism about mr koizumi 's government is still widespread , a far cry from the massive popularity he had earlier enjoyed .
hopes that mr koizumi would engage in genuine far-reaching reforms have faded since he sacked his foreign minister , makiko tanaka , earlier this year .
a number of scandals among ministers and senior figures in the ruling liberal democratic party have reinforced the sense that nothing has changed , and that party infighting remains more important than tackling japan 's massive financial problems .
going down and international scepticism is just as strong .
credit rating agency fitch shrugged off criticisms from japanese authorities after it downgraded government bonds last month .
the government had said the ' aa ' rating was the same as that awarded to a developing country with weak competitiveness , gaps in its industrial base , and an economy a third the size of japan 's .
fitch should explain the " analytical inconsistency " , said a letter from haruhiko kuroda , japan 's top financial diplomat .
fitch defended itself by saying that there were many more factors to be considered than those identified by mr kuroda - not least the question of the sustainability of public finances .
in a pointed reference to japan 's massive public debt of 140 % of national output , fitch president stephen joynt said that the public purse would continue to suffer despite huge foreign exchange reserves and high domestic savings .
" in the absence of corrective action , japan could be caught in a debt trap from which it can only escape through monetisation or default , " he wrote .

japan 's economy could be on the verge of climbing out of recession , new government figures suggest .
the data could make life easier for beleaguered prime minister junichiro koizumi as he struggles to put together a fresh economic stimulus package .
the key number is the diffusion index , which puts together a range of indicators to come up with an estimate of whether growth or contraction is on the cards .
for the first time in 15 months the coincident index , measuring current performance , crept up from 40.0 in february to 56.3 in march , above the boom-or-bust dividing line of 50.0 .
and the leading index , intended to reflect predictions for the next three to six months , leapt to 80.0 , up from a revised 54.5 the previous month .
on the up the rise comes from an improvement in a basket of recent economic data .
this includes two straight months of gains in industrial output as the yen weakened and the global economy gathered pace .
consumer spending has also improved , a key factor in slowing the deflation which has gripped the economy for some years .
scepticism rules but even though the figures will come as a relief to the government , it still has to come up with a plan to ease the worst recession in japan since world war ii .
news reports suggest a package of measures including lower taxes on interest , capital gains , and gifts of assets by parents to children , and a broader sell-off of heavily-indebted public corporations could emerge as early as monday .
but domestic scepticism about mr koizumi 's government is still widespread , a far cry from the massive popularity he had earlier enjoyed .
hopes that mr koizumi would engage in genuine far-reaching reforms have faded since he sacked his foreign minister , makiko tanaka , earlier this year .
a number of scandals among ministers and senior figures in the ruling liberal democratic party have reinforced the sense that nothing has changed , and that party infighting remains more important than tackling japan 's massive financial problems .
going down and international scepticism is just as strong .
credit rating agency fitch shrugged off criticisms from japanese authorities after it downgraded government bonds last month .
the government had said the ' aa ' rating was the same as that awarded to a developing country with weak competitiveness , gaps in its industrial base , and an economy a third the size of japan 's .
fitch should explain the " analytical inconsistency " , said a letter from haruhiko kuroda , japan 's top financial diplomat .
fitch defended itself by saying that there were many more factors to be considered than those identified by mr kuroda - not least the question of the sustainability of public finances .
in a pointed reference to japan 's massive public debt of 140 % of national output , fitch president stephen joynt said that the public purse would continue to suffer despite huge foreign exchange reserves and high domestic savings .
" in the absence of corrective action , japan could be caught in a debt trap from which it can only escape through monetisation or default , " he wrote .
" progress on structural reforms has , in our judgment , been slow . "

fragile recovery the dow had performed strongly during the first three months of the year amid signs of a strong economic recovery in the us , making up all of the ground lost after the 11 september attacks .

fears that initial forecasts of a quick economic rebound may have been over-optimistic put share values under added pressure .
the nasdaq index of technology stocks , which fell 2 % on monday alone , has also faltered in recent weeks .
high levels of corporate debt and persistently sluggish demand have sapped confidence in tech sector firms ' ability to deliver strong earnings growth in the months ahead .

" this is just a snapback rally .

the outlook for the wider us economy remains uncertain , with consumer spending showing signs of waning and business investment still weak .
rise and fall the dow hit an all-time high of about 11,700 in january 2000 before falling steeply as the bull market of the late 1990s , fuelled largely by a sharp rise in technology stocks , ran out of steam .
it first breached the 10,000 level as the tech boom was getting into its stride in march 1999 .
this threshold has been seen as a psychologically important level ever since , with a dip below 10,000 likely to dent investor confidence .
the nasdaq 's high watermark of about 5,000 came in march 2000 , but then slumped as the tech bubble deflated .

sir thomas allen said artists and producers who got attention for their image as much as their music were leading the public to think they were the best that classical music had to offer .
he warned that such artists are threatening the integrity of the profession , making it mediocre and turning it into a " money-grabbing , pr-led " exercise .
the targets of the international baritone 's attack say they are bringing a wider , younger audience to an area often seen as stuffy and boring .
" we have undoubtedly become a civilisation in rapid cultural decline , " sir thomas said at the royal philharmonic society -lrb- rps -rrb- awards .
" sugar-coated programming , or the recording of choice bits of easy listening , is a plague and has taken over a once respectable and serious profession to the point where integrity is almost wholly inundated , " he said . "
the idea of a wet t-shirted quartet where once was the amadeus has me reaching for the sea-sick pills " sir thomas allen " and i 'm sick and tired of hearing of those performers who talk of it as their life 's work to bring culture and the classics to a wider public as though they are a band of nursing sisters seeking to restore a terminally-ill patient . "
he said there was more integrity in a few bars of beethoven , schubert or mozart than in a hundred lifetimes of artists who say they are trying to modernise classical music .
" the idea of a wet t-shirted quartet where once was the amadeus has me reaching for the sea-sick pills , or even just retching , " he said .
sir thomas , who has previously hit out at some classical stars for " dumbing down " , gave the keynote speech at the ceremony at london 's dorchester hotel .
among the prizes handed out was singer of the year , which went to lithuanian mezzo-soprano violeta urmana .
she was commended for her performances in parsifal at london 's royal opera house and verdi 's requiem at london 's barbican .
channel 4 won the society 's radio , television and video award for its film biography of the legendary jazz musician miles davis , the miles davis story and the bbc 's scottish symphony orchestra also received top honours .
it won the award for the best large ensemble while the orchestra 's osmo vanska won the conductor 's award .
the rps music awards were founded in 1989 to recognise outstanding contributions in the field of music in the uk during the year .
urmana has performed all over the world and won several international awards in the last decade .
the rps praised her " for the extraordinary authority and vocal beauty of her performances " of her london roles .
channel 4 was praised for making what the society considered to be the first major authoritative film about miles davies .
the bbc 's scottish symphony orchestra was honoured for its " commitment to classical and contemporary music all over the uk " .
it added that in 2001 its chief conductor vanska - with the orchestra since 1996 - had given a " series of consistently excellent performances , particularly in the works of sibelius and nielsen " .
the awards were handed out by the legendary australian soprano dame joan sutherland .
the award for the year 's best large-scale composition went to peter eotvos ' opera three sisters .
the opera was premièred at the edinburgh festival in 2001 .
