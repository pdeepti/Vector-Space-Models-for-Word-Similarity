by bbc news online 's david chazan calls are growing for the return of antiquities - such as the ancient parthenon sculptures known as the elgin marbles - to their countries of origin .
a group of british celebrities and politicians has joined the greek campaign for britain to send back the elgin marbles - removed from athens two centuries ago by the british ambassador , lord elgin .
the question of whether western museums should be emptied in order to return artefacts to their countries of origin is not being discussed at all laurent levi-strauss the british government and the director of the british museum , where the 2,500-year-old friezes are displayed , have refused - arguing that they are being well cared for and have been seen by more people than if they had been returned to greece .
ethiopia is demanding the return from italy of one of its most famous monuments - an obelisk .
it was taken to italy on the orders of dictator benito mussolini more than 60 years ago when ethiopia was occupied by italy .
italy has agreed in principle to return the obelisk , but has not done so , expressing concern about possible damage during shipment .
have your say other countries which say they have suffered cultural losses include egypt , china , india , iraq , libya and syria .
the united nations cultural organisation says it is ready to help achieve a negotiated solution to such disputes .
laurent levi-strauss , deputy director of unesco 's division of cultural heritage , told news online that " support is growing among the general public and in governments for the return of objects which have been stolen or looted . "
but he added : " the question of whether western museums should be emptied in order to return artefacts to their countries of origin is not being discussed at all . " 19th century values nations victorious in war have often plundered the antiquities , treasures and works of art of their vanquished foes .
former colonial powers such as britain and france often justified their actions by arguing that they were better able to preserve the artefacts and make them available to scholars .
a 1970 unesco convention calls for the return of antiquities and works of art to their countries of origin , but does not apply to artefacts or objects taken to other countries before 1970 .
professor peter warren , a lecturer in ancient history and classical archaeology at bristol university in the uk , told news online that there has been a change of ethos .
" you have to pay attention to when any material was acquired , " he said .
" there was a completely different ethos in the 19th century . "
illicit plundering professor warren says that in the 20th century , the illicit looting of antiquities from their countries of origin and their sale to dealers or collectors had a disastrous effect on scholarship .
" when this happens , the history of a country is being destroyed , " he said .
" if you ca n't excavate things in their context , they become mere objects and it 's just a question of whether they look better on your mantelpiece or mine . "
the long years of war have not been kind to afghanistan 's cultural heritage .
its national museum has been repeatedly looted - and it is difficult for poor afghans to resist the temptation to dig up relics from historical sites , knowing that there is a rich market in wealthy countries for ancient artefacts .
jewel in the crown the taleban - internationally condemned for destroying buddhist statues - had demanded that the british royal family hand over part of its crown jewels - the koh-i-noor diamond .
the koh-i-noor came to the uk from india 150 years ago and was presented to queen victoria .
five countries - including pakistan , iran and india - lay claim to the jewel .
many artefacts in europe were destroyed , looted or lost during world war ii .
more recently , the balkan countries have suffered losses from war or looting , while the illicit trade in artefacts has severely depleted cambodia 's antiquities .
africa 's cultural treasures are also prized by international collectors - and are increasingly being plundered , experts say .
poor countries are especially vulnerable to the illegal trade in antiquities .

bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- lords plans to be shelved categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk politics front page world uk uk politics interviews business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 18 january , 2002 , 07:01 gmt lords plans to be shelved cook : wants a period of reflection plans for house of lords reform have been put on the back burner until next year .
the leader of the commons robin cook said government proposals on the number of elected peers had gone down badly in parliament and with the general public .
in the light of what we have heard so far and are likely to hear , that period of reflection should not be rushed robin cook and there now needed to be a " period of reflection " , which " should not be rushed , " in order to come up with a new set of proposals .
there is widespread anger among labour mps that only 20 % of peers would be elected under the government 's plans , contained in a white paper .
' dead duck ' responding to comments from labour peer lord lipsey that the proposals were now a " dead duck " , mr cook said : " i would fully accept that that the broad tenor of response to the consultation , both in parliament and outside parliament , has tended to suggest that most people think that this is not the correct proportion . "
the white paper had merely been a consultation document , mr cook told the public administration committee .
and although he " saw merit " in drawing up a draft bill based on the proposals contained in it , that would not now happen .
' serious risk ' he said it was important to use the period of reflection to " find a centre of gravity around which reforms can gather .
" the most serious risk is that we have a situation that we are unable to achieve a sufficient critical mass of agreement among those who want reform for any reform to take place .
" that is why reform of the house of lords has taken so long to achieve , " he told the committee .
professional politicians mr cook said an entirely elected upper chamber would threaten the authority of the commons .
it would also be wrong to rule out appointees , as there were suitable candidates who might not want to put themselves through the ordeal of an election .
similarly , it was wrong to believe politicians were unsuitable just because they had party allegiances .
" i have been a professional politician for 30 years and i am not ashamed of it , " mr cook told the committee .
conservative proposals mr cook said conservative proposals for an entirely elected second chamber were " interesting " but had their own problems .
" we would wish to hear more about it , " he said .
on the length of time it would take to come up with new proposals , mr cook told mps : " in the light of what we have heard so far and are likely to hear , that period of reflection should not be rushed . "

the leader of the commons robin cook said government proposals on the number of elected peers had gone down badly in parliament and with the general public .
in the light of what we have heard so far and are likely to hear , that period of reflection should not be rushed robin cook and there now needed to be a " period of reflection " , which " should not be rushed , " in order to come up with a new set of proposals .
there is widespread anger among labour mps that only 20 % of peers would be elected under the government 's plans , contained in a white paper .
' dead duck ' responding to comments from labour peer lord lipsey that the proposals were now a " dead duck " , mr cook said : " i would fully accept that that the broad tenor of response to the consultation , both in parliament and outside parliament , has tended to suggest that most people think that this is not the correct proportion . "
the white paper had merely been a consultation document , mr cook told the public administration committee .
and although he " saw merit " in drawing up a draft bill based on the proposals contained in it , that would not now happen .
' serious risk ' he said it was important to use the period of reflection to " find a centre of gravity around which reforms can gather .
" the most serious risk is that we have a situation that we are unable to achieve a sufficient critical mass of agreement among those who want reform for any reform to take place .
" that is why reform of the house of lords has taken so long to achieve , " he told the committee .
professional politicians mr cook said an entirely elected upper chamber would threaten the authority of the commons .
it would also be wrong to rule out appointees , as there were suitable candidates who might not want to put themselves through the ordeal of an election .
similarly , it was wrong to believe politicians were unsuitable just because they had party allegiances .
" i have been a professional politician for 30 years and i am not ashamed of it , " mr cook told the committee .
conservative proposals mr cook said conservative proposals for an entirely elected second chamber were " interesting " but had their own problems .
" we would wish to hear more about it , " he said .
on the length of time it would take to come up with new proposals , mr cook told mps : " in the light of what we have heard so far and are likely to hear , that period of reflection should not be rushed . "
earlier mr cook told the bbc that consultation on the government 's white paper would continue until 31 january , but there would be no legislation in the current parliamentary session , which ends in november .

in a speech in birmingham mr duncan smith said that all his party 's policies were being reviewed - although he insisted that the party 's core values remained the same .
the problems may have changed , but the values that underpin our solutions are as relevant as ever iain duncan smith the core principles he outlined were independence , freedom , choice , enterprise and security .
the event coincided with remarks from tory frontbencher john bercow that the conservatives were seen as racist , sexist , homophobic and anti-youth , and must " change our ways " .
a tory spokesman insisted that , taken as a whole , the four-page letter in which mr bercow made his comments was " hugely supportive of iain and a stringent attack on the government " .
mr duncan smith told an audience of businessmen and women : " the way we develop policy will be characterised by leadership and direction , and based firmly on conservative values .
our values have stood the test of time . "
' policy from principle ' he added : " the problems may have changed , but the values that underpin our solutions are as relevant as ever . "
under the slogan " policy from principle " , he accused tony blair 's government of having a top-down approach which leaves it vulnerable to the " glamour of grand schemes and global solutions " .
we must recognise that we sounded shrill , paranoid and even nasty shadow chief secretary john bercow " my instincts are always to build from the bottom up : to derive policy from the instincts and values of the people we represent , guided by our own values . "
he said that , unlike labour , the tories were confident about the future of the uk because they were comfortable with its past .
ahead of the speech , party chairman david davis conceded that the tories had fared terribly at the polls over the last two general elections .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " what -lsb- mr bercow -rsb- was doing was looking ... at the two worst election results in modern history for our party .
" that 's what he was talking about , saying we were in a terrible state .
we have had terrible outcomes and what we have to do therefore is review what we are doing and come back and deal with it properly . "
mr davis went on to attack labour for " suffering the political equivalent of a nervous breakdown with one secretary of state -lsb- stephen byers -rsb- renationalising the railways while -lsb- health secretary alan milburn -rsb- tries to privatise part of the nhs . "
he then reaffirmed previous comments by shadow chancellor michael howard that the tories would not cut taxes if that meant a knock-on cut in public services .
" but the essential tory issue is that if you have a low tax economy it grows faster and you have more money available to spend on public services , " the conservative chairman insisted .
mr howard told bbc radio 4 's the world at one that the tories still believed a " low taxation " economy was best for society .
but he added : " there are times when you have such a crisis somewhere else , that has to be addressed as a matter of priority - and that is the position with our public services at the present time . "
labour ' getting it right ' labour party chairman charles clarke said the conservatives were providing more questions than answers on public services .
" we can all agree with much of -lrb- the tory 's -rrb- rhetoric and the language but what politics has to be about is indicating how we are going to face up to making those things happen .
" and that is what we are trying to do , i think generally succesfully .
sometimes we do n't get it right , but what the tories have to do is answer these same questions themselves , " he told the world at one .
' grotesquely unrepresentative ' according to the times newspaper , mr bercow wrote in his letter to party members in his buckingham constituency that the tories must change if they want to win the next election .
" even when we were right ... we must recognise that we sounded shrill , paranoid and even nasty , " he said .
" we are grotesquely unrepresentative of the public at large and many conservative-minded women recoil from joining our ranks . "

prime minister tony blair has made it clear he is already thinking about an alternative career , after he has left number 10 .
in an interview with bbc radio 5 live , mr blair said it was " an absolute privilege to be doing this job " and he had no immediate plans to quit .
-lrb- it would -rrb- be extremely foolish of me to share it with you , just quite at this moment mr blair on his future plans but when it was suggested that , as a relatively young man , he must have given some thought to what he will do next , he said " you are probably right . "
but , he added , it would be " extremely foolish of me to share it with you , just quite at this moment . "
asked to expand , the prime minister laughed and said : " i have n't said more than i should have done - but i am not saying any more than i have said . "
' pact ' with cherie mr blair has always refused to discuss when he might stand down as labour leader , despite media speculation about a supposed " deal " with chancellor gordon brown .
mr major : a passion for cricket according to a tv documentary last year , mr blair has also made a pact with his wife cherie to stand down after two terms , to allow mrs blair to pursue her flourishing legal career .
the claim was made in channel 4 's the real cherie blair , by linda mcdougall , wife of labour mp austin mitchell , who wrote an accompanying biography of mrs blair .

" i think his preference is to surprise us .

it might be too late for a career in football given his profile on the world stage , mr blair would be unlikely to return to his former career as a barrister specializing in employment law .
a return to the backbenches would seem equally unlikely , although most former prime ministers have tended to remain within the political arena .
