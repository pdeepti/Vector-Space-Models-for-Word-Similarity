critics fear that the new rules would water down the tribunal . an increasingly chilly transatlantic relationship underwent a major thawing on monday as the european union finally reached an agreement with washington over the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , ending weeks of wrangling .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , approved a set of " guidelines " under which member states , if they so wish , can agree not to hand over americans suspected of war crimes to the icc .
per stig moeller , the foreign minister of denmark , which holds the rotating eu presidency , denied that the new rules would water down the international tribunal .
" there is no concession , " he said .
" there is no undermining of the international criminal court . "
icc treaty undermined ?
despite those strong words , all eu states agree in principle that the immunity deals , as sought by the united states , flout the tribunal ’ s founding treaty .
the icc , which is due to start its work in the hague next year , will try individuals for genocide , atrocities , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses .
washington , which fears its soldiers and officials overseas could be vulnerable to politically motivated charges , has strongly opposed the international criminal court .
it has lobbied icc signatories for months to sign " immunity agreements " under which they would agree not to hand any us citizen over to the tribunal .
so far 12 non-eu countries have done so .

however , germany remains the only country to remain openly hostile to the principle of keeping americans out of the court ’ s reach , undaunted by its own recent nose-diving relations with the united states .
germany made it clear that it would definitely not be signing such a deal .
" people are looking to europe , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters .
" what matters is that the europeans stand together on the basis of a strengthening of the court ’ s statute .
what matters to us is not to assuage anyone . "
eu compromise under scathing criticism but the eu ’ s compromise has come under fire from critics who say that the eu move is a climb-down and that the 15-nation-bloc has papered over its own fundamental disagreements on the issue to end a tense stand-off with no guarantee that the united states would agree to its proposals .
in a statement , dick oosting , director of amnesty international ’ s eu office said " us pressure has paid off .
the eu has allowed the us to shift the terms of the debate from legal principle to political opportunism . "

and like the previous four years of government , the talks take place amid the sober reality of germany ’ s current economic misery . the two partners are faced with an unemployment rate that is likely to go up , not down , in the coming year , an ever-rising debt and a bloated social welfare system in bad need of reform . their response , at least after the first day of talks , has been to maintain a strict savings course in face of a 10 billion euro budget deficit and begin eliminating state subsidies . ” we will not leave our consolidation course , ” fritz kuhn , chairman of the green party , told reporters . read my lips : no new tax hikes kuhn and his neogtiating partners also ended speculation that the new red-green coalition , named after the colors identified with the two parties , would raise taxes to increase the government 's paltry income . tax money this year is already 3.5 percent less than last year and state spending is putting germany on bad terms with its european union neighbors .
should debt increase , germany will break an eu rule that debt should be no more than 3 percent of annual gross domestic product - a rule the country helped craft . social democratic state premiers had suggested over the weekend hikes in property , inheritance and the tobacco tax were necessary in order to change germany 's miserable economic situation . the suggestion caused an uproar in the opposition parties and among the country 's editorialists alike .
finance experts said taxation would be " poison " for germany 's economic turnaround . chancellor gerhard schröder said monday night that talk of tax hikes was " very annoying " .
he said the coalition negotiations would focus on cutting subsidies and eliminating " excess " tax priveleges and subsidies . labor market reform , but when ? some coalition politicians and financial experts say a little trimming here and there wo n't solve germany 's slow growth and unemployment , which is now hovering between 4.5 and 4.7 million . the country 's over-regulated labor market and massive social security costs have laid a heavy burden on the economic turnaround . schröder used an august report by a commission of experts headed by volkswagen board member peter hartz to soothe voters ' fears in the final weeks leading up to the election . but experts doubt all of the recommendations made by the commission can be applied .
many have been criticized by industry leaders .
should schröder try to implement any of industry 's labor market recommendations he will run into problems with the unions , who helped him keep his job . schröder already made clear that among the subsidies to be cut , the coal industry 's 2.78 billion euro subsidy wo n't be among them . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.10.2002 god via satellite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything revolves around the bible in germany 's first christian channel , bibel tv bibel tv - germany ’ s first solely christian television channel goes on air on october 1 .
it hopes to grab the attention of church-weary germans and capitalise on a reawakened interest in spirituality . young people in germany may be turning their backs on the church , but that hasn ’ t stopped the booming popularity of christian media and especially christian music in the country , whether it ’ s gospel , soul or heavy metal .
theologians are speaking of a new awakened spirituality in germany , a trend towards " moral meaning " in life , need for tranquillity , balance and a new metaphysics of the mystery of life .
it may all sound a bit esoteric , but the team behind germany ’ s first digital niche christian channel is convinced that beaming god 's message directly into living rooms is the formula to success .
under the motto " i believe .
i see " , bibel tv hopes to bring the holy scriptures closer to the people .
interest in things spiritual rekindled " the churches here -lrb- in germany -rrb- have an incredible deficit of young people , " henning röhl , executive director of the non-profit bibel tv foundation ltd and himself a member of the german lutheran church -lrb- ekd -rrb- told the german newspaper , berliner morgenpost .
" at the same time there ’ s a strong religious atmosphere in germany , a newly awakened spirituality that ’ s overwhelming , " he said .
bibel tv now plans to cash in on these church-disillusioned but spiritually-awake young people with a funky programme for the video-clip-dance generation .
a viva-version with a difference " we want to become a christian viva or mtv , " röhl told the german newspaper " die welt " .
indeed , music will take much of the air time on bibel tv .
called " jericho .
music that transforms " , the music programme won ’ t just play spiritual and choral music by bach , but also gospel songs and modern rock such as the us band p.o.d. and pop music with a christian relevance .
younger viewers will be treated to cartoon characters radiantly singing hymns and narrating stories from the bible .
the rest of air time will be taken up by everything from the genesis to apocalypse as prominent actors read from the bible , theologians debate on where christianity is headed , children ’ s programmes , quizzes , documentaries , movies and small quotes from the bible turn up on trailers .
the genesis of bibel tv a phenomenon long common in other european countries and in america , a niche religion channel is a first for germany .
some five christian television channels already exist in great britain and they ’ re popular in holland too .
the idea for germany ’ s first christian channel was born five years ago in a hotel room as the controversial publisher from bonn and self-made millionaire , normann rentrop happened to pick up the bible and began to read it .
since then he hasn ’ t managed to shake off the influence of the book of all books .
" everyday i find answers and comfort to problems " , he was reported as saying .
rentrop since has been seized by the desire to bring the holy scriptures closer to all of germany .
he hit upon the idea of a christian channel as an antidote to other channels that constantly show " murder and mystery films " .
rentrop also believes that television is the ideal medium for god ’ s message .
" we germans spend some 20 percent of our time on an average in front of the television , " he says on the bibel tv website .
rentrop pulled off a coup when he roped in the media-experienced 59-year-old henning röhl , former boss of german public broadcasters ard and mdr , to head the bibel tv team .
finances could cause a headache financing will however remain a big concern for the bibel tv initiative .
though rentrop ’ s own non-profit foundation pumped some 12 million euro into the project , röhl can reckon with just 500,000 to 750,000 euro per year for the channel that will be beamed over the digital astra satellite into an estimated 1,2 to 1,8 million german-speaking households .
rentrop hopes that bibel tv will be able to finance itself in three years through advertising revenues .
his team is open to all kinds of advertising ventures expect those related to telephone sex numbers and the kind .
" the advertising must be complementary to the programme , " he says .
no proselytising the bibel tv team is also clear that its aim is not to proselytise or end up being a missionary television channel .
after all " religious advertising " is strictly forbidden under german media laws .
that ’ s also the reason why bibel tv will not be broadcasting any mass or sermons in the country .

it hopes to grab the attention of church-weary germans and capitalise on a reawakened interest in spirituality . young people in germany may be turning their backs on the church , but that hasn ’ t stopped the booming popularity of christian media and especially christian music in the country , whether it ’ s gospel , soul or heavy metal .
theologians are speaking of a new awakened spirituality in germany , a trend towards " moral meaning " in life , need for tranquillity , balance and a new metaphysics of the mystery of life .
it may all sound a bit esoteric , but the team behind germany ’ s first digital niche christian channel is convinced that beaming god 's message directly into living rooms is the formula to success .
under the motto " i believe .
i see " , bibel tv hopes to bring the holy scriptures closer to the people .
interest in things spiritual rekindled " the churches here -lrb- in germany -rrb- have an incredible deficit of young people , " henning röhl , executive director of the non-profit bibel tv foundation ltd and himself a member of the german lutheran church -lrb- ekd -rrb- told the german newspaper , berliner morgenpost .
" at the same time there ’ s a strong religious atmosphere in germany , a newly awakened spirituality that ’ s overwhelming , " he said .
bibel tv now plans to cash in on these church-disillusioned but spiritually-awake young people with a funky programme for the video-clip-dance generation .
a viva-version with a difference " we want to become a christian viva or mtv , " röhl told the german newspaper " die welt " .
indeed , music will take much of the air time on bibel tv .
called " jericho .
music that transforms " , the music programme won ’ t just play spiritual and choral music by bach , but also gospel songs and modern rock such as the us band p.o.d. and pop music with a christian relevance .
younger viewers will be treated to cartoon characters radiantly singing hymns and narrating stories from the bible .
the rest of air time will be taken up by everything from the genesis to apocalypse as prominent actors read from the bible , theologians debate on where christianity is headed , children ’ s programmes , quizzes , documentaries , movies and small quotes from the bible turn up on trailers .
the genesis of bibel tv a phenomenon long common in other european countries and in america , a niche religion channel is a first for germany .
some five christian television channels already exist in great britain and they ’ re popular in holland too .
the idea for germany ’ s first christian channel was born five years ago in a hotel room as the controversial publisher from bonn and self-made millionaire , normann rentrop happened to pick up the bible and began to read it .
since then he hasn ’ t managed to shake off the influence of the book of all books .
" everyday i find answers and comfort to problems " , he was reported as saying .
rentrop since has been seized by the desire to bring the holy scriptures closer to all of germany .
he hit upon the idea of a christian channel as an antidote to other channels that constantly show " murder and mystery films " .
rentrop also believes that television is the ideal medium for god ’ s message .
" we germans spend some 20 percent of our time on an average in front of the television , " he says on the bibel tv website .
rentrop pulled off a coup when he roped in the media-experienced 59-year-old henning röhl , former boss of german public broadcasters ard and mdr , to head the bibel tv team .
finances could cause a headache financing will however remain a big concern for the bibel tv initiative .
though rentrop ’ s own non-profit foundation pumped some 12 million euro into the project , röhl can reckon with just 500,000 to 750,000 euro per year for the channel that will be beamed over the digital astra satellite into an estimated 1,2 to 1,8 million german-speaking households .
rentrop hopes that bibel tv will be able to finance itself in three years through advertising revenues .
his team is open to all kinds of advertising ventures expect those related to telephone sex numbers and the kind .
" the advertising must be complementary to the programme , " he says .
no proselytising the bibel tv team is also clear that its aim is not to proselytise or end up being a missionary television channel .
after all " religious advertising " is strictly forbidden under german media laws .
that ’ s also the reason why bibel tv will not be broadcasting any mass or sermons in the country .

critics fear that the new rules would water down the tribunal . an increasingly chilly transatlantic relationship underwent a major thawing on monday as the european union finally reached an agreement with washington over the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , ending weeks of wrangling .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , approved a set of " guidelines " under which member states , if they so wish , can agree not to hand over americans suspected of war crimes to the icc .

despite those strong words , all eu states agree in principle that the immunity deals , as sought by the united states , flout the tribunal ’ s founding treaty .
the icc , which is due to start its work in the hague next year , will try individuals for genocide , atrocities , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses .
washington , which fears its soldiers and officials overseas could be vulnerable to politically motivated charges , has strongly opposed the international criminal court .

germany made it clear that it would definitely not be signing such a deal .

and like the previous four years of government , the talks take place amid the sober reality of germany ’ s current economic misery . the two partners are faced with an unemployment rate that is likely to go up , not down , in the coming year , an ever-rising debt and a bloated social welfare system in bad need of reform . their response , at least after the first day of talks , has been to maintain a strict savings course in face of a 10 billion euro budget deficit and begin eliminating state subsidies . ” we will not leave our consolidation course , ” fritz kuhn , chairman of the green party , told reporters . read my lips : no new tax hikes kuhn and his neogtiating partners also ended speculation that the new red-green coalition , named after the colors identified with the two parties , would raise taxes to increase the government 's paltry income . tax money this year is already 3.5 percent less than last year and state spending is putting germany on bad terms with its european union neighbors .
should debt increase , germany will break an eu rule that debt should be no more than 3 percent of annual gross domestic product - a rule the country helped craft . social democratic state premiers had suggested over the weekend hikes in property , inheritance and the tobacco tax were necessary in order to change germany 's miserable economic situation . the suggestion caused an uproar in the opposition parties and among the country 's editorialists alike .
finance experts said taxation would be " poison " for germany 's economic turnaround . chancellor gerhard schröder said monday night that talk of tax hikes was " very annoying " .
he said the coalition negotiations would focus on cutting subsidies and eliminating " excess " tax priveleges and subsidies . labor market reform , but when ? some coalition politicians and financial experts say a little trimming here and there wo n't solve germany 's slow growth and unemployment , which is now hovering between 4.5 and 4.7 million . the country 's over-regulated labor market and massive social security costs have laid a heavy burden on the economic turnaround . schröder used an august report by a commission of experts headed by volkswagen board member peter hartz to soothe voters ' fears in the final weeks leading up to the election . but experts doubt all of the recommendations made by the commission can be applied .
many have been criticized by industry leaders .
should schröder try to implement any of industry 's labor market recommendations he will run into problems with the unions , who helped him keep his job . schröder already made clear that among the subsidies to be cut , the coal industry 's 2.78 billion euro subsidy wo n't be among them . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .
they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.10.2002 god via satellite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything revolves around the bible in germany 's first christian channel , bibel tv bibel tv - germany ’ s first solely christian television channel goes on air on october 1 .
it hopes to grab the attention of church-weary germans and capitalise on a reawakened interest in spirituality . young people in germany may be turning their backs on the church , but that hasn ’ t stopped the booming popularity of christian media and especially christian music in the country , whether it ’ s gospel , soul or heavy metal .
theologians are speaking of a new awakened spirituality in germany , a trend towards " moral meaning " in life , need for tranquillity , balance and a new metaphysics of the mystery of life .
it may all sound a bit esoteric , but the team behind germany ’ s first digital niche christian channel is convinced that beaming god 's message directly into living rooms is the formula to success .
under the motto " i believe .
i see " , bibel tv hopes to bring the holy scriptures closer to the people .
interest in things spiritual rekindled " the churches here -lrb- in germany -rrb- have an incredible deficit of young people , " henning röhl , executive director of the non-profit bibel tv foundation ltd and himself a member of the german lutheran church -lrb- ekd -rrb- told the german newspaper , berliner morgenpost .
" at the same time there ’ s a strong religious atmosphere in germany , a newly awakened spirituality that ’ s overwhelming , " he said .
bibel tv now plans to cash in on these church-disillusioned but spiritually-awake young people with a funky programme for the video-clip-dance generation .
a viva-version with a difference " we want to become a christian viva or mtv , " röhl told the german newspaper " die welt " .
indeed , music will take much of the air time on bibel tv .
called " jericho .
music that transforms " , the music programme won ’ t just play spiritual and choral music by bach , but also gospel songs and modern rock such as the us band p.o.d. and pop music with a christian relevance .
younger viewers will be treated to cartoon characters radiantly singing hymns and narrating stories from the bible .
the rest of air time will be taken up by everything from the genesis to apocalypse as prominent actors read from the bible , theologians debate on where christianity is headed , children ’ s programmes , quizzes , documentaries , movies and small quotes from the bible turn up on trailers .
the genesis of bibel tv a phenomenon long common in other european countries and in america , a niche religion channel is a first for germany .
some five christian television channels already exist in great britain and they ’ re popular in holland too .
the idea for germany ’ s first christian channel was born five years ago in a hotel room as the controversial publisher from bonn and self-made millionaire , normann rentrop happened to pick up the bible and began to read it .
since then he hasn ’ t managed to shake off the influence of the book of all books .
" everyday i find answers and comfort to problems " , he was reported as saying .
rentrop since has been seized by the desire to bring the holy scriptures closer to all of germany .
he hit upon the idea of a christian channel as an antidote to other channels that constantly show " murder and mystery films " .
rentrop also believes that television is the ideal medium for god ’ s message .
" we germans spend some 20 percent of our time on an average in front of the television , " he says on the bibel tv website .
rentrop pulled off a coup when he roped in the media-experienced 59-year-old henning röhl , former boss of german public broadcasters ard and mdr , to head the bibel tv team .
finances could cause a headache financing will however remain a big concern for the bibel tv initiative .
though rentrop ’ s own non-profit foundation pumped some 12 million euro into the project , röhl can reckon with just 500,000 to 750,000 euro per year for the channel that will be beamed over the digital astra satellite into an estimated 1,2 to 1,8 million german-speaking households .
rentrop hopes that bibel tv will be able to finance itself in three years through advertising revenues .
his team is open to all kinds of advertising ventures expect those related to telephone sex numbers and the kind .
" the advertising must be complementary to the programme , " he says .
no proselytising the bibel tv team is also clear that its aim is not to proselytise or end up being a missionary television channel .
after all " religious advertising " is strictly forbidden under german media laws .
that ’ s also the reason why bibel tv will not be broadcasting any mass or sermons in the country .
and though both the german lutheran church and the catholic church are involved in the project , church authorities are clear that not a cent of church taxes will be diverted to the project . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links bibel tv -lrb- only in german -rrb- media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.10.2002 god via satellite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything revolves around the bible in germany 's first christian channel , bibel tv bibel tv - germany ’ s first solely christian television channel goes on air on october 1 .
it hopes to grab the attention of church-weary germans and capitalise on a reawakened interest in spirituality . young people in germany may be turning their backs on the church , but that hasn ’ t stopped the booming popularity of christian media and especially christian music in the country , whether it ’ s gospel , soul or heavy metal .
theologians are speaking of a new awakened spirituality in germany , a trend towards " moral meaning " in life , need for tranquillity , balance and a new metaphysics of the mystery of life .
it may all sound a bit esoteric , but the team behind germany ’ s first digital niche christian channel is convinced that beaming god 's message directly into living rooms is the formula to success .
under the motto " i believe .
i see " , bibel tv hopes to bring the holy scriptures closer to the people .
interest in things spiritual rekindled " the churches here -lrb- in germany -rrb- have an incredible deficit of young people , " henning röhl , executive director of the non-profit bibel tv foundation ltd and himself a member of the german lutheran church -lrb- ekd -rrb- told the german newspaper , berliner morgenpost .
" at the same time there ’ s a strong religious atmosphere in germany , a newly awakened spirituality that ’ s overwhelming , " he said .
bibel tv now plans to cash in on these church-disillusioned but spiritually-awake young people with a funky programme for the video-clip-dance generation .
a viva-version with a difference " we want to become a christian viva or mtv , " röhl told the german newspaper " die welt " .
indeed , music will take much of the air time on bibel tv .
called " jericho .
music that transforms " , the music programme won ’ t just play spiritual and choral music by bach , but also gospel songs and modern rock such as the us band p.o.d. and pop music with a christian relevance .
younger viewers will be treated to cartoon characters radiantly singing hymns and narrating stories from the bible .
the rest of air time will be taken up by everything from the genesis to apocalypse as prominent actors read from the bible , theologians debate on where christianity is headed , children ’ s programmes , quizzes , documentaries , movies and small quotes from the bible turn up on trailers .
the genesis of bibel tv a phenomenon long common in other european countries and in america , a niche religion channel is a first for germany .
some five christian television channels already exist in great britain and they ’ re popular in holland too .
the idea for germany ’ s first christian channel was born five years ago in a hotel room as the controversial publisher from bonn and self-made millionaire , normann rentrop happened to pick up the bible and began to read it .
since then he hasn ’ t managed to shake off the influence of the book of all books .
" everyday i find answers and comfort to problems " , he was reported as saying .
rentrop since has been seized by the desire to bring the holy scriptures closer to all of germany .
he hit upon the idea of a christian channel as an antidote to other channels that constantly show " murder and mystery films " .
rentrop also believes that television is the ideal medium for god ’ s message .
" we germans spend some 20 percent of our time on an average in front of the television , " he says on the bibel tv website .
rentrop pulled off a coup when he roped in the media-experienced 59-year-old henning röhl , former boss of german public broadcasters ard and mdr , to head the bibel tv team .
finances could cause a headache financing will however remain a big concern for the bibel tv initiative .
though rentrop ’ s own non-profit foundation pumped some 12 million euro into the project , röhl can reckon with just 500,000 to 750,000 euro per year for the channel that will be beamed over the digital astra satellite into an estimated 1,2 to 1,8 million german-speaking households .
rentrop hopes that bibel tv will be able to finance itself in three years through advertising revenues .
his team is open to all kinds of advertising ventures expect those related to telephone sex numbers and the kind .
" the advertising must be complementary to the programme , " he says .
no proselytising the bibel tv team is also clear that its aim is not to proselytise or end up being a missionary television channel .
after all " religious advertising " is strictly forbidden under german media laws .
that ’ s also the reason why bibel tv will not be broadcasting any mass or sermons in the country .
and though both the german lutheran church and the catholic church are involved in the project , church authorities are clear that not a cent of church taxes will be diverted to the project . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links bibel tv -lrb- only in german -rrb- media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

critics fear that the new rules would water down the tribunal . an increasingly chilly transatlantic relationship underwent a major thawing on monday as the european union finally reached an agreement with washington over the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , ending weeks of wrangling .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , approved a set of " guidelines " under which member states , if they so wish , can agree not to hand over americans suspected of war crimes to the icc .

despite those strong words , all eu states agree in principle that the immunity deals , as sought by the united states , flout the tribunal ’ s founding treaty .
the icc , which is due to start its work in the hague next year , will try individuals for genocide , atrocities , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses .

germany made it clear that it would definitely not be signing such a deal .

it hopes to grab the attention of church-weary germans and capitalise on a reawakened interest in spirituality . young people in germany may be turning their backs on the church , but that hasn ’ t stopped the booming popularity of christian media and especially christian music in the country , whether it ’ s gospel , soul or heavy metal .
theologians are speaking of a new awakened spirituality in germany , a trend towards " moral meaning " in life , need for tranquillity , balance and a new metaphysics of the mystery of life .
it may all sound a bit esoteric , but the team behind germany ’ s first digital niche christian channel is convinced that beaming god 's message directly into living rooms is the formula to success .
under the motto " i believe .
i see " , bibel tv hopes to bring the holy scriptures closer to the people .
interest in things spiritual rekindled " the churches here -lrb- in germany -rrb- have an incredible deficit of young people , " henning röhl , executive director of the non-profit bibel tv foundation ltd and himself a member of the german lutheran church -lrb- ekd -rrb- told the german newspaper , berliner morgenpost .
" at the same time there ’ s a strong religious atmosphere in germany , a newly awakened spirituality that ’ s overwhelming , " he said .
bibel tv now plans to cash in on these church-disillusioned but spiritually-awake young people with a funky programme for the video-clip-dance generation .
a viva-version with a difference " we want to become a christian viva or mtv , " röhl told the german newspaper " die welt " .
indeed , music will take much of the air time on bibel tv .
called " jericho .
music that transforms " , the music programme won ’ t just play spiritual and choral music by bach , but also gospel songs and modern rock such as the us band p.o.d. and pop music with a christian relevance .
younger viewers will be treated to cartoon characters radiantly singing hymns and narrating stories from the bible .
the rest of air time will be taken up by everything from the genesis to apocalypse as prominent actors read from the bible , theologians debate on where christianity is headed , children ’ s programmes , quizzes , documentaries , movies and small quotes from the bible turn up on trailers .
the genesis of bibel tv a phenomenon long common in other european countries and in america , a niche religion channel is a first for germany .
some five christian television channels already exist in great britain and they ’ re popular in holland too .
the idea for germany ’ s first christian channel was born five years ago in a hotel room as the controversial publisher from bonn and self-made millionaire , normann rentrop happened to pick up the bible and began to read it .
since then he hasn ’ t managed to shake off the influence of the book of all books .
" everyday i find answers and comfort to problems " , he was reported as saying .
rentrop since has been seized by the desire to bring the holy scriptures closer to all of germany .
he hit upon the idea of a christian channel as an antidote to other channels that constantly show " murder and mystery films " .
rentrop also believes that television is the ideal medium for god ’ s message .
" we germans spend some 20 percent of our time on an average in front of the television , " he says on the bibel tv website .
rentrop pulled off a coup when he roped in the media-experienced 59-year-old henning röhl , former boss of german public broadcasters ard and mdr , to head the bibel tv team .
finances could cause a headache financing will however remain a big concern for the bibel tv initiative .
though rentrop ’ s own non-profit foundation pumped some 12 million euro into the project , röhl can reckon with just 500,000 to 750,000 euro per year for the channel that will be beamed over the digital astra satellite into an estimated 1,2 to 1,8 million german-speaking households .
rentrop hopes that bibel tv will be able to finance itself in three years through advertising revenues .
his team is open to all kinds of advertising ventures expect those related to telephone sex numbers and the kind .
" the advertising must be complementary to the programme , " he says .
no proselytising the bibel tv team is also clear that its aim is not to proselytise or end up being a missionary television channel .
after all " religious advertising " is strictly forbidden under german media laws .
that ’ s also the reason why bibel tv will not be broadcasting any mass or sermons in the country .
and though both the german lutheran church and the catholic church are involved in the project , church authorities are clear that not a cent of church taxes will be diverted to the project . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links bibel tv -lrb- only in german -rrb- 9799 dw-tv europe live talking germany we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.10.2002 eu climbs down on international criminal court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a subject of transatlantic tension - the international criminal court the european union has agreed on guidelines for bilateral agreements that exempt us troops from prosecution before the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- .
critics fear that the new rules would water down the tribunal . an increasingly chilly transatlantic relationship underwent a major thawing on monday as the european union finally reached an agreement with washington over the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , ending weeks of wrangling .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , approved a set of " guidelines " under which member states , if they so wish , can agree not to hand over americans suspected of war crimes to the icc .
per stig moeller , the foreign minister of denmark , which holds the rotating eu presidency , denied that the new rules would water down the international tribunal .
" there is no concession , " he said .
" there is no undermining of the international criminal court . "
icc treaty undermined ?
despite those strong words , all eu states agree in principle that the immunity deals , as sought by the united states , flout the tribunal ’ s founding treaty .
the icc , which is due to start its work in the hague next year , will try individuals for genocide , atrocities , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses .
washington , which fears its soldiers and officials overseas could be vulnerable to politically motivated charges , has strongly opposed the international criminal court .
it has lobbied icc signatories for months to sign " immunity agreements " under which they would agree not to hand any us citizen over to the tribunal .
so far 12 non-eu countries have done so .
germany sticks to its line with the eu ’ s caving in , britain , italy and spain , two of president bush ’ s staunchest allies are expected to begin negotiations with the united states on an agreement not to hand over certain categories of american citizens to face the new court .
however , germany remains the only country to remain openly hostile to the principle of keeping americans out of the court ’ s reach , undaunted by its own recent nose-diving relations with the united states .
germany made it clear that it would definitely not be signing such a deal .
" people are looking to europe , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters .
" what matters is that the europeans stand together on the basis of a strengthening of the court ’ s statute .
what matters to us is not to assuage anyone . "
eu compromise under scathing criticism but the eu ’ s compromise has come under fire from critics who say that the eu move is a climb-down and that the 15-nation-bloc has papered over its own fundamental disagreements on the issue to end a tense stand-off with no guarantee that the united states would agree to its proposals .
in a statement , dick oosting , director of amnesty international ’ s eu office said " us pressure has paid off .
the eu has allowed the us to shift the terms of the debate from legal principle to political opportunism . "
richard dicker of the new york-based lobby group human rights watch said the eu ’ s compromise " suggests a retreat by the eu from its strong common position for the icc .

music that transforms " , the music programme won ’ t just play spiritual and choral music by bach , but also gospel songs and modern rock such as the us band p.o.d. and pop music with a christian relevance .

the genesis of bibel tv a phenomenon long common in other european countries and in america , a niche religion channel is a first for germany .
some five christian television channels already exist in great britain and they ’ re popular in holland too .
the idea for germany ’ s first christian channel was born five years ago in a hotel room as the controversial publisher from bonn and self-made millionaire , normann rentrop happened to pick up the bible and began to read it .
since then he hasn ’ t managed to shake off the influence of the book of all books .
" everyday i find answers and comfort to problems " , he was reported as saying .
rentrop since has been seized by the desire to bring the holy scriptures closer to all of germany .
he hit upon the idea of a christian channel as an antidote to other channels that constantly show " murder and mystery films " .
rentrop also believes that television is the ideal medium for god ’ s message .
" we germans spend some 20 percent of our time on an average in front of the television , " he says on the bibel tv website .
rentrop pulled off a coup when he roped in the media-experienced 59-year-old henning röhl , former boss of german public broadcasters ard and mdr , to head the bibel tv team .
finances could cause a headache financing will however remain a big concern for the bibel tv initiative .
though rentrop ’ s own non-profit foundation pumped some 12 million euro into the project , röhl can reckon with just 500,000 to 750,000 euro per year for the channel that will be beamed over the digital astra satellite into an estimated 1,2 to 1,8 million german-speaking households .
rentrop hopes that bibel tv will be able to finance itself in three years through advertising revenues .
his team is open to all kinds of advertising ventures expect those related to telephone sex numbers and the kind .
" the advertising must be complementary to the programme , " he says .
no proselytising the bibel tv team is also clear that its aim is not to proselytise or end up being a missionary television channel .
after all " religious advertising " is strictly forbidden under german media laws .
that ’ s also the reason why bibel tv will not be broadcasting any mass or sermons in the country .

critics fear that the new rules would water down the tribunal . an increasingly chilly transatlantic relationship underwent a major thawing on monday as the european union finally reached an agreement with washington over the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , ending weeks of wrangling .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , approved a set of " guidelines " under which member states , if they so wish , can agree not to hand over americans suspected of war crimes to the icc .
per stig moeller , the foreign minister of denmark , which holds the rotating eu presidency , denied that the new rules would water down the international tribunal .
" there is no concession , " he said .
" there is no undermining of the international criminal court . "
icc treaty undermined ?
despite those strong words , all eu states agree in principle that the immunity deals , as sought by the united states , flout the tribunal ’ s founding treaty .
the icc , which is due to start its work in the hague next year , will try individuals for genocide , atrocities , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses .
washington , which fears its soldiers and officials overseas could be vulnerable to politically motivated charges , has strongly opposed the international criminal court .
it has lobbied icc signatories for months to sign " immunity agreements " under which they would agree not to hand any us citizen over to the tribunal .
so far 12 non-eu countries have done so .
germany sticks to its line with the eu ’ s caving in , britain , italy and spain , two of president bush ’ s staunchest allies are expected to begin negotiations with the united states on an agreement not to hand over certain categories of american citizens to face the new court .
however , germany remains the only country to remain openly hostile to the principle of keeping americans out of the court ’ s reach , undaunted by its own recent nose-diving relations with the united states .
germany made it clear that it would definitely not be signing such a deal .
" people are looking to europe , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters .
" what matters is that the europeans stand together on the basis of a strengthening of the court ’ s statute .
what matters to us is not to assuage anyone . "
eu compromise under scathing criticism but the eu ’ s compromise has come under fire from critics who say that the eu move is a climb-down and that the 15-nation-bloc has papered over its own fundamental disagreements on the issue to end a tense stand-off with no guarantee that the united states would agree to its proposals .
in a statement , dick oosting , director of amnesty international ’ s eu office said " us pressure has paid off .
the eu has allowed the us to shift the terms of the debate from legal principle to political opportunism . "

critics fear that the new rules would water down the tribunal . an increasingly chilly transatlantic relationship underwent a major thawing on monday as the european union finally reached an agreement with washington over the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , ending weeks of wrangling .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , approved a set of " guidelines " under which member states , if they so wish , can agree not to hand over americans suspected of war crimes to the icc .
per stig moeller , the foreign minister of denmark , which holds the rotating eu presidency , denied that the new rules would water down the international tribunal .
" there is no concession , " he said .
" there is no undermining of the international criminal court . "
icc treaty undermined ?
despite those strong words , all eu states agree in principle that the immunity deals , as sought by the united states , flout the tribunal ’ s founding treaty .
the icc , which is due to start its work in the hague next year , will try individuals for genocide , atrocities , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses .
washington , which fears its soldiers and officials overseas could be vulnerable to politically motivated charges , has strongly opposed the international criminal court .
it has lobbied icc signatories for months to sign " immunity agreements " under which they would agree not to hand any us citizen over to the tribunal .
so far 12 non-eu countries have done so .
germany sticks to its line with the eu ’ s caving in , britain , italy and spain , two of president bush ’ s staunchest allies are expected to begin negotiations with the united states on an agreement not to hand over certain categories of american citizens to face the new court .
however , germany remains the only country to remain openly hostile to the principle of keeping americans out of the court ’ s reach , undaunted by its own recent nose-diving relations with the united states .
germany made it clear that it would definitely not be signing such a deal .
" people are looking to europe , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters .
" what matters is that the europeans stand together on the basis of a strengthening of the court ’ s statute .
what matters to us is not to assuage anyone . "
eu compromise under scathing criticism but the eu ’ s compromise has come under fire from critics who say that the eu move is a climb-down and that the 15-nation-bloc has papered over its own fundamental disagreements on the issue to end a tense stand-off with no guarantee that the united states would agree to its proposals .
in a statement , dick oosting , director of amnesty international ’ s eu office said " us pressure has paid off .
the eu has allowed the us to shift the terms of the debate from legal principle to political opportunism . "
richard dicker of the new york-based lobby group human rights watch said the eu ’ s compromise " suggests a retreat by the eu from its strong common position for the icc .

and like the previous four years of government , the talks take place amid the sober reality of germany ’ s current economic misery . the two partners are faced with an unemployment rate that is likely to go up , not down , in the coming year , an ever-rising debt and a bloated social welfare system in bad need of reform . their response , at least after the first day of talks , has been to maintain a strict savings course in face of a 10 billion euro budget deficit and begin eliminating state subsidies . ” we will not leave our consolidation course , ” fritz kuhn , chairman of the green party , told reporters . read my lips : no new tax hikes kuhn and his neogtiating partners also ended speculation that the new red-green coalition , named after the colors identified with the two parties , would raise taxes to increase the government 's paltry income . tax money this year is already 3.5 percent less than last year and state spending is putting germany on bad terms with its european union neighbors .
should debt increase , germany will break an eu rule that debt should be no more than 3 percent of annual gross domestic product - a rule the country helped craft . social democratic state premiers had suggested over the weekend hikes in property , inheritance and the tobacco tax were necessary in order to change germany 's miserable economic situation . the suggestion caused an uproar in the opposition parties and among the country 's editorialists alike .
finance experts said taxation would be " poison " for germany 's economic turnaround . chancellor gerhard schröder said monday night that talk of tax hikes was " very annoying " .
he said the coalition negotiations would focus on cutting subsidies and eliminating " excess " tax priveleges and subsidies . labor market reform , but when ? some coalition politicians and financial experts say a little trimming here and there wo n't solve germany 's slow growth and unemployment , which is now hovering between 4.5 and 4.7 million . the country 's over-regulated labor market and massive social security costs have laid a heavy burden on the economic turnaround . schröder used an august report by a commission of experts headed by volkswagen board member peter hartz to soothe voters ' fears in the final weeks leading up to the election . but experts doubt all of the recommendations made by the commission can be applied .
many have been criticized by industry leaders .
should schröder try to implement any of industry 's labor market recommendations he will run into problems with the unions , who helped him keep his job . schröder already made clear that among the subsidies to be cut , the coal industry 's 2.78 billion euro subsidy wo n't be among them . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .

critics fear that the new rules would water down the tribunal . an increasingly chilly transatlantic relationship underwent a major thawing on monday as the european union finally reached an agreement with washington over the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , ending weeks of wrangling .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , approved a set of " guidelines " under which member states , if they so wish , can agree not to hand over americans suspected of war crimes to the icc .
per stig moeller , the foreign minister of denmark , which holds the rotating eu presidency , denied that the new rules would water down the international tribunal .
" there is no concession , " he said .
" there is no undermining of the international criminal court . "
icc treaty undermined ?
despite those strong words , all eu states agree in principle that the immunity deals , as sought by the united states , flout the tribunal ’ s founding treaty .
the icc , which is due to start its work in the hague next year , will try individuals for genocide , atrocities , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses .
washington , which fears its soldiers and officials overseas could be vulnerable to politically motivated charges , has strongly opposed the international criminal court .
it has lobbied icc signatories for months to sign " immunity agreements " under which they would agree not to hand any us citizen over to the tribunal .
so far 12 non-eu countries have done so .
germany sticks to its line with the eu ’ s caving in , britain , italy and spain , two of president bush ’ s staunchest allies are expected to begin negotiations with the united states on an agreement not to hand over certain categories of american citizens to face the new court .
however , germany remains the only country to remain openly hostile to the principle of keeping americans out of the court ’ s reach , undaunted by its own recent nose-diving relations with the united states .
germany made it clear that it would definitely not be signing such a deal .
" people are looking to europe , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters .
" what matters is that the europeans stand together on the basis of a strengthening of the court ’ s statute .
what matters to us is not to assuage anyone . "
eu compromise under scathing criticism but the eu ’ s compromise has come under fire from critics who say that the eu move is a climb-down and that the 15-nation-bloc has papered over its own fundamental disagreements on the issue to end a tense stand-off with no guarantee that the united states would agree to its proposals .
in a statement , dick oosting , director of amnesty international ’ s eu office said " us pressure has paid off .
the eu has allowed the us to shift the terms of the debate from legal principle to political opportunism . "

critics fear that the new rules would water down the tribunal . an increasingly chilly transatlantic relationship underwent a major thawing on monday as the european union finally reached an agreement with washington over the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , ending weeks of wrangling .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , approved a set of " guidelines " under which member states , if they so wish , can agree not to hand over americans suspected of war crimes to the icc .
per stig moeller , the foreign minister of denmark , which holds the rotating eu presidency , denied that the new rules would water down the international tribunal .
" there is no concession , " he said .
" there is no undermining of the international criminal court . "
icc treaty undermined ?
despite those strong words , all eu states agree in principle that the immunity deals , as sought by the united states , flout the tribunal ’ s founding treaty .
the icc , which is due to start its work in the hague next year , will try individuals for genocide , atrocities , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses .
washington , which fears its soldiers and officials overseas could be vulnerable to politically motivated charges , has strongly opposed the international criminal court .
it has lobbied icc signatories for months to sign " immunity agreements " under which they would agree not to hand any us citizen over to the tribunal .
so far 12 non-eu countries have done so .
germany sticks to its line with the eu ’ s caving in , britain , italy and spain , two of president bush ’ s staunchest allies are expected to begin negotiations with the united states on an agreement not to hand over certain categories of american citizens to face the new court .
however , germany remains the only country to remain openly hostile to the principle of keeping americans out of the court ’ s reach , undaunted by its own recent nose-diving relations with the united states .
germany made it clear that it would definitely not be signing such a deal .
" people are looking to europe , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters .
" what matters is that the europeans stand together on the basis of a strengthening of the court ’ s statute .
what matters to us is not to assuage anyone . "
eu compromise under scathing criticism but the eu ’ s compromise has come under fire from critics who say that the eu move is a climb-down and that the 15-nation-bloc has papered over its own fundamental disagreements on the issue to end a tense stand-off with no guarantee that the united states would agree to its proposals .
in a statement , dick oosting , director of amnesty international ’ s eu office said " us pressure has paid off .
the eu has allowed the us to shift the terms of the debate from legal principle to political opportunism . "

it hopes to grab the attention of church-weary germans and capitalise on a reawakened interest in spirituality . young people in germany may be turning their backs on the church , but that hasn ’ t stopped the booming popularity of christian media and especially christian music in the country , whether it ’ s gospel , soul or heavy metal .
theologians are speaking of a new awakened spirituality in germany , a trend towards " moral meaning " in life , need for tranquillity , balance and a new metaphysics of the mystery of life .
it may all sound a bit esoteric , but the team behind germany ’ s first digital niche christian channel is convinced that beaming god 's message directly into living rooms is the formula to success .
under the motto " i believe .
i see " , bibel tv hopes to bring the holy scriptures closer to the people .
interest in things spiritual rekindled " the churches here -lrb- in germany -rrb- have an incredible deficit of young people , " henning röhl , executive director of the non-profit bibel tv foundation ltd and himself a member of the german lutheran church -lrb- ekd -rrb- told the german newspaper , berliner morgenpost .
" at the same time there ’ s a strong religious atmosphere in germany , a newly awakened spirituality that ’ s overwhelming , " he said .
bibel tv now plans to cash in on these church-disillusioned but spiritually-awake young people with a funky programme for the video-clip-dance generation .
a viva-version with a difference " we want to become a christian viva or mtv , " röhl told the german newspaper " die welt " .
indeed , music will take much of the air time on bibel tv .
called " jericho .
music that transforms " , the music programme won ’ t just play spiritual and choral music by bach , but also gospel songs and modern rock such as the us band p.o.d. and pop music with a christian relevance .
younger viewers will be treated to cartoon characters radiantly singing hymns and narrating stories from the bible .
the rest of air time will be taken up by everything from the genesis to apocalypse as prominent actors read from the bible , theologians debate on where christianity is headed , children ’ s programmes , quizzes , documentaries , movies and small quotes from the bible turn up on trailers .
the genesis of bibel tv a phenomenon long common in other european countries and in america , a niche religion channel is a first for germany .
some five christian television channels already exist in great britain and they ’ re popular in holland too .
the idea for germany ’ s first christian channel was born five years ago in a hotel room as the controversial publisher from bonn and self-made millionaire , normann rentrop happened to pick up the bible and began to read it .
since then he hasn ’ t managed to shake off the influence of the book of all books .
" everyday i find answers and comfort to problems " , he was reported as saying .
rentrop since has been seized by the desire to bring the holy scriptures closer to all of germany .
he hit upon the idea of a christian channel as an antidote to other channels that constantly show " murder and mystery films " .
rentrop also believes that television is the ideal medium for god ’ s message .
" we germans spend some 20 percent of our time on an average in front of the television , " he says on the bibel tv website .
rentrop pulled off a coup when he roped in the media-experienced 59-year-old henning röhl , former boss of german public broadcasters ard and mdr , to head the bibel tv team .
finances could cause a headache financing will however remain a big concern for the bibel tv initiative .
though rentrop ’ s own non-profit foundation pumped some 12 million euro into the project , röhl can reckon with just 500,000 to 750,000 euro per year for the channel that will be beamed over the digital astra satellite into an estimated 1,2 to 1,8 million german-speaking households .
rentrop hopes that bibel tv will be able to finance itself in three years through advertising revenues .
his team is open to all kinds of advertising ventures expect those related to telephone sex numbers and the kind .
" the advertising must be complementary to the programme , " he says .
no proselytising the bibel tv team is also clear that its aim is not to proselytise or end up being a missionary television channel .
after all " religious advertising " is strictly forbidden under german media laws .
that ’ s also the reason why bibel tv will not be broadcasting any mass or sermons in the country .

the genesis of bibel tv a phenomenon long common in other european countries and in america , a niche religion channel is a first for germany .
some five christian television channels already exist in great britain and they ’ re popular in holland too .
the idea for germany ’ s first christian channel was born five years ago in a hotel room as the controversial publisher from bonn and self-made millionaire , normann rentrop happened to pick up the bible and began to read it .
since then he hasn ’ t managed to shake off the influence of the book of all books .
" everyday i find answers and comfort to problems " , he was reported as saying .
rentrop since has been seized by the desire to bring the holy scriptures closer to all of germany .
he hit upon the idea of a christian channel as an antidote to other channels that constantly show " murder and mystery films " .
rentrop also believes that television is the ideal medium for god ’ s message .
" we germans spend some 20 percent of our time on an average in front of the television , " he says on the bibel tv website .
rentrop pulled off a coup when he roped in the media-experienced 59-year-old henning röhl , former boss of german public broadcasters ard and mdr , to head the bibel tv team .
finances could cause a headache financing will however remain a big concern for the bibel tv initiative .
though rentrop ’ s own non-profit foundation pumped some 12 million euro into the project , röhl can reckon with just 500,000 to 750,000 euro per year for the channel that will be beamed over the digital astra satellite into an estimated 1,2 to 1,8 million german-speaking households .
rentrop hopes that bibel tv will be able to finance itself in three years through advertising revenues .
his team is open to all kinds of advertising ventures expect those related to telephone sex numbers and the kind .
" the advertising must be complementary to the programme , " he says .
no proselytising the bibel tv team is also clear that its aim is not to proselytise or end up being a missionary television channel .
after all " religious advertising " is strictly forbidden under german media laws .
that ’ s also the reason why bibel tv will not be broadcasting any mass or sermons in the country .

and like the previous four years of government , the talks take place amid the sober reality of germany ’ s current economic misery . the two partners are faced with an unemployment rate that is likely to go up , not down , in the coming year , an ever-rising debt and a bloated social welfare system in bad need of reform . their response , at least after the first day of talks , has been to maintain a strict savings course in face of a 10 billion euro budget deficit and begin eliminating state subsidies . ” we will not leave our consolidation course , ” fritz kuhn , chairman of the green party , told reporters . read my lips : no new tax hikes kuhn and his neogtiating partners also ended speculation that the new red-green coalition , named after the colors identified with the two parties , would raise taxes to increase the government 's paltry income . tax money this year is already 3.5 percent less than last year and state spending is putting germany on bad terms with its european union neighbors .

critics fear that the new rules would water down the tribunal . an increasingly chilly transatlantic relationship underwent a major thawing on monday as the european union finally reached an agreement with washington over the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , ending weeks of wrangling .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , approved a set of " guidelines " under which member states , if they so wish , can agree not to hand over americans suspected of war crimes to the icc .
per stig moeller , the foreign minister of denmark , which holds the rotating eu presidency , denied that the new rules would water down the international tribunal .
" there is no concession , " he said .
" there is no undermining of the international criminal court . "
icc treaty undermined ?
despite those strong words , all eu states agree in principle that the immunity deals , as sought by the united states , flout the tribunal ’ s founding treaty .
the icc , which is due to start its work in the hague next year , will try individuals for genocide , atrocities , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses .
washington , which fears its soldiers and officials overseas could be vulnerable to politically motivated charges , has strongly opposed the international criminal court .
it has lobbied icc signatories for months to sign " immunity agreements " under which they would agree not to hand any us citizen over to the tribunal .
so far 12 non-eu countries have done so .
germany sticks to its line with the eu ’ s caving in , britain , italy and spain , two of president bush ’ s staunchest allies are expected to begin negotiations with the united states on an agreement not to hand over certain categories of american citizens to face the new court .
however , germany remains the only country to remain openly hostile to the principle of keeping americans out of the court ’ s reach , undaunted by its own recent nose-diving relations with the united states .
germany made it clear that it would definitely not be signing such a deal .
" people are looking to europe , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters .
" what matters is that the europeans stand together on the basis of a strengthening of the court ’ s statute .
what matters to us is not to assuage anyone . "
eu compromise under scathing criticism but the eu ’ s compromise has come under fire from critics who say that the eu move is a climb-down and that the 15-nation-bloc has papered over its own fundamental disagreements on the issue to end a tense stand-off with no guarantee that the united states would agree to its proposals .
in a statement , dick oosting , director of amnesty international ’ s eu office said " us pressure has paid off .
the eu has allowed the us to shift the terms of the debate from legal principle to political opportunism . "

critics fear that the new rules would water down the tribunal . an increasingly chilly transatlantic relationship underwent a major thawing on monday as the european union finally reached an agreement with washington over the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , ending weeks of wrangling .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , approved a set of " guidelines " under which member states , if they so wish , can agree not to hand over americans suspected of war crimes to the icc .
per stig moeller , the foreign minister of denmark , which holds the rotating eu presidency , denied that the new rules would water down the international tribunal .
" there is no concession , " he said .
" there is no undermining of the international criminal court . "
icc treaty undermined ?
despite those strong words , all eu states agree in principle that the immunity deals , as sought by the united states , flout the tribunal ’ s founding treaty .
the icc , which is due to start its work in the hague next year , will try individuals for genocide , atrocities , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses .
washington , which fears its soldiers and officials overseas could be vulnerable to politically motivated charges , has strongly opposed the international criminal court .
it has lobbied icc signatories for months to sign " immunity agreements " under which they would agree not to hand any us citizen over to the tribunal .
so far 12 non-eu countries have done so .
germany sticks to its line with the eu ’ s caving in , britain , italy and spain , two of president bush ’ s staunchest allies are expected to begin negotiations with the united states on an agreement not to hand over certain categories of american citizens to face the new court .
however , germany remains the only country to remain openly hostile to the principle of keeping americans out of the court ’ s reach , undaunted by its own recent nose-diving relations with the united states .
germany made it clear that it would definitely not be signing such a deal .
" people are looking to europe , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters .
" what matters is that the europeans stand together on the basis of a strengthening of the court ’ s statute .
what matters to us is not to assuage anyone . "
eu compromise under scathing criticism but the eu ’ s compromise has come under fire from critics who say that the eu move is a climb-down and that the 15-nation-bloc has papered over its own fundamental disagreements on the issue to end a tense stand-off with no guarantee that the united states would agree to its proposals .
in a statement , dick oosting , director of amnesty international ’ s eu office said " us pressure has paid off .
the eu has allowed the us to shift the terms of the debate from legal principle to political opportunism . "
richard dicker of the new york-based lobby group human rights watch said the eu ’ s compromise " suggests a retreat by the eu from its strong common position for the icc .

it hopes to grab the attention of church-weary germans and capitalise on a reawakened interest in spirituality . young people in germany may be turning their backs on the church , but that hasn ’ t stopped the booming popularity of christian media and especially christian music in the country , whether it ’ s gospel , soul or heavy metal .
theologians are speaking of a new awakened spirituality in germany , a trend towards " moral meaning " in life , need for tranquillity , balance and a new metaphysics of the mystery of life .
it may all sound a bit esoteric , but the team behind germany ’ s first digital niche christian channel is convinced that beaming god 's message directly into living rooms is the formula to success .
under the motto " i believe .
i see " , bibel tv hopes to bring the holy scriptures closer to the people .
interest in things spiritual rekindled " the churches here -lrb- in germany -rrb- have an incredible deficit of young people , " henning röhl , executive director of the non-profit bibel tv foundation ltd and himself a member of the german lutheran church -lrb- ekd -rrb- told the german newspaper , berliner morgenpost .
" at the same time there ’ s a strong religious atmosphere in germany , a newly awakened spirituality that ’ s overwhelming , " he said .
bibel tv now plans to cash in on these church-disillusioned but spiritually-awake young people with a funky programme for the video-clip-dance generation .
a viva-version with a difference " we want to become a christian viva or mtv , " röhl told the german newspaper " die welt " .
indeed , music will take much of the air time on bibel tv .
called " jericho .
music that transforms " , the music programme won ’ t just play spiritual and choral music by bach , but also gospel songs and modern rock such as the us band p.o.d. and pop music with a christian relevance .
younger viewers will be treated to cartoon characters radiantly singing hymns and narrating stories from the bible .
the rest of air time will be taken up by everything from the genesis to apocalypse as prominent actors read from the bible , theologians debate on where christianity is headed , children ’ s programmes , quizzes , documentaries , movies and small quotes from the bible turn up on trailers .
the genesis of bibel tv a phenomenon long common in other european countries and in america , a niche religion channel is a first for germany .
some five christian television channels already exist in great britain and they ’ re popular in holland too .
the idea for germany ’ s first christian channel was born five years ago in a hotel room as the controversial publisher from bonn and self-made millionaire , normann rentrop happened to pick up the bible and began to read it .
since then he hasn ’ t managed to shake off the influence of the book of all books .
" everyday i find answers and comfort to problems " , he was reported as saying .
rentrop since has been seized by the desire to bring the holy scriptures closer to all of germany .
he hit upon the idea of a christian channel as an antidote to other channels that constantly show " murder and mystery films " .
rentrop also believes that television is the ideal medium for god ’ s message .
" we germans spend some 20 percent of our time on an average in front of the television , " he says on the bibel tv website .
rentrop pulled off a coup when he roped in the media-experienced 59-year-old henning röhl , former boss of german public broadcasters ard and mdr , to head the bibel tv team .
finances could cause a headache financing will however remain a big concern for the bibel tv initiative .
though rentrop ’ s own non-profit foundation pumped some 12 million euro into the project , röhl can reckon with just 500,000 to 750,000 euro per year for the channel that will be beamed over the digital astra satellite into an estimated 1,2 to 1,8 million german-speaking households .
rentrop hopes that bibel tv will be able to finance itself in three years through advertising revenues .
his team is open to all kinds of advertising ventures expect those related to telephone sex numbers and the kind .
" the advertising must be complementary to the programme , " he says .
no proselytising the bibel tv team is also clear that its aim is not to proselytise or end up being a missionary television channel .
after all " religious advertising " is strictly forbidden under german media laws .
that ’ s also the reason why bibel tv will not be broadcasting any mass or sermons in the country .

it hopes to grab the attention of church-weary germans and capitalise on a reawakened interest in spirituality . young people in germany may be turning their backs on the church , but that hasn ’ t stopped the booming popularity of christian media and especially christian music in the country , whether it ’ s gospel , soul or heavy metal .
theologians are speaking of a new awakened spirituality in germany , a trend towards " moral meaning " in life , need for tranquillity , balance and a new metaphysics of the mystery of life .
it may all sound a bit esoteric , but the team behind germany ’ s first digital niche christian channel is convinced that beaming god 's message directly into living rooms is the formula to success .
under the motto " i believe .
i see " , bibel tv hopes to bring the holy scriptures closer to the people .
interest in things spiritual rekindled " the churches here -lrb- in germany -rrb- have an incredible deficit of young people , " henning röhl , executive director of the non-profit bibel tv foundation ltd and himself a member of the german lutheran church -lrb- ekd -rrb- told the german newspaper , berliner morgenpost .
" at the same time there ’ s a strong religious atmosphere in germany , a newly awakened spirituality that ’ s overwhelming , " he said .
bibel tv now plans to cash in on these church-disillusioned but spiritually-awake young people with a funky programme for the video-clip-dance generation .
a viva-version with a difference " we want to become a christian viva or mtv , " röhl told the german newspaper " die welt " .

called " jericho .
music that transforms " , the music programme won ’ t just play spiritual and choral music by bach , but also gospel songs and modern rock such as the us band p.o.d. and pop music with a christian relevance .
younger viewers will be treated to cartoon characters radiantly singing hymns and narrating stories from the bible .
the rest of air time will be taken up by everything from the genesis to apocalypse as prominent actors read from the bible , theologians debate on where christianity is headed , children ’ s programmes , quizzes , documentaries , movies and small quotes from the bible turn up on trailers .
the genesis of bibel tv a phenomenon long common in other european countries and in america , a niche religion channel is a first for germany .
some five christian television channels already exist in great britain and they ’ re popular in holland too .
the idea for germany ’ s first christian channel was born five years ago in a hotel room as the controversial publisher from bonn and self-made millionaire , normann rentrop happened to pick up the bible and began to read it .
since then he hasn ’ t managed to shake off the influence of the book of all books .
" everyday i find answers and comfort to problems " , he was reported as saying .
rentrop since has been seized by the desire to bring the holy scriptures closer to all of germany .
he hit upon the idea of a christian channel as an antidote to other channels that constantly show " murder and mystery films " .
rentrop also believes that television is the ideal medium for god ’ s message .
" we germans spend some 20 percent of our time on an average in front of the television , " he says on the bibel tv website .
rentrop pulled off a coup when he roped in the media-experienced 59-year-old henning röhl , former boss of german public broadcasters ard and mdr , to head the bibel tv team .
finances could cause a headache financing will however remain a big concern for the bibel tv initiative .
though rentrop ’ s own non-profit foundation pumped some 12 million euro into the project , röhl can reckon with just 500,000 to 750,000 euro per year for the channel that will be beamed over the digital astra satellite into an estimated 1,2 to 1,8 million german-speaking households .
rentrop hopes that bibel tv will be able to finance itself in three years through advertising revenues .
his team is open to all kinds of advertising ventures expect those related to telephone sex numbers and the kind .
" the advertising must be complementary to the programme , " he says .
no proselytising the bibel tv team is also clear that its aim is not to proselytise or end up being a missionary television channel .
after all " religious advertising " is strictly forbidden under german media laws .
that ’ s also the reason why bibel tv will not be broadcasting any mass or sermons in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.10.2002 eu climbs down on international criminal court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a subject of transatlantic tension - the international criminal court the european union has agreed on guidelines for bilateral agreements that exempt us troops from prosecution before the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- .
critics fear that the new rules would water down the tribunal . an increasingly chilly transatlantic relationship underwent a major thawing on monday as the european union finally reached an agreement with washington over the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , ending weeks of wrangling .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , approved a set of " guidelines " under which member states , if they so wish , can agree not to hand over americans suspected of war crimes to the icc .
per stig moeller , the foreign minister of denmark , which holds the rotating eu presidency , denied that the new rules would water down the international tribunal .
" there is no concession , " he said .
" there is no undermining of the international criminal court . "
icc treaty undermined ?
despite those strong words , all eu states agree in principle that the immunity deals , as sought by the united states , flout the tribunal ’ s founding treaty .
the icc , which is due to start its work in the hague next year , will try individuals for genocide , atrocities , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses .
washington , which fears its soldiers and officials overseas could be vulnerable to politically motivated charges , has strongly opposed the international criminal court .
it has lobbied icc signatories for months to sign " immunity agreements " under which they would agree not to hand any us citizen over to the tribunal .
so far 12 non-eu countries have done so .
germany sticks to its line with the eu ’ s caving in , britain , italy and spain , two of president bush ’ s staunchest allies are expected to begin negotiations with the united states on an agreement not to hand over certain categories of american citizens to face the new court .
however , germany remains the only country to remain openly hostile to the principle of keeping americans out of the court ’ s reach , undaunted by its own recent nose-diving relations with the united states .
germany made it clear that it would definitely not be signing such a deal .
" people are looking to europe , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters .
" what matters is that the europeans stand together on the basis of a strengthening of the court ’ s statute .
what matters to us is not to assuage anyone . "
eu compromise under scathing criticism but the eu ’ s compromise has come under fire from critics who say that the eu move is a climb-down and that the 15-nation-bloc has papered over its own fundamental disagreements on the issue to end a tense stand-off with no guarantee that the united states would agree to its proposals .
in a statement , dick oosting , director of amnesty international ’ s eu office said " us pressure has paid off .
the eu has allowed the us to shift the terms of the debate from legal principle to political opportunism . "
richard dicker of the new york-based lobby group human rights watch said the eu ’ s compromise " suggests a retreat by the eu from its strong common position for the icc .

should debt increase , germany will break an eu rule that debt should be no more than 3 percent of annual gross domestic product - a rule the country helped craft . social democratic state premiers had suggested over the weekend hikes in property , inheritance and the tobacco tax were necessary in order to change germany 's miserable economic situation . the suggestion caused an uproar in the opposition parties and among the country 's editorialists alike .
finance experts said taxation would be " poison " for germany 's economic turnaround . chancellor gerhard schröder said monday night that talk of tax hikes was " very annoying " .
he said the coalition negotiations would focus on cutting subsidies and eliminating " excess " tax priveleges and subsidies . labor market reform , but when ? some coalition politicians and financial experts say a little trimming here and there wo n't solve germany 's slow growth and unemployment , which is now hovering between 4.5 and 4.7 million . the country 's over-regulated labor market and massive social security costs have laid a heavy burden on the economic turnaround . schröder used an august report by a commission of experts headed by volkswagen board member peter hartz to soothe voters ' fears in the final weeks leading up to the election . but experts doubt all of the recommendations made by the commission can be applied .
many have been criticized by industry leaders .
should schröder try to implement any of industry 's labor market recommendations he will run into problems with the unions , who helped him keep his job . schröder already made clear that among the subsidies to be cut , the coal industry 's 2.78 billion euro subsidy wo n't be among them . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .
they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy .

critics fear that the new rules would water down the tribunal . an increasingly chilly transatlantic relationship underwent a major thawing on monday as the european union finally reached an agreement with washington over the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- , ending weeks of wrangling .
eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , approved a set of " guidelines " under which member states , if they so wish , can agree not to hand over americans suspected of war crimes to the icc .
per stig moeller , the foreign minister of denmark , which holds the rotating eu presidency , denied that the new rules would water down the international tribunal .
" there is no concession , " he said .
" there is no undermining of the international criminal court . "
icc treaty undermined ?
despite those strong words , all eu states agree in principle that the immunity deals , as sought by the united states , flout the tribunal ’ s founding treaty .
the icc , which is due to start its work in the hague next year , will try individuals for genocide , atrocities , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses .
washington , which fears its soldiers and officials overseas could be vulnerable to politically motivated charges , has strongly opposed the international criminal court .
it has lobbied icc signatories for months to sign " immunity agreements " under which they would agree not to hand any us citizen over to the tribunal .
so far 12 non-eu countries have done so .
germany sticks to its line with the eu ’ s caving in , britain , italy and spain , two of president bush ’ s staunchest allies are expected to begin negotiations with the united states on an agreement not to hand over certain categories of american citizens to face the new court .
however , germany remains the only country to remain openly hostile to the principle of keeping americans out of the court ’ s reach , undaunted by its own recent nose-diving relations with the united states .
germany made it clear that it would definitely not be signing such a deal .
" people are looking to europe , " german foreign minister joschka fischer told reporters .
" what matters is that the europeans stand together on the basis of a strengthening of the court ’ s statute .
what matters to us is not to assuage anyone . "
eu compromise under scathing criticism but the eu ’ s compromise has come under fire from critics who say that the eu move is a climb-down and that the 15-nation-bloc has papered over its own fundamental disagreements on the issue to end a tense stand-off with no guarantee that the united states would agree to its proposals .
in a statement , dick oosting , director of amnesty international ’ s eu office said " us pressure has paid off .
the eu has allowed the us to shift the terms of the debate from legal principle to political opportunism . "
richard dicker of the new york-based lobby group human rights watch said the eu ’ s compromise " suggests a retreat by the eu from its strong common position for the icc .

it hopes to grab the attention of church-weary germans and capitalise on a reawakened interest in spirituality . young people in germany may be turning their backs on the church , but that hasn ’ t stopped the booming popularity of christian media and especially christian music in the country , whether it ’ s gospel , soul or heavy metal .
theologians are speaking of a new awakened spirituality in germany , a trend towards " moral meaning " in life , need for tranquillity , balance and a new metaphysics of the mystery of life .
it may all sound a bit esoteric , but the team behind germany ’ s first digital niche christian channel is convinced that beaming god 's message directly into living rooms is the formula to success .
under the motto " i believe .
i see " , bibel tv hopes to bring the holy scriptures closer to the people .
interest in things spiritual rekindled " the churches here -lrb- in germany -rrb- have an incredible deficit of young people , " henning röhl , executive director of the non-profit bibel tv foundation ltd and himself a member of the german lutheran church -lrb- ekd -rrb- told the german newspaper , berliner morgenpost .
" at the same time there ’ s a strong religious atmosphere in germany , a newly awakened spirituality that ’ s overwhelming , " he said .
bibel tv now plans to cash in on these church-disillusioned but spiritually-awake young people with a funky programme for the video-clip-dance generation .
a viva-version with a difference " we want to become a christian viva or mtv , " röhl told the german newspaper " die welt " .
indeed , music will take much of the air time on bibel tv .
called " jericho .
music that transforms " , the music programme won ’ t just play spiritual and choral music by bach , but also gospel songs and modern rock such as the us band p.o.d. and pop music with a christian relevance .
younger viewers will be treated to cartoon characters radiantly singing hymns and narrating stories from the bible .
the rest of air time will be taken up by everything from the genesis to apocalypse as prominent actors read from the bible , theologians debate on where christianity is headed , children ’ s programmes , quizzes , documentaries , movies and small quotes from the bible turn up on trailers .
the genesis of bibel tv a phenomenon long common in other european countries and in america , a niche religion channel is a first for germany .
some five christian television channels already exist in great britain and they ’ re popular in holland too .
the idea for germany ’ s first christian channel was born five years ago in a hotel room as the controversial publisher from bonn and self-made millionaire , normann rentrop happened to pick up the bible and began to read it .
since then he hasn ’ t managed to shake off the influence of the book of all books .
" everyday i find answers and comfort to problems " , he was reported as saying .
rentrop since has been seized by the desire to bring the holy scriptures closer to all of germany .
he hit upon the idea of a christian channel as an antidote to other channels that constantly show " murder and mystery films " .
rentrop also believes that television is the ideal medium for god ’ s message .
" we germans spend some 20 percent of our time on an average in front of the television , " he says on the bibel tv website .
rentrop pulled off a coup when he roped in the media-experienced 59-year-old henning röhl , former boss of german public broadcasters ard and mdr , to head the bibel tv team .
finances could cause a headache financing will however remain a big concern for the bibel tv initiative .
though rentrop ’ s own non-profit foundation pumped some 12 million euro into the project , röhl can reckon with just 500,000 to 750,000 euro per year for the channel that will be beamed over the digital astra satellite into an estimated 1,2 to 1,8 million german-speaking households .
rentrop hopes that bibel tv will be able to finance itself in three years through advertising revenues .
his team is open to all kinds of advertising ventures expect those related to telephone sex numbers and the kind .
" the advertising must be complementary to the programme , " he says .
no proselytising the bibel tv team is also clear that its aim is not to proselytise or end up being a missionary television channel .
after all " religious advertising " is strictly forbidden under german media laws .
that ’ s also the reason why bibel tv will not be broadcasting any mass or sermons in the country .

and like the previous four years of government , the talks take place amid the sober reality of germany ’ s current economic misery . the two partners are faced with an unemployment rate that is likely to go up , not down , in the coming year , an ever-rising debt and a bloated social welfare system in bad need of reform . their response , at least after the first day of talks , has been to maintain a strict savings course in face of a 10 billion euro budget deficit and begin eliminating state subsidies . ” we will not leave our consolidation course , ” fritz kuhn , chairman of the green party , told reporters . read my lips : no new tax hikes kuhn and his neogtiating partners also ended speculation that the new red-green coalition , named after the colors identified with the two parties , would raise taxes to increase the government 's paltry income . tax money this year is already 3.5 percent less than last year and state spending is putting germany on bad terms with its european union neighbors .
should debt increase , germany will break an eu rule that debt should be no more than 3 percent of annual gross domestic product - a rule the country helped craft . social democratic state premiers had suggested over the weekend hikes in property , inheritance and the tobacco tax were necessary in order to change germany 's miserable economic situation . the suggestion caused an uproar in the opposition parties and among the country 's editorialists alike .
finance experts said taxation would be " poison " for germany 's economic turnaround . chancellor gerhard schröder said monday night that talk of tax hikes was " very annoying " .
he said the coalition negotiations would focus on cutting subsidies and eliminating " excess " tax priveleges and subsidies . labor market reform , but when ? some coalition politicians and financial experts say a little trimming here and there wo n't solve germany 's slow growth and unemployment , which is now hovering between 4.5 and 4.7 million . the country 's over-regulated labor market and massive social security costs have laid a heavy burden on the economic turnaround . schröder used an august report by a commission of experts headed by volkswagen board member peter hartz to soothe voters ' fears in the final weeks leading up to the election . but experts doubt all of the recommendations made by the commission can be applied .
many have been criticized by industry leaders .
should schröder try to implement any of industry 's labor market recommendations he will run into problems with the unions , who helped him keep his job . schröder already made clear that among the subsidies to be cut , the coal industry 's 2.78 billion euro subsidy wo n't be among them . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .
they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy .

the congress of south african trades unions , cosatu , is allied to the ruling african national congress but objects strongly to the privatisation of state owned enterprises .
the strike is the latest open example of conflict over policy between the government of president thabo mbeki and some of its closest supporters .
many in south africa now ask how long the alliance , which includes the south african communist party , can last .
ignoring the poor the african national congress wears its credentials as a liberation movement with great pride .
nothing is more insulting to it than to suggest that it is somehow less than caring about the poorest in south african society .
this is why it has reacted so sharply against the two day general strike - warning against what is termed " ultra-leftist " principles .
in reality the urban working class has been moving away from the anc for some time .
the privatisation of electricity or telecommunications may please foreign investors , but it has cost ordinary workers many thousands of jobs .
the trades unions , who are in a political alliance with the anc , could not ignore this challenge to their interests .
numerous meetings have failed to bridge the gap .
and now , in conjunction with the south african communist party , they are taking their protests to the streets .
political commentators now suggest that the alliance with the anc may be at breaking point .
some even talk of the founding of a separate party of labour .
but so far union leaders have resisted a final separation , and have managed the anger of their supporters , rather than challenging the government 's right to rule .

but the latest research appears to contradict other recent findings .
in april , the university of glamorgan 's business school warned wales was lagging 30 % behind the uk in the rate at which entrepreneurs create start-up companies .
only half of welsh firms export their goods and just 9 % use e-commerce to rack up global sales - characteristics of fast-growing businesses .
in july , the global entrepreneurship monitor report found 3.7 % more of the welsh population had become entrepreneurs in the last two years .
that meant 6 % of people are starting their own business or already running their own firm - more than only scotland .
just 11 % of welsh people believe there are good opportunities to start a business in the next six months .
that is something one of many welsh developmetn agency plans - becauseyoucan.com - is looking to improve upon .

the national birth and motherhood survey commissioned by mother and baby magazine questioned new mothers in every region in the uk about their experiences of giving birth .
in northern ireland , 75 % of the women surveyed - the largest number in any region in the uk - said they were frightened during labour because they were not told what was happening .
that was compared to the uk average of 45 % .
and 37 % of women said they found their hospital maternity staff cold and lacking in compassion .
their men were not much help either - 37 % of partners present at the birth said they felt queasy and needed to leave the room for fresh air , and 4 % actually passing out .
however , there were a higher number of women compared to the uk average who said their partner 's behaviour towards them improved when they were pregnant .
unplanned pregnancies the survey said almost half of all pregnancies in northern ireland were unplanned , 46 % compared to the uk average of 32 % , and women in northern ireland also conceived more quickly - in an average of six months , compared to the uk average of nine months .
women in northern ireland were the least likely to want to know the sex of their baby in advance - only 35 % compared to the uk average of 45 % - because they preferred a surprise .
three quarters of mothers in northern ireland said they did not feel comfortable breast feeding in public , which was slightly higher than the uk average of 65 % .
meanwhile , almost half of new mothers in northern ireland said it was not financially worth their while returning to work due to child minding costs -lrb- 46 % -rrb- , compared to the uk average -lrb- 36 % -rrb- .
' birth lottery ' nationally , the report authors said that eight out of 10 women said they were frightened during labour and birth .
three quarters said it was more painful than they ever imagined and 53 % found it " far more shocking than they thought " .
more than half - 57 % - found antenatal classes had not told them the truth .
after the birth , 86 % said they were in pain for an average of 24 days and a third said they were " in considerable pain " .
dani zur , editor of mother and baby , said it showed that giving birth in britain today has become a " lottery " .
she said if a woman went into labour on a day when the maternity unit was fully staffed she was likely to have a good experience , but if the unit was understaffed and under-resourced she was not so lucky .
" the result is that many women who give birth in britain today feel shocked and depressed by their experience , " she said .

"
the best chance we have of resolving this crisis peacefully is by the toughest possible stand " jack straw delegates at blackpool rejected a motion opposing any form of military action by 59.8 % to 40.2 % - revealing the depth of labour divisions on the issue .
a second motion backing the government position - that military action must comply with international law and be used as a last resort - was agreed on a show of hands .
the heated debate saw ministers comparing failure to tackle iraq with appeasing hitler in the 1930s as anti-war campaigners accused america of wanting a war for oil .
key paradox mr straw invoked the example his labour predecessor ernie bevin , who called for the international community to use more than words against fascist germany in the 1930s .
mr straw said : " there 's a paradox here we all have to face .
" it is the crux of the matter .
the best chance we have of resolving this crisis peacefully is by the toughest possible stand which makes clear our readiness to use force if the international will continues to be defied . "
as talks continue on agreeing a new united nations resolution on iraq , mr straw was especially keen to emphasise the threat posed by failing to confront saddam hussein .
letting " this tyrannical dictator off the hook " risked fundamentally undermining the un , he argued .
mr straw stressed ministers all shared concern about the possibility of military action - and hoped it would come to that .
defence secretary geoff hoon drew comparisons with adolf hitler and afghanistan as he addressed the iraq crisis .
' nightmare ' mr hoon argued the uk was being patient in its approach , as it had been after the 11 september attacks , and he said the international community would give iraq an ultimatum .
mr hoon added : " imagine a nightmare world in which the terrorists who caused such horror last year , or tyrants like saddam hussein , were free to act with impunity .
" those who doubt whether we were right need to reflect on that nightmare " . "
this will be the first war about oil " alice mahon anti-war mp but labour delegates lined up to criticise the government 's position on iraq .
halifax mp alice mahon said us president george bush was intent on going to war .
" i think it 's a disgrace that our government appears to be the only one in the western world that appears ready to back him , " said ms mahon .
' shameful ' stance the mp said if there was a war it would not be about weapons of mass destruction .
" it will be the first war about oil , " she said to cheers from delegates .
eileen sinclair , of cunninghame south , said she was " ashamed " of labour 's foreign policy .
" the iraqi people themselves with the pressure of the world behind them must depose saddam hussein - not us with bombs , " she said .
but brian seymour-smith , of birmingham northfield , said the government 's stance should be backed and that labour needed to show itself as " a party of realism and courage " .
" sanctions are clearly not working and containment is being flouted .
it is time to act through the un , " said mr seymour-smith .
aid promise earlier , international development secretary clare short said the uk must " redouble efforts " to ensure iraq follows un resolutions .
ms short , who is said to be sceptical about military action against iraq , said no one should welcome " drumbeat of war " .
she continued : " we must therefore redouble our efforts to ensure that iraq abides by un resolutions and that this time its weapons of mass destruction are destroyed and removed . "
she said that if iraq met un demands and sanctions were lifted , the uk was ready to mount a " strong and immediate " effort to aid iraq .
like other ministers , ms short also stressed the importance of renewing efforts to achieve peace in the middle east .

beats the rubbish they are pouring out now .
today 's music is either a dirge , monotic drivel or throwaway noise !
brian myrie , uk as far as i know the compliation does not include my favourite song , guitar man .
may not have been a number one but i do n't think any " best of elvis " compilation is complete without it .
nik , england just bought the set and wow , the sound is incredible , compared it to numerous greatest hits releases from the past decade and this is a modern cd for modern ears - it 's the re-birth of the greatest song stylist in popular culture .
it just shows what any " pop idol " has to inspire too ! !
phil shakespeare , england -lrb- birmingham -rrb- " i loved every running minute of it " aaron woods , usa fantastic overview of a career that has spawned three decades and , two and a half decades after , still haunts us .
wooden heart is the odd one out , but on the whole , this latest bmg extravaganza should confirm , to both the fan and the undiscriminating , that there was no other singer with such an unerring ear .
guillermo perez -arguello , nicaragua this cd , like every other from " the king " , was a complete hit .
i loved every running minute of it .
aaron nathaniel woods , united states of america i 'm just amazed how elvis has managed to have 30 number one songs without people including the charts themselves , knowing he 's managed so many , so like everything to do with him it 's often hard to tell where the pr legend finishes and the music begins .
nonetheless suspicious minds and in the ghetto are still superb today .
james newman , england being a mixing engineer myself this release is overpromoted and heavily disappointing .
it is too clean , it lacks the warmth of elvis 's voice .
joe t. , usa the sound on this cd is superb !
for years these compilations have been put together with varying degrees of sound quality that did not showcase elvis talent the way he deserved .
this release clearly shows what can be achieved .
this will sell well and justifiably so !
derek gillies , uk " the tracks have been completely re-mastered giving an awesome sound " brian quinn , england i think that elvis 's 30 no.1 hits cd is the greatest album of all time .
why ?
it is the testimony to the greatest singer / entertainer of the 20th century .
the tracks have been completely re-mastered giving an awesome sound .
elvis was unique and forever remains the king .
brian quinn , england elvis changed the progression of worldwide music , and also much forgotten today , bridged the gap between the black and white race through his unique style of both singing and attitude .
this compilation not only illustrates the great raw elvis presley - it reminds us of how one man changed the world forever .
arun bagga , england boy oh boy , i had nearly forgotten how good the man was .
this cd proves again what we already knew .
he is still the king .
on most of the tracks the sound is excellent , with the climax being burning love .
frank rakke , the netherlands the 30 uk / usa no. 1s included on this new cd do not represent elvis at his best -lrb- hes had over 100 chart entries so this is n't even a third of his singles -rrb- .
the beatles 1s effort from two years ago , was more / less a complete assessment of their singles as all -lrb- bar love me do , please please me , strawberry fields forever and magical mystrey tour -rrb- reached no. 1 in either the uk / usa charts , helping its high sales .
i do n't think the elvis effort will be half as successful -lrb- his 50 greatest hits from three years ago was a better introduction to his singles -rrb- .
paul , uk absolutely brilliant , it 's been 25 years and we are still waiting for someone better .
there wo n't be .
this is the best there ever will be so enjoy it !
gary shepherd , uk " the cd aptly shows , through the variety of material and quality of performances , why elvis ¿ memory endures 25 years after his death " tony philcox , uk what a fantastic cd ! !
burning love has been brilliantly remixed .
this cd just shows elvis could master any kind of music from gospel to rock .
is elvis still the king ?
damn right he is !
nick , uk finding suitable words to describe the man and his music is almost impossible .
in the words of the record company - before anyone did anything , elvis did everything .
lesley fewell , uk the cd aptly shows , through the variety of material and quality of performances , why elvis ¿ memory endures 25 years after his death and why new fans are appearing all the time .
many non-fans have misconceptions about how elvis really sounded and performed - assuming that , like most second-rate impersonators , he simply mumbled and uttered a few well placed " uh huh huhs . "
this album reveals that to be far from the case .
to recognise the versatility of elvis presley , one only has to compare the rasping vocals of jailhouse rock with the superbly controlled and perfectly in tune ballad singing on are you lonesome tonight .
it could almost be two different singers , but elvis seems equally at home with both genres .
sure , there are many tracks not on the album that would outshine certain inclusions , but it was right to work on the number one theme - for marketing purposes if nothing else .
may this number one collection hit the number one spot as it rightly deserves .
to have a number one single and number one album in the silver anniversary year of the man 's death would be a superb achievement and could provide a springboard for a newfound respect for the music and the man from the public at large .
tony philcox , england a superb collection that fully justifies the hype .
the vastly improved sound makes the cd a must for existing fans and as a one cd body of work , it 's a great introduction to new fans of the king .
ken guy , england to all those whingers who say that the album does n't represent his entire career , rca did actually release " the all time greatest hits " in 1987 , a double album with over 40 tracks .
this album is merely his number 1s , as the title would seem to suggest !
tim baker , wales anyone who wants to hear how suspicious minds should be performed should listen to this album , once elvis sang a song any cover version simply paled to insignificance .
-lrb- eat your heart out gareth gates -rrb- .
minger , uk , wales .
this is an exceptional cd .
while you could never get all of elvis 's best songs onto one album , every one of these is a classic .
nobody could sing like elvis .
the sound is much improved over previous albums , so if you have 50 greatest hits or 50 greatest love songs or any of the 30 or so hits albums , you still will want this one .
it will be the best selling album this year , in fact it will be the best selling of this millenium so far .
joe , ireland the sound improvement makes it a worthwhile purchase .
elvis being elvis it is quite a classic .
sure some songs are n't there but there is almost 80 minutes of music and that recent radio hit too !
benoit arsenault , canada i 've been an elvis fan for a long time , the clarity , the awesome sound is breathtakingly crisp on the 30 no.1 's cd .
pure magic .
he will always be the king , no matter what people say .
