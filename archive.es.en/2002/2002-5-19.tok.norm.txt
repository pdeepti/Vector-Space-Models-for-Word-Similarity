the 14 hit the headlines in january when they escaped from the novo ulyanovsk camp by digging a long tunnel under the compound fence .
the incident caused a furore not only because the fugitives were serving long sentences for serious crimes , including murder and robbery .
they were all also reported to be infected with hiv .
aids and hiv rates are high in russia 's overcrowded penal system , and the number of registered cases of infection in russia as a whole has shot up in recent years .
according to official statistics , about 200,000 people are hiv-positive , 88,000 of whom were registered this year .
the prisoners had been living in a hut on the edge of the camp reserved for inmates infected with hiv and tb and had taken advantage of their isolation to dig the tunnel using aluminium spoons and makeshift tools .
they were all recaptured within days of their bid for freedom after an unprecedented man-hunt involving 1,000 law enforcement personnel , but during that time the media were filled with reports about the danger their hiv status posed to society .
now the convicts are suing .
a series of hearings has begun at the ulyanovsk court , with the prisoners hoping to receive 200,000 roubles -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- in compensation from journalists for the breach of medical secrecy , russian ntv reported .
one defendant , sergei sharapov , was suffering from tb not hiv and wanted " justice to be restored " , the television said .
the lawyer for another said his client had suffered a nervous breakdown and stopped receiving letters from his girlfriend and relatives as a result of the publicity .
but the judge ruled against sharapov on the day ntv was in court .
and legal specialists believe the chances of the verdicts going the prisoners ' way in the cases still to be heard are " virtually nil " .
the feeling is that dangerous recidivists infected with hiv are outside the law , so " there 's no need to give excessive consideration to such trivial matters as the observation of medical confidentiality " , the report concluded .

an episode of the bbc two series hooligans broadcast on sunday night accuses the lebanese businessman of actively befriending known troublemakers .
the programme shows hammam celebrating cardiff 's promotion to the second division with a group of fans , including members of the notorious soul crew gang .
but he has defended his actions , claiming it was necessary to understand hooligans in order to reform them .
the programme - kicking off - describes how the former owner of wimbledon fc was treated as a messiah when he bought cardiff city in the summer of 2000 .
triumphs and trouble the club was languishing in the third division but , two seasons later , have only narrowly missed promotion to the first .
however , as cardiff city 's fortunes on the field improved , its hooligan reputation got worse .
at the end of hammam 's first season at the club , the bluebirds were promoted to the second division .
the programme shows how known hooligans were among the selected fans treated by the chairman to a coach trip and champagne reception at a hotel outside mansfield , nottinghamshire .
following the event , hammam told a local newspaper that he was " proud to travel with the soul crew " .
in his defence , hammam has claimed to have a policy of rehabilitation of hooligans , saying can tame them with " love and hugs " .
but former police chief superintendent gerry toms , who was head of the cardiff division of south wales police , told the programme he was sceptical of such an approach .
he said : " to bring people who have clearly been involved ... directly and indirectly , in football hooliganism into the heart of the football club is really , in my view , almost endorsing their behaviour . "
national disgrace cardiff 's hooligan problem came to a head in january when the club 's shock fa cup victory against leeds united at ninian park was marred by violence .
among the troublemakers was former bluebirds player dai thomas , who was jailed for 60 days .
the disturbances prompted hammam to launch what he called a " war on hooliganism " .
but further trouble followed an end-of-season playoff against stoke city and the faw premier cup final with swansea city .
on thursday , cardiff was fined £ 20,000 by the football association of wales for misconduct over the trouble at the leeds game .
the next day it was revealed that cardiff were top of the list of clubs whose followers were among more than 1,000 suspected hooligans banned from travelling abroad during the world cup .

we expect a resolution of this issue in the coming days cyprus foreign minister ioannis cassoulides for the last nine days the men have been waiting in a beach hotel in the cypriot town of larnaca .
spanish state radio had earlier reported that an agreement had been brokered to send the men to seven european states , including cyprus - which is not in the european union .
but cypriot foreign minister ioannis cassoulides said no final deal had yet been struck .
temporary guests mr cassoulides expressed optimism about continuing talks about the fate of the palestinians .
" things are moving very well and we expect a resolution of this issue in the coming days , " he told reuters news agency .
cassoulides : no deal yet however , he categorically denied that his country would be offering a permanent refuge to any of the militants .
mr cassoulides said that under the current plan , spain and italy were each expected to take three of the men ; greece and ireland to accommodate four between them , and portugal and belgium would each accept one .
the cypriot foreign minister said that finland late in the day had offered to take the remaining palestinian , but that final arrangements were still being discussed .
cyprus accepted the militants as part of a deal to end the siege at the church of the nativity in bethlehem .
but it has said all along that it was a temporary measure until the eu had decided where their ultimate destinations would be .
it is not known when they will be moved to their host countries .

the eu helped broker the agreement that ended the bethlehem standoff the eu offered to take the militants into exile to end the standoff between the israeli army and the palestinians at the church on 10 may .
the deal was supported by the united states and the vatican .
eu foreign ministers have decided that none of the 13 should face arrest , and they have received assurances from israeli foreign minister shimon peres that israel will not seek their extradition .
the men will also be entitled to reunification with their families at a later date .
the resolution of the bethlehem siege has been seen as a diplomatic coup for the eu , whose interventions in the middle east have tended to be overshadowed by the united states .
" without the european union , the church of the nativity would still be under siege today and israeli troops would still be on the streets of bethlehem , " said spanish foreign minister josep pique .

their prototype , called anthropos , is designed to overcome the barriers between robots and humans .
" it has two cameras for eyes , a speaker as a mouth and there are motors that control how it moves , " explained brian duffy of medialab europe in dublin .
" it can perform gestures , move around and talk to you .
it can understand what you say , " he told the bbc programme , go digital .
becoming human the aim of the project is to use artificial intelligence to create a robot that is friendly and sociable , so that people forget they are talking to a machine .
brian duffy : trying to make robots more human " we are looking at how people interact with this robot , " said dr duffy .
" they have a conversation with the robot and say ' yes ' or ' no ' to questions . "
his team have found that people will often start reacting to the robot , giving it almost human qualities .
" that can give us an indication of what mechanisms the robot can itself use to break down that barrier between people and robots , " he said .
blue or red hair ?
a short chat with anthropos suggested the researchers still have some way to go to make the robot convincing .
" i 'm trying to get more people to believe in me , " it said in a halting , robotic voice .
" i am thinking of getting some glasses .

their prototype , called anthropos , is designed to overcome the barriers between robots and humans .
" it has two cameras for eyes , a speaker as a mouth and there are motors that control how it moves , " explained brian duffy of medialab europe in dublin .
" it can perform gestures , move around and talk to you .
it can understand what you say , " he told the bbc programme , go digital .
becoming human the aim of the project is to use artificial intelligence to create a robot that is friendly and sociable , so that people forget they are talking to a machine .
" we are looking at how people interact with this robot , " said dr duffy .
" they have a conversation with the robot and say ' yes ' or ' no ' to questions . "
his team have found that people will often start reacting to the robot , giving it almost human qualities .
" that can give us an indication of what mechanisms the robot can itself use to break down that barrier between people and robots , " he said .
blue or red hair ?
a short chat with anthropos suggested the researchers still have some way to go to make the robot convincing .
" i 'm trying to get more people to believe in me , " it said in a halting , robotic voice .
" i am thinking of getting some glasses .
it would make me look more intelligent .
" do you think i should wear such glasses ?
would i look better with blue hair or red hair ? " it asked .
but even with blue hair , the conversation ended up being one-sided , with anthropos ignoring a lot of the responses .

gibraltar is not the purpose of the meeting on monday , but it has climbed up the agenda because of major difficulties in the talks .
britain and spain have been trying to reach agreement for nearly 10 months on sharing sovereignty over gibraltar - the rock , as it is called , at the southern tip of spain which has been a british colony for nearly 300 years .
the two sides set themselves a rough deadline of this summer , now fast approaching , to do a deal - a political declaration of principles .
now , clearly , the crunch point has arrived .
that does not mean a decision will be announced or even taken at the london meeting .
but the two leaders will take stock of the three key problems and try to see a way through .
as one well-placed british source put it : " the spaniards have some positions that we simply ca n't accept . "
the first difficulty is the binding nature and duration of any deal .
the british government wants a permanent agreement , a definitive end to the historic dispute over gibraltar .
perhaps the word " permanent " need not appear in the document , but it must be absolutely crystal-clear that is what it means .
another british way of putting it is that an agreement on joint sovereignty must not be a slippery slope to total spanish sovereignty .
nato option the trouble is , spain undoubtedly sees the deal as a stepping-stone -lrb- rather than a slippery slope -rrb- to that ultimate ambition , which everyone knows it is not going to renounce formally .
the most the british would accept , it seems , is a reference to the historic spanish aspiration to recover gibraltar .
the second problem is the future of the british military base on the rock .
britain insists on keeping full operational control of the base , which it says is of key strategic importance .
spain has talked of sharing control , perhaps through nato .
in reply , the british source said they could not allow a spanish finger in the pie .
but the nato angle is significant .
at the moment , spain does not allow non-british ships to use the military base .
if there was a deal of the kind britain is thinking of , gibraltar would become a nato base , not an exclusively british one .
referendum the united states is in favour of that , and it would also bring economic benefits to local people .
the people of gibraltar are central to the third key problem in the negotiations - consent .
under the constitution drawn up for the territory in 1969 , the british government promised it would never allow them to " pass under the sovereignty of another state against their freely and democratically expressed wishes " .
the specific promise now is that the 30,000 gibraltarians will have the final say on implementing any agreement with spain in a referendum .
the spanish government has apparently argued that the referendum should not cover the principle of joint sovereignty itself - an idea the british side now describes as nonsense .
on the other hand , the senior british source said the spaniards were not being unreasonable in refusing to concede any principle of self-determination that would set a precedent for the basque minority of northern spain .
that was a real problem for them .
it is a classic diplomatic puzzle .
how to present the referendum in a way that enables madrid to argue that it is not self-determination , only a consultation exercise .
the gibraltar government , which is not taking part in the negotiations , is enraged by all this .
bound by treaty it has repeated its long-held position to a united nations committee that the un charter gives the people of the territory an unqualified right to self-determination - a right that can not be overridden by treaties or other international agreements .
britain maintains that it is bound by the treaty of utrecht of 1713 , under which spain ceded gibraltar to britain in perpetuity but which stipulates that if britain ever withdraws , spain should have the right to resume sovereignty .
whatever view you accept , the attitude of the gibraltarians is crucial and so far they are bitterly hostile to the proposed deal .
when the uk foreign secretary , jack straw , went to gibraltar , he was booed by demonstrators shouting " traitor " and " judas " .
for its part , the spanish government has made little effort to win over the people there .
mr aznar has warned them that maintaining the status quo would damage their interests - the failure of the deal , he said , meant that spain would continue to limit the use of gibraltar airport , the development of the territory and his government 's relations with britain .
an agreement between britain and spain still can not be ruled out .
but an authoritative british view is that there is a real danger of the negotiations collapsing .
if that happens , the lesson may be that both sides deluded themselves into believing that their respective red lines or sticking points could be reconciled .

an agreement between britain and spain still can not be ruled out .
but an authoritative british view is that there is a real danger of the negotiations collapsing .
if that happens , the lesson may be that both sides deluded themselves into believing that their respective red lines or sticking points could be reconciled .

the latest superbug is from the same family at mrsa - the bug which has become a serious problem in hospitals .
mrsa is a form of the staphylococcus bacterium that is resistant to the commonly used antibiotic methicillin .
but the new bug has also developed low-level resistance to vancomycin - which is widely regarded as the last line of defence against superbugs .
we must use all antibiotics very carefully if we are to minimise the emergence of resistance to antibiotics dr georgia duckworth the organism , called glycopeptide-intermediate staphylococcus aureus -lrb- gisa -rrb- , was found to have infected a hospital patient in england last month .
dr georgia duckworth , from the public health laboratory service , said : " with the development of antibiotic resistance , staphylococcus aureus infections have become harder to treat as there are fewer antibiotics that are effective .
" since the discovery of mrsa -lrb- methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus -rrb- , vancomycin has been the first choice antibiotic used in its treatment .
" although strains of staphylococcus aureus with low-level resistance to vancomycin have been identified before in japan , united states and france , as well as in scotland , this first gisa case in england is a serious development . "
treatment dr duckworth said the bug was still treatable by a number of drugs , including some which had only been introduced recently .
the patient concerned was successfully treated , but subsequently died from a cause unrelated to infection .
however , dr duckworth said the case underlined the growing problem of antibiotic resistance , and emphasised the problems associated with over-use of the drugs .
she said : " whenever we use an antibiotic , even if totally appropriately , we encourage the development of resistance to it .
" we must use all antibiotics very carefully if we are to minimise the emergence of resistance to antibiotics .
" once resistance has been detected , robust infection control practices are essential to contain the spread of such organisms .
" investigations in the affected hospital indicate that there has been no further spread of this organism . "
the case was reported in the phls publication communicable disease report weekly .
staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that lives harmlessly in the noses of around 20-30 % of healthy people in the population .
it only causes problems when it invades the body through wounds , causing infections and in serious cases blood poisoning .
around 100,000 patients a year pick up infections in hospitals .
it is thought that about 15 % of these are preventable , saving patients ' suffering and the nhs an estimated £ 150m a year .
