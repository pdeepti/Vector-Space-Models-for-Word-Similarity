the worldwide debate on paedophile priests in the catholic church hits germany , as a priest is suspended over charges of sexual abuse . the archdiocese of mainz has suspended a priest for allegedly repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old boy in the late 1980s .
according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel , the catholic priest sexually abused altar boys over a period of several years .
one victim has now stepped forward and formally accused the clergyman .
the archbishop of mainz and head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the church would investigate the allegations " quickly and intensively " .
in an official statement issued in response to the magazine article , lehmann said the church would " not refrain from taking the required consequences if necessary " .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests was sparked by the sex scandal engulfing the u.s. catholic church .
it has since ended the careers of four bishops and some 250 priests in the u.s. over similar alleged incidents .
still working on a standard procedure according to lehmann , the bishops ' conference was " thoroughly discussing " measures to prevent and deal with cases of " paedophile abnormalities " among church employees .
these would be adopted at the conference 's annual meeting in september .
" we have to ask ourselves , though , whether we need to proceed even more consistently , " lehmann said .
however , it was often difficult to clarify a case quickly and reliably .
he said adequate evidence would lead to the immediate suspension of the accused cleric , a procedure consistent with the demands of the pope and guidelines set up by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops .
" the church is in a learning process about this serious problem , as is society , " lehmann said .
more needs to be done but religious groups say the church is not doing enough .
the german grassroots organization " we are church " has accused the bishop 's conference of playing down the question of sexual abuse from priests .
it is n't sufficient to only set up criteria to deal with paedophile cases in the church , group spokesman christian weisner said .
it is demanding a central ombudsman for victims to turn to .
this office would work independently from the archdioceses , in order to ensure trustworthy help , he said .
weisner said his group welcomed cardinal lehmann 's change of position regarding paedophile priests .
in april , lehmann had not seen any necessity to look closer at possible cases in the german ranks following the us scandal .
" it 's good that lehmann now sees the need to act – i hope , he will also do something , " weisner said .
iggsm , an initiative against violence and sexual abuse of children and youth , also sharply criticized the bishop 's conference .

the worldwide debate on paedophile priests in the catholic church hits germany , as a priest is suspended over charges of sexual abuse . the archdiocese of mainz has suspended a priest for allegedly repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old boy in the late 1980s .
according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel , the catholic priest sexually abused altar boys over a period of several years .
one victim has now stepped forward and formally accused the clergyman .
the archbishop of mainz and head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the church would investigate the allegations " quickly and intensively " .
in an official statement issued in response to the magazine article , lehmann said the church would " not refrain from taking the required consequences if necessary " .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests was sparked by the sex scandal engulfing the u.s. catholic church .
it has since ended the careers of four bishops and some 250 priests in the u.s. over similar alleged incidents .
still working on a standard procedure according to lehmann , the bishops ' conference was " thoroughly discussing " measures to prevent and deal with cases of " paedophile abnormalities " among church employees .
these would be adopted at the conference 's annual meeting in september .
" we have to ask ourselves , though , whether we need to proceed even more consistently , " lehmann said .
however , it was often difficult to clarify a case quickly and reliably .
he said adequate evidence would lead to the immediate suspension of the accused cleric , a procedure consistent with the demands of the pope and guidelines set up by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops .
" the church is in a learning process about this serious problem , as is society , " lehmann said .
more needs to be done but religious groups say the church is not doing enough .
the german grassroots organization " we are church " has accused the bishop 's conference of playing down the question of sexual abuse from priests .
it is n't sufficient to only set up criteria to deal with paedophile cases in the church , group spokesman christian weisner said .
it is demanding a central ombudsman for victims to turn to .
this office would work independently from the archdioceses , in order to ensure trustworthy help , he said .
weisner said his group welcomed cardinal lehmann 's change of position regarding paedophile priests .
in april , lehmann had not seen any necessity to look closer at possible cases in the german ranks following the us scandal .
" it 's good that lehmann now sees the need to act – i hope , he will also do something , " weisner said .

both politicians and sports organizations hope the move will eliminate the use of steroids by athletes . germany is taking the fight against doping in the professional sports world very seriously , according to interior minister otto schily .
the establishment of the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- in bonn helps germany to " make headway in the fight against doping , " he said at a ceremony marking the founding of the organization .
nada will function as an independent institution .
it will have a full-time staff of five to organize both training controls , as well as the over 3,700 tests undertaken during competitions .
these were previously dealt with by individual sports federations .
the anti-doping commission -lrb- adc -rrb- of the german sports federation dsb and its counterpart in the national olympic committee will be dissolved with the creation of nada .
in the past , adc had two employees to deal with some 4,000 training controls annually .
the federal government has provided 5.1 million euro -lrb- $ 5.12 million -rrb- in funding , the largest chunk of the agency 's total starting capital of 6.6 million euro -lrb- $ 6.63 million -rrb- .
the federal states and the city of bonn have also contributed .
german companies deutsche telekom and deutsche bank have pledged a million euro -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- for the coming year .
little support from the private sector ulrich haas , who chaired the adc since 1992 and will be replaced in the new organization by peter busse , said there was otherwise little backing from private companies .
he criticized the pharmaceutical industry for not putting a penny into nada .
he said he had sought a dialog with the sector on several occasions , but to no avail .
the motives for this behavior remained a mystery , haas said .
if a company did n't see a personal advantage in contributing funds to an agency such as nada , it simply did not participate , he added .
hope for more developments in the former east germany , athletes were often forced to take performance enhancing drugs for years on end , and last year , the government reach an agreement to provide former athletes with a total of 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.045 million -rrb- in compensation .
yet , despite the international attention the east german abuses received , doping continues to be a problem for a reunified germany .
just a few weeks ago , former tour de france winner jan ullrich admitted to having taken amphetamines , and wrestler alexander leipold lost his sydney olympics gold medal after he tested positive for steroid use .
the country has worked hard to overcome past doping scandals , and haas stressed the importance that nada will have in that effort . it will add germany to the list of countries leading the battle against doping .
at the same time , he wished for more instruments to prosecute doping offenders , like those that exist italy .
there , taking illegal steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs is a crime .
in germany , athletes are only banned from competitions if found guilty of doping .
but there is no criminal prosecution , for example of trainers who are involved in doping .
" every once in a while , i look enviously at italy , which possibilities it offers , in particular to proceed against people in related areas and clean up the problem at its source . "
this strategy would only work in germany under the concept of fair play .

both politicians and sports organizations hope the move will eliminate the use of steroids by athletes . germany is taking the fight against doping in the professional sports world very seriously , according to interior minister otto schily .
the establishment of the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- in bonn helps germany to " make headway in the fight against doping , " he said at a ceremony marking the founding of the organization .
nada will function as an independent institution .
it will have a full-time staff of five to organize both training controls , as well as the over 3,700 tests undertaken during competitions .
these were previously dealt with by individual sports federations .
the anti-doping commission -lrb- adc -rrb- of the german sports federation dsb and its counterpart in the national olympic committee will be dissolved with the creation of nada .
in the past , adc had two employees to deal with some 4,000 training controls annually .
the federal government has provided 5.1 million euro -lrb- $ 5.12 million -rrb- in funding , the largest chunk of the agency 's total starting capital of 6.6 million euro -lrb- $ 6.63 million -rrb- .
the federal states and the city of bonn have also contributed .
german companies deutsche telekom and deutsche bank have pledged a million euro -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- for the coming year .
little support from the private sector ulrich haas , who chaired the adc since 1992 and will be replaced in the new organization by peter busse , said there was otherwise little backing from private companies .
he criticized the pharmaceutical industry for not putting a penny into nada .
he said he had sought a dialog with the sector on several occasions , but to no avail .
the motives for this behavior remained a mystery , haas said .
if a company did n't see a personal advantage in contributing funds to an agency such as nada , it simply did not participate , he added .
hope for more developments in the former east germany , athletes were often forced to take performance enhancing drugs for years on end , and last year , the government reach an agreement to provide former athletes with a total of 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.045 million -rrb- in compensation .
yet , despite the international attention the east german abuses received , doping continues to be a problem for a reunified germany .
just a few weeks ago , former tour de france winner jan ullrich admitted to having taken amphetamines , and wrestler alexander leipold lost his sydney olympics gold medal after he tested positive for steroid use .
the country has worked hard to overcome past doping scandals , and haas stressed the importance that nada will have in that effort . it will add germany to the list of countries leading the battle against doping .
at the same time , he wished for more instruments to prosecute doping offenders , like those that exist italy .
there , taking illegal steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs is a crime .
in germany , athletes are only banned from competitions if found guilty of doping .
but there is no criminal prosecution , for example of trainers who are involved in doping .
" every once in a while , i look enviously at italy , which possibilities it offers , in particular to proceed against people in related areas and clean up the problem at its source . "
this strategy would only work in germany under the concept of fair play .

the worldwide debate on paedophile priests in the catholic church hits germany , as a priest is suspended over charges of sexual abuse . the archdiocese of mainz has suspended a priest for allegedly repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old boy in the late 1980s .
according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel , the catholic priest sexually abused altar boys over a period of several years .
one victim has now stepped forward and formally accused the clergyman .
the archbishop of mainz and head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the church would investigate the allegations " quickly and intensively " .
in an official statement issued in response to the magazine article , lehmann said the church would " not refrain from taking the required consequences if necessary " .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests was sparked by the sex scandal engulfing the u.s. catholic church .
it has since ended the careers of four bishops and some 250 priests in the u.s. over similar alleged incidents .
still working on a standard procedure according to lehmann , the bishops ' conference was " thoroughly discussing " measures to prevent and deal with cases of " paedophile abnormalities " among church employees .
these would be adopted at the conference 's annual meeting in september .
" we have to ask ourselves , though , whether we need to proceed even more consistently , " lehmann said .
however , it was often difficult to clarify a case quickly and reliably .
he said adequate evidence would lead to the immediate suspension of the accused cleric , a procedure consistent with the demands of the pope and guidelines set up by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops .
" the church is in a learning process about this serious problem , as is society , " lehmann said .
more needs to be done but religious groups say the church is not doing enough .
the german grassroots organization " we are church " has accused the bishop 's conference of playing down the question of sexual abuse from priests .
it is n't sufficient to only set up criteria to deal with paedophile cases in the church , group spokesman christian weisner said .
it is demanding a central ombudsman for victims to turn to .
this office would work independently from the archdioceses , in order to ensure trustworthy help , he said .
weisner said his group welcomed cardinal lehmann 's change of position regarding paedophile priests .
in april , lehmann had not seen any necessity to look closer at possible cases in the german ranks following the us scandal .
" it 's good that lehmann now sees the need to act – i hope , he will also do something , " weisner said .
iggsm , an initiative against violence and sexual abuse of children and youth , also sharply criticized the bishop 's conference .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.07.2002 german priest accused of sexual abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal karl lehmann has promised to take the necessary steps to remove paedophile priests from the church .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests in the catholic church hits germany , as a priest is suspended over charges of sexual abuse . the archdiocese of mainz has suspended a priest for allegedly repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old boy in the late 1980s .
according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel , the catholic priest sexually abused altar boys over a period of several years .
one victim has now stepped forward and formally accused the clergyman .
the archbishop of mainz and head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the church would investigate the allegations " quickly and intensively " .
in an official statement issued in response to the magazine article , lehmann said the church would " not refrain from taking the required consequences if necessary " .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests was sparked by the sex scandal engulfing the u.s. catholic church .
it has since ended the careers of four bishops and some 250 priests in the u.s. over similar alleged incidents .
still working on a standard procedure according to lehmann , the bishops ' conference was " thoroughly discussing " measures to prevent and deal with cases of " paedophile abnormalities " among church employees .
these would be adopted at the conference 's annual meeting in september .
" we have to ask ourselves , though , whether we need to proceed even more consistently , " lehmann said .
however , it was often difficult to clarify a case quickly and reliably .
he said adequate evidence would lead to the immediate suspension of the accused cleric , a procedure consistent with the demands of the pope and guidelines set up by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops .
" the church is in a learning process about this serious problem , as is society , " lehmann said .
more needs to be done but religious groups say the church is not doing enough .
the german grassroots organization " we are church " has accused the bishop 's conference of playing down the question of sexual abuse from priests .
it is n't sufficient to only set up criteria to deal with paedophile cases in the church , group spokesman christian weisner said .
it is demanding a central ombudsman for victims to turn to .
this office would work independently from the archdioceses , in order to ensure trustworthy help , he said .
weisner said his group welcomed cardinal lehmann 's change of position regarding paedophile priests .
in april , lehmann had not seen any necessity to look closer at possible cases in the german ranks following the us scandal .
" it 's good that lehmann now sees the need to act – i hope , he will also do something , " weisner said .
iggsm , an initiative against violence and sexual abuse of children and youth , also sharply criticized the bishop 's conference .
it said the bishops need to agree quickly on a common procedure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

both politicians and sports organizations hope the move will eliminate the use of steroids by athletes . germany is taking the fight against doping in the professional sports world very seriously , according to interior minister otto schily .
the establishment of the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- in bonn helps germany to " make headway in the fight against doping , " he said at a ceremony marking the founding of the organization .
nada will function as an independent institution .
it will have a full-time staff of five to organize both training controls , as well as the over 3,700 tests undertaken during competitions .
these were previously dealt with by individual sports federations .
the anti-doping commission -lrb- adc -rrb- of the german sports federation dsb and its counterpart in the national olympic committee will be dissolved with the creation of nada .
in the past , adc had two employees to deal with some 4,000 training controls annually .

he said he had sought a dialog with the sector on several occasions , but to no avail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.07.2002 german priest accused of sexual abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal karl lehmann has promised to take the necessary steps to remove paedophile priests from the church .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests in the catholic church hits germany , as a priest is suspended over charges of sexual abuse . the archdiocese of mainz has suspended a priest for allegedly repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old boy in the late 1980s .
according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel , the catholic priest sexually abused altar boys over a period of several years .
one victim has now stepped forward and formally accused the clergyman .
the archbishop of mainz and head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the church would investigate the allegations " quickly and intensively " .
in an official statement issued in response to the magazine article , lehmann said the church would " not refrain from taking the required consequences if necessary " .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests was sparked by the sex scandal engulfing the u.s. catholic church .
it has since ended the careers of four bishops and some 250 priests in the u.s. over similar alleged incidents .
still working on a standard procedure according to lehmann , the bishops ' conference was " thoroughly discussing " measures to prevent and deal with cases of " paedophile abnormalities " among church employees .
these would be adopted at the conference 's annual meeting in september .
" we have to ask ourselves , though , whether we need to proceed even more consistently , " lehmann said .
however , it was often difficult to clarify a case quickly and reliably .
he said adequate evidence would lead to the immediate suspension of the accused cleric , a procedure consistent with the demands of the pope and guidelines set up by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops .
" the church is in a learning process about this serious problem , as is society , " lehmann said .
more needs to be done but religious groups say the church is not doing enough .
the german grassroots organization " we are church " has accused the bishop 's conference of playing down the question of sexual abuse from priests .
it is n't sufficient to only set up criteria to deal with paedophile cases in the church , group spokesman christian weisner said .
it is demanding a central ombudsman for victims to turn to .
this office would work independently from the archdioceses , in order to ensure trustworthy help , he said .
weisner said his group welcomed cardinal lehmann 's change of position regarding paedophile priests .
in april , lehmann had not seen any necessity to look closer at possible cases in the german ranks following the us scandal .
" it 's good that lehmann now sees the need to act – i hope , he will also do something , " weisner said .
iggsm , an initiative against violence and sexual abuse of children and youth , also sharply criticized the bishop 's conference .
it said the bishops need to agree quickly on a common procedure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .
the agriculture minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , bärbel höhn , said in an interview with public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk that some 8,500 tons of tainted pig feed are estimated to have landed on german farms and feed producing companies .
she said that the companies would now be examined and , if necessary , closed down .
yesterday , the german consumer protection ministry announced that further imports of feed contaminated with the medorxyprogesterone-acetate or mpa hormone are believed to have landed in large quantities in germany , belgium , denmark , sweden and france .
dutch authorities trace culprit holland , the world ’ s third-largest exporter of pork , is now under pressure from the european commission to shed light on the latest in a series of food safety scandals to hit europe .
" this is the sort of thing which starts off quite small and that then triggers off a broader contamination " , european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told reporters last week .
dutch authorities have already arrested one of the owners of the bankrupt belgian firm , " bioland / liquid sugars " that is suspected of having delivered contaminated feed to pig farms in holland .
but in a sign that the scandal is widening beyond estimated dimensions , health food authorities say they have also found mpa traces in materials bioland supplied to two soft drink firms , one of them believed to be based in germany .
since the last shipments of these soft drink syrups were in may 2001 , health authorities now fear that people could have already consumed the drinks .
german minister to push for action german minster for consumer protection and agriculture renate künast - who came under fire recently for information lapses by her ministry in the scandal regarding cancer-causing herbicide nitrofen in german animal feed - is expected to push for the publication of an eu-wide list of permitted ingredients in animal feed at the brussels meeting .
on german television monday morning , künast said the european feed-producing industry should be controlled more effectively .
the mpa hormone in the latest food scandal is banned in the eu as scientists believe it might cause infertility in humans if taken in high doses and for long periods .
but mpa is still used by humans in birth control pills and also in hormone replacement therapy for women going through menopause .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .
the agriculture minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , bärbel höhn , said in an interview with public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk that some 8,500 tons of tainted pig feed are estimated to have landed on german farms and feed producing companies .
she said that the companies would now be examined and , if necessary , closed down .
yesterday , the german consumer protection ministry announced that further imports of feed contaminated with the medorxyprogesterone-acetate or mpa hormone are believed to have landed in large quantities in germany , belgium , denmark , sweden and france .
dutch authorities trace culprit holland , the world ’ s third-largest exporter of pork , is now under pressure from the european commission to shed light on the latest in a series of food safety scandals to hit europe .
" this is the sort of thing which starts off quite small and that then triggers off a broader contamination " , european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told reporters last week .
dutch authorities have already arrested one of the owners of the bankrupt belgian firm , " bioland / liquid sugars " that is suspected of having delivered contaminated feed to pig farms in holland .
but in a sign that the scandal is widening beyond estimated dimensions , health food authorities say they have also found mpa traces in materials bioland supplied to two soft drink firms , one of them believed to be based in germany .
since the last shipments of these soft drink syrups were in may 2001 , health authorities now fear that people could have already consumed the drinks .
german minister to push for action german minster for consumer protection and agriculture renate künast - who came under fire recently for information lapses by her ministry in the scandal regarding cancer-causing herbicide nitrofen in german animal feed - is expected to push for the publication of an eu-wide list of permitted ingredients in animal feed at the brussels meeting .
on german television monday morning , künast said the european feed-producing industry should be controlled more effectively .
the mpa hormone in the latest food scandal is banned in the eu as scientists believe it might cause infertility in humans if taken in high doses and for long periods .
but mpa is still used by humans in birth control pills and also in hormone replacement therapy for women going through menopause .

both politicians and sports organizations hope the move will eliminate the use of steroids by athletes . germany is taking the fight against doping in the professional sports world very seriously , according to interior minister otto schily .
the establishment of the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- in bonn helps germany to " make headway in the fight against doping , " he said at a ceremony marking the founding of the organization .
nada will function as an independent institution .
it will have a full-time staff of five to organize both training controls , as well as the over 3,700 tests undertaken during competitions .
these were previously dealt with by individual sports federations .
the anti-doping commission -lrb- adc -rrb- of the german sports federation dsb and its counterpart in the national olympic committee will be dissolved with the creation of nada .
in the past , adc had two employees to deal with some 4,000 training controls annually .
the federal government has provided 5.1 million euro -lrb- $ 5.12 million -rrb- in funding , the largest chunk of the agency 's total starting capital of 6.6 million euro -lrb- $ 6.63 million -rrb- .
the federal states and the city of bonn have also contributed .
german companies deutsche telekom and deutsche bank have pledged a million euro -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- for the coming year .
little support from the private sector ulrich haas , who chaired the adc since 1992 and will be replaced in the new organization by peter busse , said there was otherwise little backing from private companies .
he criticized the pharmaceutical industry for not putting a penny into nada .
he said he had sought a dialog with the sector on several occasions , but to no avail .
the motives for this behavior remained a mystery , haas said .
if a company did n't see a personal advantage in contributing funds to an agency such as nada , it simply did not participate , he added .
hope for more developments in the former east germany , athletes were often forced to take performance enhancing drugs for years on end , and last year , the government reach an agreement to provide former athletes with a total of 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.045 million -rrb- in compensation .
yet , despite the international attention the east german abuses received , doping continues to be a problem for a reunified germany .
just a few weeks ago , former tour de france winner jan ullrich admitted to having taken amphetamines , and wrestler alexander leipold lost his sydney olympics gold medal after he tested positive for steroid use .
the country has worked hard to overcome past doping scandals , and haas stressed the importance that nada will have in that effort . it will add germany to the list of countries leading the battle against doping .
at the same time , he wished for more instruments to prosecute doping offenders , like those that exist italy .
there , taking illegal steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs is a crime .
in germany , athletes are only banned from competitions if found guilty of doping .
but there is no criminal prosecution , for example of trainers who are involved in doping .
" every once in a while , i look enviously at italy , which possibilities it offers , in particular to proceed against people in related areas and clean up the problem at its source . "

both politicians and sports organizations hope the move will eliminate the use of steroids by athletes . germany is taking the fight against doping in the professional sports world very seriously , according to interior minister otto schily .
the establishment of the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- in bonn helps germany to " make headway in the fight against doping , " he said at a ceremony marking the founding of the organization .
nada will function as an independent institution .
it will have a full-time staff of five to organize both training controls , as well as the over 3,700 tests undertaken during competitions .
these were previously dealt with by individual sports federations .
the anti-doping commission -lrb- adc -rrb- of the german sports federation dsb and its counterpart in the national olympic committee will be dissolved with the creation of nada .
in the past , adc had two employees to deal with some 4,000 training controls annually .
the federal government has provided 5.1 million euro -lrb- $ 5.12 million -rrb- in funding , the largest chunk of the agency 's total starting capital of 6.6 million euro -lrb- $ 6.63 million -rrb- .
the federal states and the city of bonn have also contributed .
german companies deutsche telekom and deutsche bank have pledged a million euro -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- for the coming year .
little support from the private sector ulrich haas , who chaired the adc since 1992 and will be replaced in the new organization by peter busse , said there was otherwise little backing from private companies .
he criticized the pharmaceutical industry for not putting a penny into nada .
he said he had sought a dialog with the sector on several occasions , but to no avail .
the motives for this behavior remained a mystery , haas said .
if a company did n't see a personal advantage in contributing funds to an agency such as nada , it simply did not participate , he added .
hope for more developments in the former east germany , athletes were often forced to take performance enhancing drugs for years on end , and last year , the government reach an agreement to provide former athletes with a total of 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.045 million -rrb- in compensation .
yet , despite the international attention the east german abuses received , doping continues to be a problem for a reunified germany .
just a few weeks ago , former tour de france winner jan ullrich admitted to having taken amphetamines , and wrestler alexander leipold lost his sydney olympics gold medal after he tested positive for steroid use .
the country has worked hard to overcome past doping scandals , and haas stressed the importance that nada will have in that effort . it will add germany to the list of countries leading the battle against doping .
at the same time , he wished for more instruments to prosecute doping offenders , like those that exist italy .
there , taking illegal steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs is a crime .
in germany , athletes are only banned from competitions if found guilty of doping .
but there is no criminal prosecution , for example of trainers who are involved in doping .
" every once in a while , i look enviously at italy , which possibilities it offers , in particular to proceed against people in related areas and clean up the problem at its source . "

the worldwide debate on paedophile priests in the catholic church hits germany , as a priest is suspended over charges of sexual abuse . the archdiocese of mainz has suspended a priest for allegedly repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old boy in the late 1980s .
according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel , the catholic priest sexually abused altar boys over a period of several years .
one victim has now stepped forward and formally accused the clergyman .
the archbishop of mainz and head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the church would investigate the allegations " quickly and intensively " .
in an official statement issued in response to the magazine article , lehmann said the church would " not refrain from taking the required consequences if necessary " .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests was sparked by the sex scandal engulfing the u.s. catholic church .
it has since ended the careers of four bishops and some 250 priests in the u.s. over similar alleged incidents .
still working on a standard procedure according to lehmann , the bishops ' conference was " thoroughly discussing " measures to prevent and deal with cases of " paedophile abnormalities " among church employees .
these would be adopted at the conference 's annual meeting in september .
" we have to ask ourselves , though , whether we need to proceed even more consistently , " lehmann said .
however , it was often difficult to clarify a case quickly and reliably .
he said adequate evidence would lead to the immediate suspension of the accused cleric , a procedure consistent with the demands of the pope and guidelines set up by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops .
" the church is in a learning process about this serious problem , as is society , " lehmann said .
more needs to be done but religious groups say the church is not doing enough .
the german grassroots organization " we are church " has accused the bishop 's conference of playing down the question of sexual abuse from priests .
it is n't sufficient to only set up criteria to deal with paedophile cases in the church , group spokesman christian weisner said .
it is demanding a central ombudsman for victims to turn to .
this office would work independently from the archdioceses , in order to ensure trustworthy help , he said .
weisner said his group welcomed cardinal lehmann 's change of position regarding paedophile priests .
in april , lehmann had not seen any necessity to look closer at possible cases in the german ranks following the us scandal .
" it 's good that lehmann now sees the need to act – i hope , he will also do something , " weisner said .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .
the agriculture minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , bärbel höhn , said in an interview with public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk that some 8,500 tons of tainted pig feed are estimated to have landed on german farms and feed producing companies .
she said that the companies would now be examined and , if necessary , closed down .
yesterday , the german consumer protection ministry announced that further imports of feed contaminated with the medorxyprogesterone-acetate or mpa hormone are believed to have landed in large quantities in germany , belgium , denmark , sweden and france .
dutch authorities trace culprit holland , the world ’ s third-largest exporter of pork , is now under pressure from the european commission to shed light on the latest in a series of food safety scandals to hit europe .
" this is the sort of thing which starts off quite small and that then triggers off a broader contamination " , european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told reporters last week .
dutch authorities have already arrested one of the owners of the bankrupt belgian firm , " bioland / liquid sugars " that is suspected of having delivered contaminated feed to pig farms in holland .
but in a sign that the scandal is widening beyond estimated dimensions , health food authorities say they have also found mpa traces in materials bioland supplied to two soft drink firms , one of them believed to be based in germany .
since the last shipments of these soft drink syrups were in may 2001 , health authorities now fear that people could have already consumed the drinks .
german minister to push for action german minster for consumer protection and agriculture renate künast - who came under fire recently for information lapses by her ministry in the scandal regarding cancer-causing herbicide nitrofen in german animal feed - is expected to push for the publication of an eu-wide list of permitted ingredients in animal feed at the brussels meeting .
on german television monday morning , künast said the european feed-producing industry should be controlled more effectively .
the mpa hormone in the latest food scandal is banned in the eu as scientists believe it might cause infertility in humans if taken in high doses and for long periods .
but mpa is still used by humans in birth control pills and also in hormone replacement therapy for women going through menopause .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .
the agriculture minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , bärbel höhn , said in an interview with public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk that some 8,500 tons of tainted pig feed are estimated to have landed on german farms and feed producing companies .
she said that the companies would now be examined and , if necessary , closed down .
yesterday , the german consumer protection ministry announced that further imports of feed contaminated with the medorxyprogesterone-acetate or mpa hormone are believed to have landed in large quantities in germany , belgium , denmark , sweden and france .
dutch authorities trace culprit holland , the world ’ s third-largest exporter of pork , is now under pressure from the european commission to shed light on the latest in a series of food safety scandals to hit europe .
" this is the sort of thing which starts off quite small and that then triggers off a broader contamination " , european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told reporters last week .
dutch authorities have already arrested one of the owners of the bankrupt belgian firm , " bioland / liquid sugars " that is suspected of having delivered contaminated feed to pig farms in holland .
but in a sign that the scandal is widening beyond estimated dimensions , health food authorities say they have also found mpa traces in materials bioland supplied to two soft drink firms , one of them believed to be based in germany .
since the last shipments of these soft drink syrups were in may 2001 , health authorities now fear that people could have already consumed the drinks .
german minister to push for action german minster for consumer protection and agriculture renate künast - who came under fire recently for information lapses by her ministry in the scandal regarding cancer-causing herbicide nitrofen in german animal feed - is expected to push for the publication of an eu-wide list of permitted ingredients in animal feed at the brussels meeting .
on german television monday morning , künast said the european feed-producing industry should be controlled more effectively .
the mpa hormone in the latest food scandal is banned in the eu as scientists believe it might cause infertility in humans if taken in high doses and for long periods .

both politicians and sports organizations hope the move will eliminate the use of steroids by athletes . germany is taking the fight against doping in the professional sports world very seriously , according to interior minister otto schily .
the establishment of the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- in bonn helps germany to " make headway in the fight against doping , " he said at a ceremony marking the founding of the organization .
nada will function as an independent institution .
it will have a full-time staff of five to organize both training controls , as well as the over 3,700 tests undertaken during competitions .
these were previously dealt with by individual sports federations .
the anti-doping commission -lrb- adc -rrb- of the german sports federation dsb and its counterpart in the national olympic committee will be dissolved with the creation of nada .
in the past , adc had two employees to deal with some 4,000 training controls annually .
the federal government has provided 5.1 million euro -lrb- $ 5.12 million -rrb- in funding , the largest chunk of the agency 's total starting capital of 6.6 million euro -lrb- $ 6.63 million -rrb- .
the federal states and the city of bonn have also contributed .
german companies deutsche telekom and deutsche bank have pledged a million euro -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- for the coming year .
little support from the private sector ulrich haas , who chaired the adc since 1992 and will be replaced in the new organization by peter busse , said there was otherwise little backing from private companies .
he criticized the pharmaceutical industry for not putting a penny into nada .
he said he had sought a dialog with the sector on several occasions , but to no avail .
the motives for this behavior remained a mystery , haas said .
if a company did n't see a personal advantage in contributing funds to an agency such as nada , it simply did not participate , he added .
hope for more developments in the former east germany , athletes were often forced to take performance enhancing drugs for years on end , and last year , the government reach an agreement to provide former athletes with a total of 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.045 million -rrb- in compensation .
yet , despite the international attention the east german abuses received , doping continues to be a problem for a reunified germany .
just a few weeks ago , former tour de france winner jan ullrich admitted to having taken amphetamines , and wrestler alexander leipold lost his sydney olympics gold medal after he tested positive for steroid use .
the country has worked hard to overcome past doping scandals , and haas stressed the importance that nada will have in that effort . it will add germany to the list of countries leading the battle against doping .
at the same time , he wished for more instruments to prosecute doping offenders , like those that exist italy .
there , taking illegal steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs is a crime .
in germany , athletes are only banned from competitions if found guilty of doping .
but there is no criminal prosecution , for example of trainers who are involved in doping .
" every once in a while , i look enviously at italy , which possibilities it offers , in particular to proceed against people in related areas and clean up the problem at its source . "
this strategy would only work in germany under the concept of fair play .
" if you look at it from a health perspective , then you have no possibilities for prosecution , " he said .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .
the agriculture minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , bärbel höhn , said in an interview with public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk that some 8,500 tons of tainted pig feed are estimated to have landed on german farms and feed producing companies .
she said that the companies would now be examined and , if necessary , closed down .
yesterday , the german consumer protection ministry announced that further imports of feed contaminated with the medorxyprogesterone-acetate or mpa hormone are believed to have landed in large quantities in germany , belgium , denmark , sweden and france .
dutch authorities trace culprit holland , the world ’ s third-largest exporter of pork , is now under pressure from the european commission to shed light on the latest in a series of food safety scandals to hit europe .
" this is the sort of thing which starts off quite small and that then triggers off a broader contamination " , european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told reporters last week .
dutch authorities have already arrested one of the owners of the bankrupt belgian firm , " bioland / liquid sugars " that is suspected of having delivered contaminated feed to pig farms in holland .
but in a sign that the scandal is widening beyond estimated dimensions , health food authorities say they have also found mpa traces in materials bioland supplied to two soft drink firms , one of them believed to be based in germany .
since the last shipments of these soft drink syrups were in may 2001 , health authorities now fear that people could have already consumed the drinks .
german minister to push for action german minster for consumer protection and agriculture renate künast - who came under fire recently for information lapses by her ministry in the scandal regarding cancer-causing herbicide nitrofen in german animal feed - is expected to push for the publication of an eu-wide list of permitted ingredients in animal feed at the brussels meeting .
on german television monday morning , künast said the european feed-producing industry should be controlled more effectively .
the mpa hormone in the latest food scandal is banned in the eu as scientists believe it might cause infertility in humans if taken in high doses and for long periods .
but mpa is still used by humans in birth control pills and also in hormone replacement therapy for women going through menopause .
it is also approved as a growth stimulant in animal feed in the united states , australia and new zealand . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agriculture reforms could pinch east german farmers the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers .

yesterday , the german consumer protection ministry announced that further imports of feed contaminated with the medorxyprogesterone-acetate or mpa hormone are believed to have landed in large quantities in germany , belgium , denmark , sweden and france .
dutch authorities trace culprit holland , the world ’ s third-largest exporter of pork , is now under pressure from the european commission to shed light on the latest in a series of food safety scandals to hit europe .
" this is the sort of thing which starts off quite small and that then triggers off a broader contamination " , european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told reporters last week .
dutch authorities have already arrested one of the owners of the bankrupt belgian firm , " bioland / liquid sugars " that is suspected of having delivered contaminated feed to pig farms in holland .
but in a sign that the scandal is widening beyond estimated dimensions , health food authorities say they have also found mpa traces in materials bioland supplied to two soft drink firms , one of them believed to be based in germany .
since the last shipments of these soft drink syrups were in may 2001 , health authorities now fear that people could have already consumed the drinks .

the mpa hormone in the latest food scandal is banned in the eu as scientists believe it might cause infertility in humans if taken in high doses and for long periods .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .

both politicians and sports organizations hope the move will eliminate the use of steroids by athletes . germany is taking the fight against doping in the professional sports world very seriously , according to interior minister otto schily .
the establishment of the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- in bonn helps germany to " make headway in the fight against doping , " he said at a ceremony marking the founding of the organization .
nada will function as an independent institution .
it will have a full-time staff of five to organize both training controls , as well as the over 3,700 tests undertaken during competitions .
these were previously dealt with by individual sports federations .
the anti-doping commission -lrb- adc -rrb- of the german sports federation dsb and its counterpart in the national olympic committee will be dissolved with the creation of nada .
in the past , adc had two employees to deal with some 4,000 training controls annually .
the federal government has provided 5.1 million euro -lrb- $ 5.12 million -rrb- in funding , the largest chunk of the agency 's total starting capital of 6.6 million euro -lrb- $ 6.63 million -rrb- .
the federal states and the city of bonn have also contributed .
german companies deutsche telekom and deutsche bank have pledged a million euro -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- for the coming year .
little support from the private sector ulrich haas , who chaired the adc since 1992 and will be replaced in the new organization by peter busse , said there was otherwise little backing from private companies .
he criticized the pharmaceutical industry for not putting a penny into nada .
he said he had sought a dialog with the sector on several occasions , but to no avail .
the motives for this behavior remained a mystery , haas said .
if a company did n't see a personal advantage in contributing funds to an agency such as nada , it simply did not participate , he added .
hope for more developments in the former east germany , athletes were often forced to take performance enhancing drugs for years on end , and last year , the government reach an agreement to provide former athletes with a total of 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.045 million -rrb- in compensation .
yet , despite the international attention the east german abuses received , doping continues to be a problem for a reunified germany .
just a few weeks ago , former tour de france winner jan ullrich admitted to having taken amphetamines , and wrestler alexander leipold lost his sydney olympics gold medal after he tested positive for steroid use .
the country has worked hard to overcome past doping scandals , and haas stressed the importance that nada will have in that effort . it will add germany to the list of countries leading the battle against doping .
at the same time , he wished for more instruments to prosecute doping offenders , like those that exist italy .
there , taking illegal steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs is a crime .
in germany , athletes are only banned from competitions if found guilty of doping .
but there is no criminal prosecution , for example of trainers who are involved in doping .
" every once in a while , i look enviously at italy , which possibilities it offers , in particular to proceed against people in related areas and clean up the problem at its source . "

both politicians and sports organizations hope the move will eliminate the use of steroids by athletes . germany is taking the fight against doping in the professional sports world very seriously , according to interior minister otto schily .
the establishment of the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- in bonn helps germany to " make headway in the fight against doping , " he said at a ceremony marking the founding of the organization .
nada will function as an independent institution .
it will have a full-time staff of five to organize both training controls , as well as the over 3,700 tests undertaken during competitions .
these were previously dealt with by individual sports federations .
the anti-doping commission -lrb- adc -rrb- of the german sports federation dsb and its counterpart in the national olympic committee will be dissolved with the creation of nada .
in the past , adc had two employees to deal with some 4,000 training controls annually .
the federal government has provided 5.1 million euro -lrb- $ 5.12 million -rrb- in funding , the largest chunk of the agency 's total starting capital of 6.6 million euro -lrb- $ 6.63 million -rrb- .
the federal states and the city of bonn have also contributed .
german companies deutsche telekom and deutsche bank have pledged a million euro -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- for the coming year .
little support from the private sector ulrich haas , who chaired the adc since 1992 and will be replaced in the new organization by peter busse , said there was otherwise little backing from private companies .
he criticized the pharmaceutical industry for not putting a penny into nada .
he said he had sought a dialog with the sector on several occasions , but to no avail .
the motives for this behavior remained a mystery , haas said .
if a company did n't see a personal advantage in contributing funds to an agency such as nada , it simply did not participate , he added .
hope for more developments in the former east germany , athletes were often forced to take performance enhancing drugs for years on end , and last year , the government reach an agreement to provide former athletes with a total of 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.045 million -rrb- in compensation .
yet , despite the international attention the east german abuses received , doping continues to be a problem for a reunified germany .
just a few weeks ago , former tour de france winner jan ullrich admitted to having taken amphetamines , and wrestler alexander leipold lost his sydney olympics gold medal after he tested positive for steroid use .
the country has worked hard to overcome past doping scandals , and haas stressed the importance that nada will have in that effort . it will add germany to the list of countries leading the battle against doping .
at the same time , he wished for more instruments to prosecute doping offenders , like those that exist italy .
there , taking illegal steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs is a crime .
in germany , athletes are only banned from competitions if found guilty of doping .
but there is no criminal prosecution , for example of trainers who are involved in doping .
" every once in a while , i look enviously at italy , which possibilities it offers , in particular to proceed against people in related areas and clean up the problem at its source . "
this strategy would only work in germany under the concept of fair play .

the worldwide debate on paedophile priests in the catholic church hits germany , as a priest is suspended over charges of sexual abuse . the archdiocese of mainz has suspended a priest for allegedly repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old boy in the late 1980s .
according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel , the catholic priest sexually abused altar boys over a period of several years .
one victim has now stepped forward and formally accused the clergyman .
the archbishop of mainz and head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the church would investigate the allegations " quickly and intensively " .
in an official statement issued in response to the magazine article , lehmann said the church would " not refrain from taking the required consequences if necessary " .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests was sparked by the sex scandal engulfing the u.s. catholic church .
it has since ended the careers of four bishops and some 250 priests in the u.s. over similar alleged incidents .
still working on a standard procedure according to lehmann , the bishops ' conference was " thoroughly discussing " measures to prevent and deal with cases of " paedophile abnormalities " among church employees .
these would be adopted at the conference 's annual meeting in september .
" we have to ask ourselves , though , whether we need to proceed even more consistently , " lehmann said .
however , it was often difficult to clarify a case quickly and reliably .
he said adequate evidence would lead to the immediate suspension of the accused cleric , a procedure consistent with the demands of the pope and guidelines set up by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops .
" the church is in a learning process about this serious problem , as is society , " lehmann said .
more needs to be done but religious groups say the church is not doing enough .
the german grassroots organization " we are church " has accused the bishop 's conference of playing down the question of sexual abuse from priests .
it is n't sufficient to only set up criteria to deal with paedophile cases in the church , group spokesman christian weisner said .
it is demanding a central ombudsman for victims to turn to .
this office would work independently from the archdioceses , in order to ensure trustworthy help , he said .
weisner said his group welcomed cardinal lehmann 's change of position regarding paedophile priests .
in april , lehmann had not seen any necessity to look closer at possible cases in the german ranks following the us scandal .
" it 's good that lehmann now sees the need to act – i hope , he will also do something , " weisner said .
iggsm , an initiative against violence and sexual abuse of children and youth , also sharply criticized the bishop 's conference .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .
the agriculture minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , bärbel höhn , said in an interview with public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk that some 8,500 tons of tainted pig feed are estimated to have landed on german farms and feed producing companies .
she said that the companies would now be examined and , if necessary , closed down .
yesterday , the german consumer protection ministry announced that further imports of feed contaminated with the medorxyprogesterone-acetate or mpa hormone are believed to have landed in large quantities in germany , belgium , denmark , sweden and france .
dutch authorities trace culprit holland , the world ’ s third-largest exporter of pork , is now under pressure from the european commission to shed light on the latest in a series of food safety scandals to hit europe .
" this is the sort of thing which starts off quite small and that then triggers off a broader contamination " , european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told reporters last week .
dutch authorities have already arrested one of the owners of the bankrupt belgian firm , " bioland / liquid sugars " that is suspected of having delivered contaminated feed to pig farms in holland .
but in a sign that the scandal is widening beyond estimated dimensions , health food authorities say they have also found mpa traces in materials bioland supplied to two soft drink firms , one of them believed to be based in germany .
since the last shipments of these soft drink syrups were in may 2001 , health authorities now fear that people could have already consumed the drinks .
german minister to push for action german minster for consumer protection and agriculture renate künast - who came under fire recently for information lapses by her ministry in the scandal regarding cancer-causing herbicide nitrofen in german animal feed - is expected to push for the publication of an eu-wide list of permitted ingredients in animal feed at the brussels meeting .
on german television monday morning , künast said the european feed-producing industry should be controlled more effectively .
the mpa hormone in the latest food scandal is banned in the eu as scientists believe it might cause infertility in humans if taken in high doses and for long periods .
but mpa is still used by humans in birth control pills and also in hormone replacement therapy for women going through menopause .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .
the agriculture minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , bärbel höhn , said in an interview with public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk that some 8,500 tons of tainted pig feed are estimated to have landed on german farms and feed producing companies .
she said that the companies would now be examined and , if necessary , closed down .
yesterday , the german consumer protection ministry announced that further imports of feed contaminated with the medorxyprogesterone-acetate or mpa hormone are believed to have landed in large quantities in germany , belgium , denmark , sweden and france .
dutch authorities trace culprit holland , the world ’ s third-largest exporter of pork , is now under pressure from the european commission to shed light on the latest in a series of food safety scandals to hit europe .
" this is the sort of thing which starts off quite small and that then triggers off a broader contamination " , european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told reporters last week .
dutch authorities have already arrested one of the owners of the bankrupt belgian firm , " bioland / liquid sugars " that is suspected of having delivered contaminated feed to pig farms in holland .
but in a sign that the scandal is widening beyond estimated dimensions , health food authorities say they have also found mpa traces in materials bioland supplied to two soft drink firms , one of them believed to be based in germany .
since the last shipments of these soft drink syrups were in may 2001 , health authorities now fear that people could have already consumed the drinks .
german minister to push for action german minster for consumer protection and agriculture renate künast - who came under fire recently for information lapses by her ministry in the scandal regarding cancer-causing herbicide nitrofen in german animal feed - is expected to push for the publication of an eu-wide list of permitted ingredients in animal feed at the brussels meeting .
on german television monday morning , künast said the european feed-producing industry should be controlled more effectively .
the mpa hormone in the latest food scandal is banned in the eu as scientists believe it might cause infertility in humans if taken in high doses and for long periods .
but mpa is still used by humans in birth control pills and also in hormone replacement therapy for women going through menopause .
it is also approved as a growth stimulant in animal feed in the united states , australia and new zealand . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agriculture reforms could pinch east german farmers the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.07.2002 german priest accused of sexual abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal karl lehmann has promised to take the necessary steps to remove paedophile priests from the church .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests in the catholic church hits germany , as a priest is suspended over charges of sexual abuse . the archdiocese of mainz has suspended a priest for allegedly repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old boy in the late 1980s .
according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel , the catholic priest sexually abused altar boys over a period of several years .
one victim has now stepped forward and formally accused the clergyman .
the archbishop of mainz and head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the church would investigate the allegations " quickly and intensively " .
in an official statement issued in response to the magazine article , lehmann said the church would " not refrain from taking the required consequences if necessary " .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests was sparked by the sex scandal engulfing the u.s. catholic church .
it has since ended the careers of four bishops and some 250 priests in the u.s. over similar alleged incidents .
still working on a standard procedure according to lehmann , the bishops ' conference was " thoroughly discussing " measures to prevent and deal with cases of " paedophile abnormalities " among church employees .
these would be adopted at the conference 's annual meeting in september .
" we have to ask ourselves , though , whether we need to proceed even more consistently , " lehmann said .
however , it was often difficult to clarify a case quickly and reliably .
he said adequate evidence would lead to the immediate suspension of the accused cleric , a procedure consistent with the demands of the pope and guidelines set up by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops .
" the church is in a learning process about this serious problem , as is society , " lehmann said .
more needs to be done but religious groups say the church is not doing enough .
the german grassroots organization " we are church " has accused the bishop 's conference of playing down the question of sexual abuse from priests .
it is n't sufficient to only set up criteria to deal with paedophile cases in the church , group spokesman christian weisner said .
it is demanding a central ombudsman for victims to turn to .
this office would work independently from the archdioceses , in order to ensure trustworthy help , he said .
weisner said his group welcomed cardinal lehmann 's change of position regarding paedophile priests .
in april , lehmann had not seen any necessity to look closer at possible cases in the german ranks following the us scandal .
" it 's good that lehmann now sees the need to act – i hope , he will also do something , " weisner said .
iggsm , an initiative against violence and sexual abuse of children and youth , also sharply criticized the bishop 's conference .

both politicians and sports organizations hope the move will eliminate the use of steroids by athletes . germany is taking the fight against doping in the professional sports world very seriously , according to interior minister otto schily .
the establishment of the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- in bonn helps germany to " make headway in the fight against doping , " he said at a ceremony marking the founding of the organization .
nada will function as an independent institution .
it will have a full-time staff of five to organize both training controls , as well as the over 3,700 tests undertaken during competitions .
these were previously dealt with by individual sports federations .
the anti-doping commission -lrb- adc -rrb- of the german sports federation dsb and its counterpart in the national olympic committee will be dissolved with the creation of nada .
in the past , adc had two employees to deal with some 4,000 training controls annually .

he said he had sought a dialog with the sector on several occasions , but to no avail .

yet , despite the international attention the east german abuses received , doping continues to be a problem for a reunified germany .
just a few weeks ago , former tour de france winner jan ullrich admitted to having taken amphetamines , and wrestler alexander leipold lost his sydney olympics gold medal after he tested positive for steroid use .
the country has worked hard to overcome past doping scandals , and haas stressed the importance that nada will have in that effort . it will add germany to the list of countries leading the battle against doping .
at the same time , he wished for more instruments to prosecute doping offenders , like those that exist italy .

the establishment of the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- in bonn helps germany to " make headway in the fight against doping , " he said at a ceremony marking the founding of the organization .
nada will function as an independent institution .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .
the agriculture minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , bärbel höhn , said in an interview with public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk that some 8,500 tons of tainted pig feed are estimated to have landed on german farms and feed producing companies .
she said that the companies would now be examined and , if necessary , closed down .
yesterday , the german consumer protection ministry announced that further imports of feed contaminated with the medorxyprogesterone-acetate or mpa hormone are believed to have landed in large quantities in germany , belgium , denmark , sweden and france .
dutch authorities trace culprit holland , the world ’ s third-largest exporter of pork , is now under pressure from the european commission to shed light on the latest in a series of food safety scandals to hit europe .
" this is the sort of thing which starts off quite small and that then triggers off a broader contamination " , european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told reporters last week .
dutch authorities have already arrested one of the owners of the bankrupt belgian firm , " bioland / liquid sugars " that is suspected of having delivered contaminated feed to pig farms in holland .
but in a sign that the scandal is widening beyond estimated dimensions , health food authorities say they have also found mpa traces in materials bioland supplied to two soft drink firms , one of them believed to be based in germany .
since the last shipments of these soft drink syrups were in may 2001 , health authorities now fear that people could have already consumed the drinks .
german minister to push for action german minster for consumer protection and agriculture renate künast - who came under fire recently for information lapses by her ministry in the scandal regarding cancer-causing herbicide nitrofen in german animal feed - is expected to push for the publication of an eu-wide list of permitted ingredients in animal feed at the brussels meeting .
on german television monday morning , künast said the european feed-producing industry should be controlled more effectively .
the mpa hormone in the latest food scandal is banned in the eu as scientists believe it might cause infertility in humans if taken in high doses and for long periods .
but mpa is still used by humans in birth control pills and also in hormone replacement therapy for women going through menopause .
it is also approved as a growth stimulant in animal feed in the united states , australia and new zealand . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agriculture reforms could pinch east german farmers the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers .

but in a sign that the scandal is widening beyond estimated dimensions , health food authorities say they have also found mpa traces in materials bioland supplied to two soft drink firms , one of them believed to be based in germany .
since the last shipments of these soft drink syrups were in may 2001 , health authorities now fear that people could have already consumed the drinks .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .
the agriculture minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , bärbel höhn , said in an interview with public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk that some 8,500 tons of tainted pig feed are estimated to have landed on german farms and feed producing companies .
she said that the companies would now be examined and , if necessary , closed down .
yesterday , the german consumer protection ministry announced that further imports of feed contaminated with the medorxyprogesterone-acetate or mpa hormone are believed to have landed in large quantities in germany , belgium , denmark , sweden and france .
dutch authorities trace culprit holland , the world ’ s third-largest exporter of pork , is now under pressure from the european commission to shed light on the latest in a series of food safety scandals to hit europe .
" this is the sort of thing which starts off quite small and that then triggers off a broader contamination " , european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told reporters last week .
dutch authorities have already arrested one of the owners of the bankrupt belgian firm , " bioland / liquid sugars " that is suspected of having delivered contaminated feed to pig farms in holland .

both politicians and sports organizations hope the move will eliminate the use of steroids by athletes . germany is taking the fight against doping in the professional sports world very seriously , according to interior minister otto schily .
the establishment of the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- in bonn helps germany to " make headway in the fight against doping , " he said at a ceremony marking the founding of the organization .
nada will function as an independent institution .
it will have a full-time staff of five to organize both training controls , as well as the over 3,700 tests undertaken during competitions .
these were previously dealt with by individual sports federations .
the anti-doping commission -lrb- adc -rrb- of the german sports federation dsb and its counterpart in the national olympic committee will be dissolved with the creation of nada .
in the past , adc had two employees to deal with some 4,000 training controls annually .
the federal government has provided 5.1 million euro -lrb- $ 5.12 million -rrb- in funding , the largest chunk of the agency 's total starting capital of 6.6 million euro -lrb- $ 6.63 million -rrb- .
the federal states and the city of bonn have also contributed .
german companies deutsche telekom and deutsche bank have pledged a million euro -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- for the coming year .
little support from the private sector ulrich haas , who chaired the adc since 1992 and will be replaced in the new organization by peter busse , said there was otherwise little backing from private companies .
he criticized the pharmaceutical industry for not putting a penny into nada .
he said he had sought a dialog with the sector on several occasions , but to no avail .
the motives for this behavior remained a mystery , haas said .
if a company did n't see a personal advantage in contributing funds to an agency such as nada , it simply did not participate , he added .
hope for more developments in the former east germany , athletes were often forced to take performance enhancing drugs for years on end , and last year , the government reach an agreement to provide former athletes with a total of 2 million euro -lrb- $ 2.045 million -rrb- in compensation .
yet , despite the international attention the east german abuses received , doping continues to be a problem for a reunified germany .
just a few weeks ago , former tour de france winner jan ullrich admitted to having taken amphetamines , and wrestler alexander leipold lost his sydney olympics gold medal after he tested positive for steroid use .
the country has worked hard to overcome past doping scandals , and haas stressed the importance that nada will have in that effort . it will add germany to the list of countries leading the battle against doping .
at the same time , he wished for more instruments to prosecute doping offenders , like those that exist italy .
there , taking illegal steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs is a crime .
in germany , athletes are only banned from competitions if found guilty of doping .
but there is no criminal prosecution , for example of trainers who are involved in doping .
" every once in a while , i look enviously at italy , which possibilities it offers , in particular to proceed against people in related areas and clean up the problem at its source . "
this strategy would only work in germany under the concept of fair play .
" if you look at it from a health perspective , then you have no possibilities for prosecution , " he said .
" hurting yourself is just not a crime in germany . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links world anti-doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- " think positive , test negative " 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the worldwide debate on paedophile priests in the catholic church hits germany , as a priest is suspended over charges of sexual abuse . the archdiocese of mainz has suspended a priest for allegedly repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old boy in the late 1980s .
according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel , the catholic priest sexually abused altar boys over a period of several years .
one victim has now stepped forward and formally accused the clergyman .
the archbishop of mainz and head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the church would investigate the allegations " quickly and intensively " .
in an official statement issued in response to the magazine article , lehmann said the church would " not refrain from taking the required consequences if necessary " .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests was sparked by the sex scandal engulfing the u.s. catholic church .
it has since ended the careers of four bishops and some 250 priests in the u.s. over similar alleged incidents .
still working on a standard procedure according to lehmann , the bishops ' conference was " thoroughly discussing " measures to prevent and deal with cases of " paedophile abnormalities " among church employees .
these would be adopted at the conference 's annual meeting in september .
" we have to ask ourselves , though , whether we need to proceed even more consistently , " lehmann said .
however , it was often difficult to clarify a case quickly and reliably .
he said adequate evidence would lead to the immediate suspension of the accused cleric , a procedure consistent with the demands of the pope and guidelines set up by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops .
" the church is in a learning process about this serious problem , as is society , " lehmann said .
more needs to be done but religious groups say the church is not doing enough .
the german grassroots organization " we are church " has accused the bishop 's conference of playing down the question of sexual abuse from priests .
it is n't sufficient to only set up criteria to deal with paedophile cases in the church , group spokesman christian weisner said .
it is demanding a central ombudsman for victims to turn to .
this office would work independently from the archdioceses , in order to ensure trustworthy help , he said .
weisner said his group welcomed cardinal lehmann 's change of position regarding paedophile priests .
in april , lehmann had not seen any necessity to look closer at possible cases in the german ranks following the us scandal .
" it 's good that lehmann now sees the need to act – i hope , he will also do something , " weisner said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.07.2002 german priest accused of sexual abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal karl lehmann has promised to take the necessary steps to remove paedophile priests from the church .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests in the catholic church hits germany , as a priest is suspended over charges of sexual abuse . the archdiocese of mainz has suspended a priest for allegedly repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old boy in the late 1980s .
according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel , the catholic priest sexually abused altar boys over a period of several years .
one victim has now stepped forward and formally accused the clergyman .
the archbishop of mainz and head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the church would investigate the allegations " quickly and intensively " .
in an official statement issued in response to the magazine article , lehmann said the church would " not refrain from taking the required consequences if necessary " .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests was sparked by the sex scandal engulfing the u.s. catholic church .
it has since ended the careers of four bishops and some 250 priests in the u.s. over similar alleged incidents .
still working on a standard procedure according to lehmann , the bishops ' conference was " thoroughly discussing " measures to prevent and deal with cases of " paedophile abnormalities " among church employees .
these would be adopted at the conference 's annual meeting in september .
" we have to ask ourselves , though , whether we need to proceed even more consistently , " lehmann said .
however , it was often difficult to clarify a case quickly and reliably .
he said adequate evidence would lead to the immediate suspension of the accused cleric , a procedure consistent with the demands of the pope and guidelines set up by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops .
" the church is in a learning process about this serious problem , as is society , " lehmann said .
more needs to be done but religious groups say the church is not doing enough .
the german grassroots organization " we are church " has accused the bishop 's conference of playing down the question of sexual abuse from priests .
it is n't sufficient to only set up criteria to deal with paedophile cases in the church , group spokesman christian weisner said .
it is demanding a central ombudsman for victims to turn to .
this office would work independently from the archdioceses , in order to ensure trustworthy help , he said .
weisner said his group welcomed cardinal lehmann 's change of position regarding paedophile priests .
in april , lehmann had not seen any necessity to look closer at possible cases in the german ranks following the us scandal .
" it 's good that lehmann now sees the need to act – i hope , he will also do something , " weisner said .
iggsm , an initiative against violence and sexual abuse of children and youth , also sharply criticized the bishop 's conference .
it said the bishops need to agree quickly on a common procedure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

both politicians and sports organizations hope the move will eliminate the use of steroids by athletes . germany is taking the fight against doping in the professional sports world very seriously , according to interior minister otto schily .
the establishment of the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- in bonn helps germany to " make headway in the fight against doping , " he said at a ceremony marking the founding of the organization .
nada will function as an independent institution .
it will have a full-time staff of five to organize both training controls , as well as the over 3,700 tests undertaken during competitions .
these were previously dealt with by individual sports federations .
the anti-doping commission -lrb- adc -rrb- of the german sports federation dsb and its counterpart in the national olympic committee will be dissolved with the creation of nada .
in the past , adc had two employees to deal with some 4,000 training controls annually .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .
the agriculture minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , bärbel höhn , said in an interview with public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk that some 8,500 tons of tainted pig feed are estimated to have landed on german farms and feed producing companies .
she said that the companies would now be examined and , if necessary , closed down .
yesterday , the german consumer protection ministry announced that further imports of feed contaminated with the medorxyprogesterone-acetate or mpa hormone are believed to have landed in large quantities in germany , belgium , denmark , sweden and france .
dutch authorities trace culprit holland , the world ’ s third-largest exporter of pork , is now under pressure from the european commission to shed light on the latest in a series of food safety scandals to hit europe .
" this is the sort of thing which starts off quite small and that then triggers off a broader contamination " , european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told reporters last week .
dutch authorities have already arrested one of the owners of the bankrupt belgian firm , " bioland / liquid sugars " that is suspected of having delivered contaminated feed to pig farms in holland .
but in a sign that the scandal is widening beyond estimated dimensions , health food authorities say they have also found mpa traces in materials bioland supplied to two soft drink firms , one of them believed to be based in germany .
since the last shipments of these soft drink syrups were in may 2001 , health authorities now fear that people could have already consumed the drinks .
german minister to push for action german minster for consumer protection and agriculture renate künast - who came under fire recently for information lapses by her ministry in the scandal regarding cancer-causing herbicide nitrofen in german animal feed - is expected to push for the publication of an eu-wide list of permitted ingredients in animal feed at the brussels meeting .
on german television monday morning , künast said the european feed-producing industry should be controlled more effectively .
the mpa hormone in the latest food scandal is banned in the eu as scientists believe it might cause infertility in humans if taken in high doses and for long periods .
but mpa is still used by humans in birth control pills and also in hormone replacement therapy for women going through menopause .
it is also approved as a growth stimulant in animal feed in the united states , australia and new zealand . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agriculture reforms could pinch east german farmers the head of the brussels bureau of the german farmers association says the european commission 's radical new agricultural reforms will disproportionately harm eastern german farmers .

eu agriculture ministers are meeting today to discuss radical proposals to the common agricultural policy .
also on the agenda is the issue of hormone-laced pig feed from holland that is seeping into european countries . a stormy and intense meeting is expected in brussels monday among agriculture ministers from across the european union .
it ’ s the first time the ministers will debate the controversial agricultural changes to the eu ’ s common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- approved last week by the european commission .
it would in effect sever the link between the amount of financial aid given to european farmers and the amount of milk , grain or meat they produce .
parts of the meeting will be televised , and ministers are expected to take a tough line keeping in mind that their farmers at home will be expecting them to defend their interests .
eu organisers are also expecting protests and demonstrations by farmers in brussels .
hormone-tainted pig feed hits germany but while the radical changes to the cap are expected to dominate the meeting , agriculture ministers will also turn their attention to another pressing problem of pig feed contaminated with banned growth hormones from the netherlands finding its way to farms in neighbouring countries .
germany remains one of the worst-hit , with some 100 farms particularly in the western states of north rhine-westphalia and lower saxony affected on account of their proximity to holland .
the agriculture minister of the state of north rhine-westphalia , bärbel höhn , said in an interview with public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk that some 8,500 tons of tainted pig feed are estimated to have landed on german farms and feed producing companies .
she said that the companies would now be examined and , if necessary , closed down .
yesterday , the german consumer protection ministry announced that further imports of feed contaminated with the medorxyprogesterone-acetate or mpa hormone are believed to have landed in large quantities in germany , belgium , denmark , sweden and france .
dutch authorities trace culprit holland , the world ’ s third-largest exporter of pork , is now under pressure from the european commission to shed light on the latest in a series of food safety scandals to hit europe .
" this is the sort of thing which starts off quite small and that then triggers off a broader contamination " , european commission spokeswoman beate gminder told reporters last week .
dutch authorities have already arrested one of the owners of the bankrupt belgian firm , " bioland / liquid sugars " that is suspected of having delivered contaminated feed to pig farms in holland .
but in a sign that the scandal is widening beyond estimated dimensions , health food authorities say they have also found mpa traces in materials bioland supplied to two soft drink firms , one of them believed to be based in germany .
since the last shipments of these soft drink syrups were in may 2001 , health authorities now fear that people could have already consumed the drinks .
german minister to push for action german minster for consumer protection and agriculture renate künast - who came under fire recently for information lapses by her ministry in the scandal regarding cancer-causing herbicide nitrofen in german animal feed - is expected to push for the publication of an eu-wide list of permitted ingredients in animal feed at the brussels meeting .
on german television monday morning , künast said the european feed-producing industry should be controlled more effectively .
the mpa hormone in the latest food scandal is banned in the eu as scientists believe it might cause infertility in humans if taken in high doses and for long periods .
but mpa is still used by humans in birth control pills and also in hormone replacement therapy for women going through menopause .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.07.2002 german priest accused of sexual abuse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal karl lehmann has promised to take the necessary steps to remove paedophile priests from the church .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests in the catholic church hits germany , as a priest is suspended over charges of sexual abuse . the archdiocese of mainz has suspended a priest for allegedly repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old boy in the late 1980s .
according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel , the catholic priest sexually abused altar boys over a period of several years .
one victim has now stepped forward and formally accused the clergyman .
the archbishop of mainz and head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the church would investigate the allegations " quickly and intensively " .
in an official statement issued in response to the magazine article , lehmann said the church would " not refrain from taking the required consequences if necessary " .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests was sparked by the sex scandal engulfing the u.s. catholic church .
it has since ended the careers of four bishops and some 250 priests in the u.s. over similar alleged incidents .
still working on a standard procedure according to lehmann , the bishops ' conference was " thoroughly discussing " measures to prevent and deal with cases of " paedophile abnormalities " among church employees .
these would be adopted at the conference 's annual meeting in september .
" we have to ask ourselves , though , whether we need to proceed even more consistently , " lehmann said .
however , it was often difficult to clarify a case quickly and reliably .
he said adequate evidence would lead to the immediate suspension of the accused cleric , a procedure consistent with the demands of the pope and guidelines set up by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops .
" the church is in a learning process about this serious problem , as is society , " lehmann said .
more needs to be done but religious groups say the church is not doing enough .
the german grassroots organization " we are church " has accused the bishop 's conference of playing down the question of sexual abuse from priests .
it is n't sufficient to only set up criteria to deal with paedophile cases in the church , group spokesman christian weisner said .
it is demanding a central ombudsman for victims to turn to .
this office would work independently from the archdioceses , in order to ensure trustworthy help , he said .
weisner said his group welcomed cardinal lehmann 's change of position regarding paedophile priests .
in april , lehmann had not seen any necessity to look closer at possible cases in the german ranks following the us scandal .
" it 's good that lehmann now sees the need to act – i hope , he will also do something , " weisner said .
iggsm , an initiative against violence and sexual abuse of children and youth , also sharply criticized the bishop 's conference .
it said the bishops need to agree quickly on a common procedure . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the worldwide debate on paedophile priests in the catholic church hits germany , as a priest is suspended over charges of sexual abuse . the archdiocese of mainz has suspended a priest for allegedly repeatedly abusing a 14-year-old boy in the late 1980s .
according to a report in the newsweekly der spiegel , the catholic priest sexually abused altar boys over a period of several years .
one victim has now stepped forward and formally accused the clergyman .
the archbishop of mainz and head of the german bishops ' conference , cardinal karl lehmann , said the church would investigate the allegations " quickly and intensively " .
in an official statement issued in response to the magazine article , lehmann said the church would " not refrain from taking the required consequences if necessary " .
the worldwide debate on paedophile priests was sparked by the sex scandal engulfing the u.s. catholic church .
it has since ended the careers of four bishops and some 250 priests in the u.s. over similar alleged incidents .
still working on a standard procedure according to lehmann , the bishops ' conference was " thoroughly discussing " measures to prevent and deal with cases of " paedophile abnormalities " among church employees .
these would be adopted at the conference 's annual meeting in september .
" we have to ask ourselves , though , whether we need to proceed even more consistently , " lehmann said .
however , it was often difficult to clarify a case quickly and reliably .
he said adequate evidence would lead to the immediate suspension of the accused cleric , a procedure consistent with the demands of the pope and guidelines set up by the u.s. conference of catholic bishops .
" the church is in a learning process about this serious problem , as is society , " lehmann said .
more needs to be done but religious groups say the church is not doing enough .
the german grassroots organization " we are church " has accused the bishop 's conference of playing down the question of sexual abuse from priests .
it is n't sufficient to only set up criteria to deal with paedophile cases in the church , group spokesman christian weisner said .
it is demanding a central ombudsman for victims to turn to .
this office would work independently from the archdioceses , in order to ensure trustworthy help , he said .
weisner said his group welcomed cardinal lehmann 's change of position regarding paedophile priests .
in april , lehmann had not seen any necessity to look closer at possible cases in the german ranks following the us scandal .
" it 's good that lehmann now sees the need to act – i hope , he will also do something , " weisner said .
iggsm , an initiative against violence and sexual abuse of children and youth , also sharply criticized the bishop 's conference .

the molecule found in the kidney , can starve tumours by blocking their ability to supply themselves with blood by growing new vessels .
researchers believe it could be effective against a wide range of cancers , as well as other conditions such as artery disease and diabetes .
we are very excited about this - theoretically it could apply to any cancer researcher dr dave bates the molecule is a special form of a protein called vegf - vascular endothelial growth factor .
normally , vegf encourages angiogenesis , the growth of new blood vessels .
this is vital to the survival and spread of a tumour - without extra blood supplies , such rapid growth would be impossible .
usually vegf is only seen in diseased tissue .
but it also occurs in normal , healthy kidneys , where it does not seem to generate tumours .
scientists led by dr dave bates and dr steve harper at the university of bristol investigated this apparent paradox .
vegf 165b they found that the version of vegf in the kidney was different - and had precisely the reverse effect on the growth of blood vessels .
dr bates , whose work is published in the journal cancer research , said : " we are very excited about this .
theoretically it could apply to any cancer .
every cancer known uses vegf to make new blood vessels . "
the researchers said that in the kidney , something appeared to convert vegf from one form to another .
when it switched from the 165b form to the dangerous type of vegf , this provided the right environment for cancer to develop .
learning what caused the switch could lead to the design of new drugs , said dr bates .
" if you can find a drug that can switch it back , you 'll stop blood vessel growth , " he said .
other diseases he is hoping that the new version of vegf could perhaps be used directly as a treatment to inhibit the growth of blood vessels around a tumour .
the team is currently engaged in a study of the effect of the protein on prostate cancer .
they believe the protein could also combat the development of breast and lung cancer and even leukaemia .
in addition it is likely to help in the treatment of atherosclerosis - narrowing of the arteries - and diabetes .

they are meeting in brussels to discuss plans approved last week by the european commission which would cut the link between the amount of aid given to farmers and the amount of grain , milk or meat they produce .
protests by farmers angry at the proposed reforms are also expected .
this ministerial meeting is expected to be long and intense .
parts of the session will be televised , which makes it even more likely that some ministers will take a tough line , aware that their farmers back at home will expect nothing less .
the eu is already split on the proposals for reform .
countries like britain , germany and the netherlands , which want to reduce the eu 's huge agricultural budget , say change is essential .
protests other member states , led by france , want to defend what they have .
french president jacques chirac has already said he is determined that there will be no major changes to the common agricultural policy until 2006 .
the european commission approved plans last week to break the link between the financial aid farmers receive from brussels and what they produce .
the commissioner in charge of agriculture , franz fischler , also wants to cap payments to large farms and invest more money in food safety and environmentally-friendly rural development programmes .
many farmers say the plans could destroy them , and protests are expected in brussels while the meeting takes place .

the commercial showed the boy telling each of his parents that the other had taken him to the zoo .
both responded by offering to take him to the fast food chain - to the child 's obvious delight .
the advert provoked 103 complaints , including many who felt it made light of the serious issue of family break-ups .
' unhealthy ' two teachers were among those who made complaints to the television watchdog .
they said the advert set an unhelpful example to children dealing with the separation of their own parents .
some said it appeared to encourage children to lie to get what they wanted .
others were concerned it could lead to unhealthy eating habits - as the boy would eat two burger meals in one day .
obesity the itc said it understood the concerns raised about the commercial .
but it dismissed the complaints because the boy seemed to be coping well with his situation .
it is not the first time concern has been raised about the tactics used by mcdonald 's to reach children .
earlier this year mps and food groups complained when the burger chain secured a £ 1m sponsorship deal with gmtv 's children 's show diggit .
mps were concerned parents would be pestered by children wanting to go to mcdonald 's , in an age where child obesity is a growing problem .

she is now a tory backbencher : mp for maidstone and weald .
but she 's always had ambitions to write novels .
an act of treachery is ann widdecombe 's second novel and follows the success of the clematis tree about euthanasia and the calamity which befalls a family when a child becomes handicapped .
ann widdecombe spoke about her book and her change of image on breakfast .
this latest offering is the story of an affair between a teenage french girl and a nazi officer during the german occupation of paris - fairly emotional , full of love and hate .
it 's about good people behaving badly covering complex moral difficulties .
a tale of illicit love , hate , and loss in occupied france , the central character is a beautiful schoolgirl of 16 who becomes tenderly involved with a married german officer , in open defiance of her devoted family .
ann insists that , as much as the book explores a conscience-stricken love , it also focuses on the destructive force of hatred .
" the holocaust is the dark background to this novel ... there are no heroes in this story .
people behave badly and well simultaneously ... life is often like that . "
given her caricature status as a fully paid-up spinster and virgin , ann maintains she can understand romance .
but she says the characters are in no way based on her ... and also flatly denies that beneath her strict exterior that there 's an old romantic : " is ruth rendell a bit of an old murderer because she writes detective novels ?
people immediately try to deduce something about the author from the work , but all a good novel does is explore .
it says , here is a situation and a mish-mash of characters , and then , with a certain degree of control , it traces their reactions . "

westminster council will argue that mayor ken livingstone 's decision to introduce the congestion charges from next february is in breach of residents ' human rights .
they claim people living just outside the charging zone will see their streets turned into polluted rat-runs , as motorists search for routes exempt from the fee .
the council will also claim that many people will be cut off from essential services - including doctors ' surgeries , schools and shops - and that there was inadequate consultation about the scheme .
' proper debate ' westminster council , backed by the kennington association , will ask for a judicial review to stop the daily fee being imposed .

the council will claim that transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- , which is responsible for the scheme , ignored evidence that congestion charges could have significant effects on air quality .
it says the details were published in a study commissioned by tfl from halcrow fox .

" above all , we need to have a proper public transport infrastructure before a congestion charging scheme can be introduced " .
decisions mr livingstone and tfl believe they can defeat the legal challenge and have earmarked £ 2.3m to cover their fees .
they believe the congestion charge will reduce traffic to " summer school holiday levels " .
mr livingstone said : " everyone of my decisions has been looked at by barristers and subject to proper legal study .

the strong results stand in contrast to many other mobile firms around the world which are struggling to persuade customers to spend money on such functions .
south korea 's market for mobiles is , like many western countries , largely saturated .
but sk telecom is managing to sell money-spinning internet services , especially picture and ring-tone downloads , much more effectively than many firms operating in western markets .
" our earnings are better than last year because we are getting more revenue per user from internet and data services , " said company spokesman choi young chul .
2.5g subscriber boom sk telecom reported a 48 % rise in profits to 900bn won -lrb- $ 764m -rrb- during the first six months of the year .

the energy giant is the latest company to face suspicion over its accounting and business practices .

he has also raised questions about the company 's accounting practices .
the collapse of energy giant enron and the discovery of fraud at worldcom have combined to damage confidence in us business and the accountants that audit their books .

we take a very conservative approach in recognising income from tolling agreements . "
george namur claims that he was asked to come up with optimistic forecasts of future power prices to justify these deals .
the deals were part of shell 's aggressive expansion in the energy trading business .
many companies have cut back their investment , following the collapse of energy giant enron last year .
in may , shell reported a big dip in its profits in the first three months of the financial year , with the company blaming the drop in earnings on lower oil and gas prices and weak demand .

the official china daily newspaper quoted foreign ministry spokesman kong quan saying that china 's defence policy remained defensive and that the country had not taken part in any arms race .
china is a peace-loving country whose national defence policy is defensive kong quan , foreign ministry spokesman the pentagon 's annual report , which was released last friday , suggested china 's defence spending was much higher than the $ 20bn beijing officially acknowledges .
" preparing for a potential conflict in the taiwan strait is the primary driver for china 's military modernisation , " the report said .
the report was seen as significant because it was the first to question china 's commitment to a peaceful settlement with taiwan .
taiwan broke with beijing in 1949 and china still views the island as a renegade province .
deterrent china has stepped up military spending in recent years , and the report estimated the annual defence budget could be as much as $ 80bn .
most of the spending has gone towards modernising the armed forces , but some has been channelled into missile and air defence that could challenge taiwan .
chinese leaders argue that beijing has to be on guard against taiwan , for example by deploying missiles along its coastline facing the island .
they affirm that the aim is to stop the island from moving away from reunification with mainland china and towards formal independence .
it is an anxiety that has been sharpened since chen shui-bian of the historically pro-independence democratic progressive party won taiwan 's presidency more than two years ago .
the bbc 's francis markus in shanghai says this is bound to shape beijing 's reaction to the pentagon report .
one academic whose thinking broadly reflects government views on the taiwan issue said that what washington views as coerciveness , beijing regards as deterrents .
he said that although china did not intend to use force to compel taiwan into reunification , the more beijing perceived the island as moving towards formal independence , the more it would have to step up what he called " deterrent measures " . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's francis markus " economic contacts are getting closer and closer " see also : 13 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific us warns of danger to taiwan 30 apr 02 -pipe- asia-pacific timeline : us-china relations 25 jan 02 -pipe- asia-pacific q & a : taiwan 's relations with china 06 mar 01 -pipe- asia-pacific military funding reflects china 's fears 02 may 02 -pipe- asia-pacific china 's hu warns us over taiwan 11 may 02 -pipe- asia-pacific taiwan firms get china opening 09 may 02 -pipe- asia-pacific taiwan 's chen offers china talks internet links : chinese government pentagon taiwan government information office the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : s korea subway inferno toll rises us plays down n korean threat thai pm says officials peddling drugs australia refuses to lift bali warning chinese official vows to end corruption japanese emperor back to work leatherbacks ' extinct in 30 years ' new project to demine tajikistan links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

the official china daily newspaper quoted foreign ministry spokesman kong quan saying that china 's defence policy remained defensive and that the country had not taken part in any arms race . "
china is a peace-loving country whose national defence policy is defensive " kong quan , foreign ministry spokesman the pentagon 's annual report , which was released last friday , suggested china 's defence spending was much higher than the $ 20bn beijing officially acknowledges .
" preparing for a potential conflict in the taiwan strait is the primary driver for china 's military modernisation , " the report said .
the report was seen as significant because it was the first to question china 's commitment to a peaceful settlement with taiwan .
taiwan broke with beijing in 1949 and china still views the island as a renegade province .
deterrent china has stepped up military spending in recent years , and the report estimated the annual defence budget could be as much as $ 80bn .
most of the spending has gone towards modernising the armed forces , but some has been channelled into missile and air defence that could challenge taiwan .
chinese leaders argue that beijing has to be on guard against taiwan , for example by deploying missiles along its coastline facing the island .
they affirm that the aim is to stop the island from moving away from reunification with mainland china and towards formal independence .
it is an anxiety that has been sharpened since chen shui-bian of the historically pro-independence democratic progressive party won taiwan 's presidency more than two years ago .
the bbc 's francis markus in shanghai says this is bound to shape beijing 's reaction to the pentagon report .
one academic whose thinking broadly reflects government views on the taiwan issue said that what washington views as coerciveness , beijing regards as deterrents .
he said that although china did not intend to use force to compel taiwan into reunification , the more beijing perceived the island as moving towards formal independence , the more it would have to step up what he called " deterrent measures " .

from monday , homes and businesses in the selected postcodes will only get one delivery a day , with no guarantee that it will be before 9am unless a fee of up to £ 14 is paid .
consignia , which has suffered losses of more than £ 1bn , believes that it could save £ 350m a year if the scheme was introduced nationwide .
click here to watch our discussion on the changes which are being piloted .
on breakfast we talked to david beardsley who runs a small website business in plymouth , one of the pilot areas .
we also spoke to peter carr from postwatch .
david beardsley said : we are being asked to pay twice .
it is inconvenient , the early mail is crucial to small businesses who work with small margins and are dependent on prompt responses .
peter carr said : £ 14 for mail deliveries before 9am for businesses is nonsensical , the chair has expressed displeasure , the sender is the client and they are already paying .
this clumsy press release fails to highlight the merit , our post has n't changed for over 30 years .
the pilot is to test proposals that we need to eliminate the one million pound loss .
there is a wind of change , the leadership has changed .
we will se more changes .
on sunday it was confirmed that the pilot schemes would go ahead with three price bands instead of a single flat rate of £ 14 a week , as had been planned .
strong public reaction to the charge had prompted consignia to reconsider these charges .
" one of the things we have to do for our customers is we have to deliver some value .
and i think that £ 14 is a lot of money for small businesses , " allan leighton , consignia chairman said .
' common sense ' under the schemes businesses and individuals that want to receive post before 9am will now have to pay a weekly fee of either £ 5 , £ 10 or £ 14 if they get fewer than 20 letters a day .
so many costs are linked to providing daily deliveries that it is the obvious area to look at postwatch customers receiving more than 20 letters a day will receive their mail before 9am , while others will be delivered by noon .
at present the second post accounts for only 4 % of letters delivered but 20 % of the postal service 's costs .
gillian wilmot , royal mail 's managing director for mail markets , said : " royal mail is cutting costs and improving efficiency in a common sense and responsible way .
" we are balancing the needs for a reliable next day service with safeguarding an affordable service for everyone . "
' no sacred cows ' postwatch , the industry regulator has supported the pilot schemes .
chairman peter carr said : " it 's quite right for royal mail to examine every option to improve its profitability .
" there can be no sacred cows .
so many costs are linked to providing daily deliveries that it is the obvious area to look at . "
other cost-cutting measures include redundancy for more than 17,000 workers .
the pilot areas where the charges will be introduced include : crawley , west sussex bow , east london edinburgh dell sheringham , norfolk east manchester llanelli , wales newbury , berks newhaven , east sussex loughborough , leicestershire halifax , west yorkshire plymouth , devon ballymena , northern ireland thirsk , north yorkshire st helens , merseyside .
