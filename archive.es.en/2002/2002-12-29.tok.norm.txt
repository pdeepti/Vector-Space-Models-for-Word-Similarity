but then came the 2001/2002 four hills tournament in germany , which transformed hannawald from a half-known ski jumper into a legend .
at the southern german tournament , he did something no one before him had succeeded in doing : he won each of the tournament 's four jumps during the event 's 50th anniversary .
it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .

hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .

at the top of his agenda is a test drive of the new transrapid train connecting downtown shanghai with its airport .
together with premiere zhu rongji , schröder will open the much-touted stretch .
prior to their inaugural voyage , schröder will meet with the chinese leaders - including president jiang zemin and his expected successor , deputy president and communist party general secretary hu jintao .
in beijing on sunday , schröder met with the man who brought the transrapid back from the sidelines : premier zhu .
the premier , trained as an engineer , has long been fascinated by the transrapid 's magnetic levitation technology .
again and again , he has asked schröder why this " treasure " has n't been deployed in germany , where it was first developed .
after having taken a ride on a transrapid train on a test track in emsland , germany , in summer 2000 , rongji made the decision that china would help create a breakthrough for the technology .
" a beautiful future " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- left -rrb- and chinese premier zhu rongji -lrb- right -rrb- on sunday , schröder met with zhu -lrb- photo -rrb- , who raised the possibility that additional projects could be announced after their planned ride on the recently completed transrapid line on new year 's day .
zhu compared the german-chinese relationship with the high-speed train , saying , " it also wants to race ahead at 450 kilometers per hour . "
he added that the transrapid had a " beautiful future " in china .
schröder also used the opportunity to give his beijing counterparts a pat on the back , saying that chinese-german relations were " first class " and used the transrapid as an example of how advanced political and economic relations between the countries have become .
on monday morning , schröder plans to meet with chinese president jiang and his handpicked successor , hu , for political talks .
after that , he will join german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and transportation minister manfred stolpe and industry representatives early new year 's day for the opening of the world 's first commercial transrapid line .
the hi-tech train , which can zip on a magnetic cushion at speeds as high as 550 kilometers per hour , will whisk passengers along the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.64 mile -rrb- route between pudong airport and the shanghai financial district in just eight minutes .
construction of the line took less than two years and the joint german-chinese project was completed on schedule .
the chinese were aided by the german engineering firm bögel as well as 50 million euro -lrb- $ 52.2 million -rrb- in financial aid from the german government .
german engineering and industry giants siemens and thyssen-krupp constructed the trains and signaling equipment for the new route .
the entire project is expected to cost in the neighborhood of 1.3 billion euros .
more plans on drawing board for the consortium of companies promoting the transrapid , the shanghai deal was the last hope for the technology .
without the credentials of a route in the port city , the mag-lev technology would likely have disappeared back to the drawing board .
but now , the airport line is intended to prove the transrapid 's viability in around the clock operation .
following the test run this week , siemens and thyssen-krupp are hoping to close a new deal with the government to build additional transrapid routes .
however , few expect schröder will return from his state visit with a declaration of intent from the chinese to build a rumored 200 kilometer route between shanghai and the tourist resort hangzhou .
a line along the 1,250 kilometer stretch between beijing and shanghai is also under consideration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid peer steinbrück , premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia is hoping for an altogether different signal .
he 's hoping the german government , based on the project 's hopeful success in china , will provide additional subsidies for a planned transrapid project in his state - which would provide a speedy link for commuters between the cities of dortmund and düsseldorf and provide the first commercial application of the railway technology in germany .
but for the consortium backing the transrapid , a first german project is no longer as important as it once seemed .
" the prospects are good that more will be built , " siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is traveling in china with schröder , said in beijing on sunday .
after the blow of a planned route between berlin and hamburg getting cancelled by the cash-strapped government , von pierer said it was no longer necessary to have a german model route .

at the top of his agenda is a test drive of the new transrapid train connecting downtown shanghai with its airport .
together with premiere zhu rongji , schröder will open the much-touted stretch .
prior to their inaugural voyage , schröder will meet with the chinese leaders - including president jiang zemin and his expected successor , deputy president and communist party general secretary hu jintao .
in beijing on sunday , schröder met with the man who brought the transrapid back from the sidelines : premier zhu .
the premier , trained as an engineer , has long been fascinated by the transrapid 's magnetic levitation technology .
again and again , he has asked schröder why this " treasure " has n't been deployed in germany , where it was first developed .
after having taken a ride on a transrapid train on a test track in emsland , germany , in summer 2000 , rongji made the decision that china would help create a breakthrough for the technology .
" a beautiful future " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- left -rrb- and chinese premier zhu rongji -lrb- right -rrb- on sunday , schröder met with zhu -lrb- photo -rrb- , who raised the possibility that additional projects could be announced after their planned ride on the recently completed transrapid line on new year 's day .
zhu compared the german-chinese relationship with the high-speed train , saying , " it also wants to race ahead at 450 kilometers per hour . "
he added that the transrapid had a " beautiful future " in china .
schröder also used the opportunity to give his beijing counterparts a pat on the back , saying that chinese-german relations were " first class " and used the transrapid as an example of how advanced political and economic relations between the countries have become .
on monday morning , schröder plans to meet with chinese president jiang and his handpicked successor , hu , for political talks .
after that , he will join german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and transportation minister manfred stolpe and industry representatives early new year 's day for the opening of the world 's first commercial transrapid line .
the hi-tech train , which can zip on a magnetic cushion at speeds as high as 550 kilometers per hour , will whisk passengers along the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.64 mile -rrb- route between pudong airport and the shanghai financial district in just eight minutes .
construction of the line took less than two years and the joint german-chinese project was completed on schedule .
the chinese were aided by the german engineering firm bögel as well as 50 million euro -lrb- $ 52.2 million -rrb- in financial aid from the german government .
german engineering and industry giants siemens and thyssen-krupp constructed the trains and signaling equipment for the new route .
the entire project is expected to cost in the neighborhood of 1.3 billion euros .
more plans on drawing board for the consortium of companies promoting the transrapid , the shanghai deal was the last hope for the technology .
without the credentials of a route in the port city , the mag-lev technology would likely have disappeared back to the drawing board .
but now , the airport line is intended to prove the transrapid 's viability in around the clock operation .
following the test run this week , siemens and thyssen-krupp are hoping to close a new deal with the government to build additional transrapid routes .
however , few expect schröder will return from his state visit with a declaration of intent from the chinese to build a rumored 200 kilometer route between shanghai and the tourist resort hangzhou .
a line along the 1,250 kilometer stretch between beijing and shanghai is also under consideration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid peer steinbrück , premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia is hoping for an altogether different signal .
he 's hoping the german government , based on the project 's hopeful success in china , will provide additional subsidies for a planned transrapid project in his state - which would provide a speedy link for commuters between the cities of dortmund and düsseldorf and provide the first commercial application of the railway technology in germany .
but for the consortium backing the transrapid , a first german project is no longer as important as it once seemed .
" the prospects are good that more will be built , " siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is traveling in china with schröder , said in beijing on sunday .

but then came the 2001/2002 four hills tournament in germany , which transformed hannawald from a half-known ski jumper into a legend .
at the southern german tournament , he did something no one before him had succeeded in doing : he won each of the tournament 's four jumps during the event 's 50th anniversary .
it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .
and in doing so , he wrote sporting history .
hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .
and his leap to fame came with the side affects that often accompany fame : superlatives in the media , television appearances , ads , bags of fan mail , interviews , violations of his privacy , loads of money and , last but not least , numerous marriage proposals .
and on sunday , hannewald did it again , winning the opening jump of the 2002/2003 four hills event in oberstdorf .
a clear head , a clean jump but until his recent ascent , the future of the man dubbed by one german magazine as an " eagle with the angel 's face " seemed a lot less certain .
at one point he bruised his kidneys , at another he suffered a concussion .
but more than anything , he did n't seem psychologically prepared for the huge ski jumping career ahead of him .
unlike his competitors , like friend and colleague martin schmitt , some viewed hannawald as brooding , insecure and hesitant .
at times , it even appeared that the 184 centimeter tall , 60 kilogram athlete might be suffering from an acute case of anorexia .
" if he can get his head cleared , he 'll jump to victory , " his trainer , wolfgang steiert , liked to say .
and so he did : hannawald went on to win two world championships .
but his head has never been entirely clear - the single constant in his career has been his regular crash landings after high jumps .

the tabloid press speculated why he still did n't have a girlfriend .
and in his native erzgebirge region in eastern germany , people were bemused by the " winter schumacher 's " quick assimilation in his new life in western germany 's fabled black forest region , where he even picked up the local accent .
since moving , he speaks the local dialect almost as authentically as colleague schmitt , who was born there .
it may be that a southern german accent is more marketable in the world of advertising than the lilt of his native town of erlabrunn in the state of saxony .

at the top of his agenda is a test drive of the new transrapid train connecting downtown shanghai with its airport .
together with premiere zhu rongji , schröder will open the much-touted stretch .
prior to their inaugural voyage , schröder will meet with the chinese leaders - including president jiang zemin and his expected successor , deputy president and communist party general secretary hu jintao .
in beijing on sunday , schröder met with the man who brought the transrapid back from the sidelines : premier zhu .
the premier , trained as an engineer , has long been fascinated by the transrapid 's magnetic levitation technology .
again and again , he has asked schröder why this " treasure " has n't been deployed in germany , where it was first developed .
after having taken a ride on a transrapid train on a test track in emsland , germany , in summer 2000 , rongji made the decision that china would help create a breakthrough for the technology .
" a beautiful future " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- left -rrb- and chinese premier zhu rongji -lrb- right -rrb- on sunday , schröder met with zhu -lrb- photo -rrb- , who raised the possibility that additional projects could be announced after their planned ride on the recently completed transrapid line on new year 's day .
zhu compared the german-chinese relationship with the high-speed train , saying , " it also wants to race ahead at 450 kilometers per hour . "
he added that the transrapid had a " beautiful future " in china .
schröder also used the opportunity to give his beijing counterparts a pat on the back , saying that chinese-german relations were " first class " and used the transrapid as an example of how advanced political and economic relations between the countries have become .
on monday morning , schröder plans to meet with chinese president jiang and his handpicked successor , hu , for political talks .
after that , he will join german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and transportation minister manfred stolpe and industry representatives early new year 's day for the opening of the world 's first commercial transrapid line .
the hi-tech train , which can zip on a magnetic cushion at speeds as high as 550 kilometers per hour , will whisk passengers along the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.64 mile -rrb- route between pudong airport and the shanghai financial district in just eight minutes .
construction of the line took less than two years and the joint german-chinese project was completed on schedule .
the chinese were aided by the german engineering firm bögel as well as 50 million euro -lrb- $ 52.2 million -rrb- in financial aid from the german government .
german engineering and industry giants siemens and thyssen-krupp constructed the trains and signaling equipment for the new route .
the entire project is expected to cost in the neighborhood of 1.3 billion euros .
more plans on drawing board for the consortium of companies promoting the transrapid , the shanghai deal was the last hope for the technology .
without the credentials of a route in the port city , the mag-lev technology would likely have disappeared back to the drawing board .
but now , the airport line is intended to prove the transrapid 's viability in around the clock operation .
following the test run this week , siemens and thyssen-krupp are hoping to close a new deal with the government to build additional transrapid routes .
however , few expect schröder will return from his state visit with a declaration of intent from the chinese to build a rumored 200 kilometer route between shanghai and the tourist resort hangzhou .
a line along the 1,250 kilometer stretch between beijing and shanghai is also under consideration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid peer steinbrück , premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia is hoping for an altogether different signal .
he 's hoping the german government , based on the project 's hopeful success in china , will provide additional subsidies for a planned transrapid project in his state - which would provide a speedy link for commuters between the cities of dortmund and düsseldorf and provide the first commercial application of the railway technology in germany .
but for the consortium backing the transrapid , a first german project is no longer as important as it once seemed .
" the prospects are good that more will be built , " siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is traveling in china with schröder , said in beijing on sunday .
after the blow of a planned route between berlin and hamburg getting cancelled by the cash-strapped government , von pierer said it was no longer necessary to have a german model route .

prior to their inaugural voyage , schröder will meet with the chinese leaders - including president jiang zemin and his expected successor , deputy president and communist party general secretary hu jintao .
in beijing on sunday , schröder met with the man who brought the transrapid back from the sidelines : premier zhu .
the premier , trained as an engineer , has long been fascinated by the transrapid 's magnetic levitation technology .
again and again , he has asked schröder why this " treasure " has n't been deployed in germany , where it was first developed .
after having taken a ride on a transrapid train on a test track in emsland , germany , in summer 2000 , rongji made the decision that china would help create a breakthrough for the technology .
" a beautiful future " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- left -rrb- and chinese premier zhu rongji -lrb- right -rrb- on sunday , schröder met with zhu -lrb- photo -rrb- , who raised the possibility that additional projects could be announced after their planned ride on the recently completed transrapid line on new year 's day .
zhu compared the german-chinese relationship with the high-speed train , saying , " it also wants to race ahead at 450 kilometers per hour . "
he added that the transrapid had a " beautiful future " in china .
schröder also used the opportunity to give his beijing counterparts a pat on the back , saying that chinese-german relations were " first class " and used the transrapid as an example of how advanced political and economic relations between the countries have become .
on monday morning , schröder plans to meet with chinese president jiang and his handpicked successor , hu , for political talks .
after that , he will join german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and transportation minister manfred stolpe and industry representatives early new year 's day for the opening of the world 's first commercial transrapid line .
the hi-tech train , which can zip on a magnetic cushion at speeds as high as 550 kilometers per hour , will whisk passengers along the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.64 mile -rrb- route between pudong airport and the shanghai financial district in just eight minutes .
construction of the line took less than two years and the joint german-chinese project was completed on schedule .
the chinese were aided by the german engineering firm bögel as well as 50 million euro -lrb- $ 52.2 million -rrb- in financial aid from the german government .
german engineering and industry giants siemens and thyssen-krupp constructed the trains and signaling equipment for the new route .
the entire project is expected to cost in the neighborhood of 1.3 billion euros .
more plans on drawing board for the consortium of companies promoting the transrapid , the shanghai deal was the last hope for the technology .
without the credentials of a route in the port city , the mag-lev technology would likely have disappeared back to the drawing board .
but now , the airport line is intended to prove the transrapid 's viability in around the clock operation .
following the test run this week , siemens and thyssen-krupp are hoping to close a new deal with the government to build additional transrapid routes .
however , few expect schröder will return from his state visit with a declaration of intent from the chinese to build a rumored 200 kilometer route between shanghai and the tourist resort hangzhou .
a line along the 1,250 kilometer stretch between beijing and shanghai is also under consideration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid peer steinbrück , premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia is hoping for an altogether different signal .
he 's hoping the german government , based on the project 's hopeful success in china , will provide additional subsidies for a planned transrapid project in his state - which would provide a speedy link for commuters between the cities of dortmund and düsseldorf and provide the first commercial application of the railway technology in germany .
but for the consortium backing the transrapid , a first german project is no longer as important as it once seemed .
" the prospects are good that more will be built , " siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is traveling in china with schröder , said in beijing on sunday .
after the blow of a planned route between berlin and hamburg getting cancelled by the cash-strapped government , von pierer said it was no longer necessary to have a german model route .
" they can also be built in china , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and china celebrate 30 years of ties oct .

but then came the 2001/2002 four hills tournament in germany , which transformed hannawald from a half-known ski jumper into a legend .
at the southern german tournament , he did something no one before him had succeeded in doing : he won each of the tournament 's four jumps during the event 's 50th anniversary .
it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .
and in doing so , he wrote sporting history .
hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .
and his leap to fame came with the side affects that often accompany fame : superlatives in the media , television appearances , ads , bags of fan mail , interviews , violations of his privacy , loads of money and , last but not least , numerous marriage proposals .
and on sunday , hannewald did it again , winning the opening jump of the 2002/2003 four hills event in oberstdorf .
a clear head , a clean jump but until his recent ascent , the future of the man dubbed by one german magazine as an " eagle with the angel 's face " seemed a lot less certain .
at one point he bruised his kidneys , at another he suffered a concussion .
but more than anything , he did n't seem psychologically prepared for the huge ski jumping career ahead of him .
unlike his competitors , like friend and colleague martin schmitt , some viewed hannawald as brooding , insecure and hesitant .
at times , it even appeared that the 184 centimeter tall , 60 kilogram athlete might be suffering from an acute case of anorexia .
" if he can get his head cleared , he 'll jump to victory , " his trainer , wolfgang steiert , liked to say .
and so he did : hannawald went on to win two world championships .
but his head has never been entirely clear - the single constant in his career has been his regular crash landings after high jumps .

and in his native erzgebirge region in eastern germany , people were bemused by the " winter schumacher 's " quick assimilation in his new life in western germany 's fabled black forest region , where he even picked up the local accent .
since moving , he speaks the local dialect almost as authentically as colleague schmitt , who was born there .
it may be that a southern german accent is more marketable in the world of advertising than the lilt of his native town of erlabrunn in the state of saxony .
after all , a saxon accent did n't help his predecessors any .
take , for example , the case of jens weissflog , another famous ski jumper whose saxon accent is believed to have squashed his chances at a successful career in the world of advertising and corporate sponsorship .
speaking roles in spots for weissflog were unthinkable .
a breakdown of the system the next crash came at the start of this year 's world cup season .
at the first world cup qualifying round in kuusamo , finland , hannawald did n't even place within the top 30 in two rounds .

zhu compared the german-chinese relationship with the high-speed train , saying , " it also wants to race ahead at 450 kilometers per hour . "
he added that the transrapid had a " beautiful future " in china .
schröder also used the opportunity to give his beijing counterparts a pat on the back , saying that chinese-german relations were " first class " and used the transrapid as an example of how advanced political and economic relations between the countries have become .
on monday morning , schröder plans to meet with chinese president jiang and his handpicked successor , hu , for political talks .
after that , he will join german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and transportation minister manfred stolpe and industry representatives early new year 's day for the opening of the world 's first commercial transrapid line .

construction of the line took less than two years and the joint german-chinese project was completed on schedule .
the chinese were aided by the german engineering firm bögel as well as 50 million euro -lrb- $ 52.2 million -rrb- in financial aid from the german government .
german engineering and industry giants siemens and thyssen-krupp constructed the trains and signaling equipment for the new route .
the entire project is expected to cost in the neighborhood of 1.3 billion euros .

without the credentials of a route in the port city , the mag-lev technology would likely have disappeared back to the drawing board .
but now , the airport line is intended to prove the transrapid 's viability in around the clock operation .
following the test run this week , siemens and thyssen-krupp are hoping to close a new deal with the government to build additional transrapid routes .
however , few expect schröder will return from his state visit with a declaration of intent from the chinese to build a rumored 200 kilometer route between shanghai and the tourist resort hangzhou .

but then came the 2001/2002 four hills tournament in germany , which transformed hannawald from a half-known ski jumper into a legend .
at the southern german tournament , he did something no one before him had succeeded in doing : he won each of the tournament 's four jumps during the event 's 50th anniversary .
it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .
and in doing so , he wrote sporting history .
hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .
and his leap to fame came with the side affects that often accompany fame : superlatives in the media , television appearances , ads , bags of fan mail , interviews , violations of his privacy , loads of money and , last but not least , numerous marriage proposals .
and on sunday , hannewald did it again , winning the opening jump of the 2002/2003 four hills event in oberstdorf .
a clear head , a clean jump but until his recent ascent , the future of the man dubbed by one german magazine as an " eagle with the angel 's face " seemed a lot less certain .
at one point he bruised his kidneys , at another he suffered a concussion .
but more than anything , he did n't seem psychologically prepared for the huge ski jumping career ahead of him .
unlike his competitors , like friend and colleague martin schmitt , some viewed hannawald as brooding , insecure and hesitant .
at times , it even appeared that the 184 centimeter tall , 60 kilogram athlete might be suffering from an acute case of anorexia .
" if he can get his head cleared , he 'll jump to victory , " his trainer , wolfgang steiert , liked to say .
and so he did : hannawald went on to win two world championships .
but his head has never been entirely clear - the single constant in his career has been his regular crash landings after high jumps .
a ski jumping sex bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald but the negative buzz around hannawald quieted after his historic jumps at this year 's four hills tournament .
instead , the focus shifted to hannawald the advertising commodity or hannawald the heartthrob -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the tabloid press speculated why he still did n't have a girlfriend .
and in his native erzgebirge region in eastern germany , people were bemused by the " winter schumacher 's " quick assimilation in his new life in western germany 's fabled black forest region , where he even picked up the local accent .
since moving , he speaks the local dialect almost as authentically as colleague schmitt , who was born there .
it may be that a southern german accent is more marketable in the world of advertising than the lilt of his native town of erlabrunn in the state of saxony .
after all , a saxon accent did n't help his predecessors any .
take , for example , the case of jens weissflog , another famous ski jumper whose saxon accent is believed to have squashed his chances at a successful career in the world of advertising and corporate sponsorship .
speaking roles in spots for weissflog were unthinkable .
a breakdown of the system the next crash came at the start of this year 's world cup season .
at the first world cup qualifying round in kuusamo , finland , hannawald did n't even place within the top 30 in two rounds .
trainer steiert , whom hannawald has affectionately called his " second father , " had plenty of excuses - temperatures of minus 25 degrees celsius , wind , his skies , a knee operation hannawald underwent last summer .
whatever the case may be , hannawald 's " flight system collapsed , " steiert said .
hannawald went into retreat , took a break from competition and began training more intensively .
now , hannawald is back for this year 's four hills tournament .
just before christmas he won world cup qualifying at engelberg and was selected as athlete of the year 2002 .
the timing could n't have been better .
sponsors , fans and television broadcasters should all be pleased .
with a considerable amount of help from the very marketable hannawald , private broadcaster rtl has managed to transform the once overlooked sport of ski jumping into germany 's no. 3 television sporting event , falling just behind soccer and formula one racing .
and high ratings are expected as hannawald hits the ramp this year .
this one 's for the fans but few believe he can repeat his historical performance - not even hannawald himself .
" i want to offer viewers something so that they do n't waste their time tuning into ski jumping , " he says .
and you can take his word for it .

but then came the 2001/2002 four hills tournament in germany , which transformed hannawald from a half-known ski jumper into a legend .
at the southern german tournament , he did something no one before him had succeeded in doing : he won each of the tournament 's four jumps during the event 's 50th anniversary .
it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .
and in doing so , he wrote sporting history .
hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .
and his leap to fame came with the side affects that often accompany fame : superlatives in the media , television appearances , ads , bags of fan mail , interviews , violations of his privacy , loads of money and , last but not least , numerous marriage proposals .
and on sunday , hannewald did it again , winning the opening jump of the 2002/2003 four hills event in oberstdorf .
a clear head , a clean jump but until his recent ascent , the future of the man dubbed by one german magazine as an " eagle with the angel 's face " seemed a lot less certain .
at one point he bruised his kidneys , at another he suffered a concussion .
but more than anything , he did n't seem psychologically prepared for the huge ski jumping career ahead of him .
unlike his competitors , like friend and colleague martin schmitt , some viewed hannawald as brooding , insecure and hesitant .
at times , it even appeared that the 184 centimeter tall , 60 kilogram athlete might be suffering from an acute case of anorexia .

but then came the 2001/2002 four hills tournament in germany , which transformed hannawald from a half-known ski jumper into a legend .
at the southern german tournament , he did something no one before him had succeeded in doing : he won each of the tournament 's four jumps during the event 's 50th anniversary .
it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .
and in doing so , he wrote sporting history .
hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .
and his leap to fame came with the side affects that often accompany fame : superlatives in the media , television appearances , ads , bags of fan mail , interviews , violations of his privacy , loads of money and , last but not least , numerous marriage proposals .
and on sunday , hannewald did it again , winning the opening jump of the 2002/2003 four hills event in oberstdorf .
a clear head , a clean jump but until his recent ascent , the future of the man dubbed by one german magazine as an " eagle with the angel 's face " seemed a lot less certain .
at one point he bruised his kidneys , at another he suffered a concussion .
but more than anything , he did n't seem psychologically prepared for the huge ski jumping career ahead of him .
unlike his competitors , like friend and colleague martin schmitt , some viewed hannawald as brooding , insecure and hesitant .
at times , it even appeared that the 184 centimeter tall , 60 kilogram athlete might be suffering from an acute case of anorexia .

just before christmas he won world cup qualifying at engelberg and was selected as athlete of the year 2002 .
the timing could n't have been better .
sponsors , fans and television broadcasters should all be pleased .
with a considerable amount of help from the very marketable hannawald , private broadcaster rtl has managed to transform the once overlooked sport of ski jumping into germany 's no. 3 television sporting event , falling just behind soccer and formula one racing .
and high ratings are expected as hannawald hits the ramp this year .
this one 's for the fans but few believe he can repeat his historical performance - not even hannawald himself .
" i want to offer viewers something so that they do n't waste their time tuning into ski jumping , " he says .
and you can take his word for it .
for viewers are allowed to expect whatever they want from hannawald - but there 's one thing he can guarantee they wo n't get - and that 's bored . oliver samson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dominating the snow and ice 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

at the top of his agenda is a test drive of the new transrapid train connecting downtown shanghai with its airport .
together with premiere zhu rongji , schröder will open the much-touted stretch .
prior to their inaugural voyage , schröder will meet with the chinese leaders - including president jiang zemin and his expected successor , deputy president and communist party general secretary hu jintao .
in beijing on sunday , schröder met with the man who brought the transrapid back from the sidelines : premier zhu .
the premier , trained as an engineer , has long been fascinated by the transrapid 's magnetic levitation technology .
again and again , he has asked schröder why this " treasure " has n't been deployed in germany , where it was first developed .
after having taken a ride on a transrapid train on a test track in emsland , germany , in summer 2000 , rongji made the decision that china would help create a breakthrough for the technology .

zhu compared the german-chinese relationship with the high-speed train , saying , " it also wants to race ahead at 450 kilometers per hour . "
he added that the transrapid had a " beautiful future " in china .
schröder also used the opportunity to give his beijing counterparts a pat on the back , saying that chinese-german relations were " first class " and used the transrapid as an example of how advanced political and economic relations between the countries have become .
on monday morning , schröder plans to meet with chinese president jiang and his handpicked successor , hu , for political talks .
after that , he will join german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and transportation minister manfred stolpe and industry representatives early new year 's day for the opening of the world 's first commercial transrapid line .
the hi-tech train , which can zip on a magnetic cushion at speeds as high as 550 kilometers per hour , will whisk passengers along the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.64 mile -rrb- route between pudong airport and the shanghai financial district in just eight minutes .
construction of the line took less than two years and the joint german-chinese project was completed on schedule .
the chinese were aided by the german engineering firm bögel as well as 50 million euro -lrb- $ 52.2 million -rrb- in financial aid from the german government .
german engineering and industry giants siemens and thyssen-krupp constructed the trains and signaling equipment for the new route .
the entire project is expected to cost in the neighborhood of 1.3 billion euros .
more plans on drawing board for the consortium of companies promoting the transrapid , the shanghai deal was the last hope for the technology .
without the credentials of a route in the port city , the mag-lev technology would likely have disappeared back to the drawing board .
but now , the airport line is intended to prove the transrapid 's viability in around the clock operation .
following the test run this week , siemens and thyssen-krupp are hoping to close a new deal with the government to build additional transrapid routes .
however , few expect schröder will return from his state visit with a declaration of intent from the chinese to build a rumored 200 kilometer route between shanghai and the tourist resort hangzhou .
a line along the 1,250 kilometer stretch between beijing and shanghai is also under consideration .

at the top of his agenda is a test drive of the new transrapid train connecting downtown shanghai with its airport .
together with premiere zhu rongji , schröder will open the much-touted stretch .
prior to their inaugural voyage , schröder will meet with the chinese leaders - including president jiang zemin and his expected successor , deputy president and communist party general secretary hu jintao .
in beijing on sunday , schröder met with the man who brought the transrapid back from the sidelines : premier zhu .
the premier , trained as an engineer , has long been fascinated by the transrapid 's magnetic levitation technology .
again and again , he has asked schröder why this " treasure " has n't been deployed in germany , where it was first developed .
after having taken a ride on a transrapid train on a test track in emsland , germany , in summer 2000 , rongji made the decision that china would help create a breakthrough for the technology .
" a beautiful future " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- left -rrb- and chinese premier zhu rongji -lrb- right -rrb- on sunday , schröder met with zhu -lrb- photo -rrb- , who raised the possibility that additional projects could be announced after their planned ride on the recently completed transrapid line on new year 's day .
zhu compared the german-chinese relationship with the high-speed train , saying , " it also wants to race ahead at 450 kilometers per hour . "
he added that the transrapid had a " beautiful future " in china .
schröder also used the opportunity to give his beijing counterparts a pat on the back , saying that chinese-german relations were " first class " and used the transrapid as an example of how advanced political and economic relations between the countries have become .
on monday morning , schröder plans to meet with chinese president jiang and his handpicked successor , hu , for political talks .
after that , he will join german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and transportation minister manfred stolpe and industry representatives early new year 's day for the opening of the world 's first commercial transrapid line .
the hi-tech train , which can zip on a magnetic cushion at speeds as high as 550 kilometers per hour , will whisk passengers along the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.64 mile -rrb- route between pudong airport and the shanghai financial district in just eight minutes .
construction of the line took less than two years and the joint german-chinese project was completed on schedule .
the chinese were aided by the german engineering firm bögel as well as 50 million euro -lrb- $ 52.2 million -rrb- in financial aid from the german government .
german engineering and industry giants siemens and thyssen-krupp constructed the trains and signaling equipment for the new route .
the entire project is expected to cost in the neighborhood of 1.3 billion euros .
more plans on drawing board for the consortium of companies promoting the transrapid , the shanghai deal was the last hope for the technology .
without the credentials of a route in the port city , the mag-lev technology would likely have disappeared back to the drawing board .
but now , the airport line is intended to prove the transrapid 's viability in around the clock operation .
following the test run this week , siemens and thyssen-krupp are hoping to close a new deal with the government to build additional transrapid routes .
however , few expect schröder will return from his state visit with a declaration of intent from the chinese to build a rumored 200 kilometer route between shanghai and the tourist resort hangzhou .
a line along the 1,250 kilometer stretch between beijing and shanghai is also under consideration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid peer steinbrück , premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia is hoping for an altogether different signal .
he 's hoping the german government , based on the project 's hopeful success in china , will provide additional subsidies for a planned transrapid project in his state - which would provide a speedy link for commuters between the cities of dortmund and düsseldorf and provide the first commercial application of the railway technology in germany .
but for the consortium backing the transrapid , a first german project is no longer as important as it once seemed .
" the prospects are good that more will be built , " siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is traveling in china with schröder , said in beijing on sunday .
after the blow of a planned route between berlin and hamburg getting cancelled by the cash-strapped government , von pierer said it was no longer necessary to have a german model route .
" they can also be built in china , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and china celebrate 30 years of ties oct .

but then came the 2001/2002 four hills tournament in germany , which transformed hannawald from a half-known ski jumper into a legend .
at the southern german tournament , he did something no one before him had succeeded in doing : he won each of the tournament 's four jumps during the event 's 50th anniversary .
it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .
and in doing so , he wrote sporting history .
hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .
and his leap to fame came with the side affects that often accompany fame : superlatives in the media , television appearances , ads , bags of fan mail , interviews , violations of his privacy , loads of money and , last but not least , numerous marriage proposals .
and on sunday , hannewald did it again , winning the opening jump of the 2002/2003 four hills event in oberstdorf .
a clear head , a clean jump but until his recent ascent , the future of the man dubbed by one german magazine as an " eagle with the angel 's face " seemed a lot less certain .
at one point he bruised his kidneys , at another he suffered a concussion .
but more than anything , he did n't seem psychologically prepared for the huge ski jumping career ahead of him .
unlike his competitors , like friend and colleague martin schmitt , some viewed hannawald as brooding , insecure and hesitant .
at times , it even appeared that the 184 centimeter tall , 60 kilogram athlete might be suffering from an acute case of anorexia .
" if he can get his head cleared , he 'll jump to victory , " his trainer , wolfgang steiert , liked to say .
and so he did : hannawald went on to win two world championships .
but his head has never been entirely clear - the single constant in his career has been his regular crash landings after high jumps .
a ski jumping sex bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald but the negative buzz around hannawald quieted after his historic jumps at this year 's four hills tournament .
instead , the focus shifted to hannawald the advertising commodity or hannawald the heartthrob -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the tabloid press speculated why he still did n't have a girlfriend .
and in his native erzgebirge region in eastern germany , people were bemused by the " winter schumacher 's " quick assimilation in his new life in western germany 's fabled black forest region , where he even picked up the local accent .
since moving , he speaks the local dialect almost as authentically as colleague schmitt , who was born there .
it may be that a southern german accent is more marketable in the world of advertising than the lilt of his native town of erlabrunn in the state of saxony .
after all , a saxon accent did n't help his predecessors any .
take , for example , the case of jens weissflog , another famous ski jumper whose saxon accent is believed to have squashed his chances at a successful career in the world of advertising and corporate sponsorship .
speaking roles in spots for weissflog were unthinkable .
a breakdown of the system the next crash came at the start of this year 's world cup season .
at the first world cup qualifying round in kuusamo , finland , hannawald did n't even place within the top 30 in two rounds .
trainer steiert , whom hannawald has affectionately called his " second father , " had plenty of excuses - temperatures of minus 25 degrees celsius , wind , his skies , a knee operation hannawald underwent last summer .
whatever the case may be , hannawald 's " flight system collapsed , " steiert said .
hannawald went into retreat , took a break from competition and began training more intensively .
now , hannawald is back for this year 's four hills tournament .
just before christmas he won world cup qualifying at engelberg and was selected as athlete of the year 2002 .
the timing could n't have been better .
sponsors , fans and television broadcasters should all be pleased .
with a considerable amount of help from the very marketable hannawald , private broadcaster rtl has managed to transform the once overlooked sport of ski jumping into germany 's no. 3 television sporting event , falling just behind soccer and formula one racing .
and high ratings are expected as hannawald hits the ramp this year .
this one 's for the fans but few believe he can repeat his historical performance - not even hannawald himself .

but then came the 2001/2002 four hills tournament in germany , which transformed hannawald from a half-known ski jumper into a legend .
at the southern german tournament , he did something no one before him had succeeded in doing : he won each of the tournament 's four jumps during the event 's 50th anniversary .
it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .
and in doing so , he wrote sporting history .
hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .
and his leap to fame came with the side affects that often accompany fame : superlatives in the media , television appearances , ads , bags of fan mail , interviews , violations of his privacy , loads of money and , last but not least , numerous marriage proposals .
and on sunday , hannewald did it again , winning the opening jump of the 2002/2003 four hills event in oberstdorf .
a clear head , a clean jump but until his recent ascent , the future of the man dubbed by one german magazine as an " eagle with the angel 's face " seemed a lot less certain .
at one point he bruised his kidneys , at another he suffered a concussion .
but more than anything , he did n't seem psychologically prepared for the huge ski jumping career ahead of him .
unlike his competitors , like friend and colleague martin schmitt , some viewed hannawald as brooding , insecure and hesitant .
at times , it even appeared that the 184 centimeter tall , 60 kilogram athlete might be suffering from an acute case of anorexia .
" if he can get his head cleared , he 'll jump to victory , " his trainer , wolfgang steiert , liked to say .
and so he did : hannawald went on to win two world championships .
but his head has never been entirely clear - the single constant in his career has been his regular crash landings after high jumps .
a ski jumping sex bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald but the negative buzz around hannawald quieted after his historic jumps at this year 's four hills tournament .
instead , the focus shifted to hannawald the advertising commodity or hannawald the heartthrob -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the tabloid press speculated why he still did n't have a girlfriend .
and in his native erzgebirge region in eastern germany , people were bemused by the " winter schumacher 's " quick assimilation in his new life in western germany 's fabled black forest region , where he even picked up the local accent .
since moving , he speaks the local dialect almost as authentically as colleague schmitt , who was born there .
it may be that a southern german accent is more marketable in the world of advertising than the lilt of his native town of erlabrunn in the state of saxony .
after all , a saxon accent did n't help his predecessors any .
take , for example , the case of jens weissflog , another famous ski jumper whose saxon accent is believed to have squashed his chances at a successful career in the world of advertising and corporate sponsorship .
speaking roles in spots for weissflog were unthinkable .
a breakdown of the system the next crash came at the start of this year 's world cup season .
at the first world cup qualifying round in kuusamo , finland , hannawald did n't even place within the top 30 in two rounds .
trainer steiert , whom hannawald has affectionately called his " second father , " had plenty of excuses - temperatures of minus 25 degrees celsius , wind , his skies , a knee operation hannawald underwent last summer .
whatever the case may be , hannawald 's " flight system collapsed , " steiert said .
hannawald went into retreat , took a break from competition and began training more intensively .
now , hannawald is back for this year 's four hills tournament .
just before christmas he won world cup qualifying at engelberg and was selected as athlete of the year 2002 .
the timing could n't have been better .
sponsors , fans and television broadcasters should all be pleased .
with a considerable amount of help from the very marketable hannawald , private broadcaster rtl has managed to transform the once overlooked sport of ski jumping into germany 's no. 3 television sporting event , falling just behind soccer and formula one racing .
and high ratings are expected as hannawald hits the ramp this year .
this one 's for the fans but few believe he can repeat his historical performance - not even hannawald himself .
" i want to offer viewers something so that they do n't waste their time tuning into ski jumping , " he says .
and you can take his word for it .
for viewers are allowed to expect whatever they want from hannawald - but there 's one thing he can guarantee they wo n't get - and that 's bored . oliver samson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dominating the snow and ice 9797 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

at the top of his agenda is a test drive of the new transrapid train connecting downtown shanghai with its airport .
together with premiere zhu rongji , schröder will open the much-touted stretch .
prior to their inaugural voyage , schröder will meet with the chinese leaders - including president jiang zemin and his expected successor , deputy president and communist party general secretary hu jintao .
in beijing on sunday , schröder met with the man who brought the transrapid back from the sidelines : premier zhu .
the premier , trained as an engineer , has long been fascinated by the transrapid 's magnetic levitation technology .
again and again , he has asked schröder why this " treasure " has n't been deployed in germany , where it was first developed .
after having taken a ride on a transrapid train on a test track in emsland , germany , in summer 2000 , rongji made the decision that china would help create a breakthrough for the technology .
" a beautiful future " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- left -rrb- and chinese premier zhu rongji -lrb- right -rrb- on sunday , schröder met with zhu -lrb- photo -rrb- , who raised the possibility that additional projects could be announced after their planned ride on the recently completed transrapid line on new year 's day .
zhu compared the german-chinese relationship with the high-speed train , saying , " it also wants to race ahead at 450 kilometers per hour . "
he added that the transrapid had a " beautiful future " in china .
schröder also used the opportunity to give his beijing counterparts a pat on the back , saying that chinese-german relations were " first class " and used the transrapid as an example of how advanced political and economic relations between the countries have become .
on monday morning , schröder plans to meet with chinese president jiang and his handpicked successor , hu , for political talks .
after that , he will join german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and transportation minister manfred stolpe and industry representatives early new year 's day for the opening of the world 's first commercial transrapid line .
the hi-tech train , which can zip on a magnetic cushion at speeds as high as 550 kilometers per hour , will whisk passengers along the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.64 mile -rrb- route between pudong airport and the shanghai financial district in just eight minutes .
construction of the line took less than two years and the joint german-chinese project was completed on schedule .
the chinese were aided by the german engineering firm bögel as well as 50 million euro -lrb- $ 52.2 million -rrb- in financial aid from the german government .
german engineering and industry giants siemens and thyssen-krupp constructed the trains and signaling equipment for the new route .
the entire project is expected to cost in the neighborhood of 1.3 billion euros .
more plans on drawing board for the consortium of companies promoting the transrapid , the shanghai deal was the last hope for the technology .
without the credentials of a route in the port city , the mag-lev technology would likely have disappeared back to the drawing board .
but now , the airport line is intended to prove the transrapid 's viability in around the clock operation .
following the test run this week , siemens and thyssen-krupp are hoping to close a new deal with the government to build additional transrapid routes .
however , few expect schröder will return from his state visit with a declaration of intent from the chinese to build a rumored 200 kilometer route between shanghai and the tourist resort hangzhou .
a line along the 1,250 kilometer stretch between beijing and shanghai is also under consideration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid peer steinbrück , premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia is hoping for an altogether different signal .
he 's hoping the german government , based on the project 's hopeful success in china , will provide additional subsidies for a planned transrapid project in his state - which would provide a speedy link for commuters between the cities of dortmund and düsseldorf and provide the first commercial application of the railway technology in germany .
but for the consortium backing the transrapid , a first german project is no longer as important as it once seemed .
" the prospects are good that more will be built , " siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is traveling in china with schröder , said in beijing on sunday .

prior to their inaugural voyage , schröder will meet with the chinese leaders - including president jiang zemin and his expected successor , deputy president and communist party general secretary hu jintao .
in beijing on sunday , schröder met with the man who brought the transrapid back from the sidelines : premier zhu .
the premier , trained as an engineer , has long been fascinated by the transrapid 's magnetic levitation technology .
again and again , he has asked schröder why this " treasure " has n't been deployed in germany , where it was first developed .

zhu compared the german-chinese relationship with the high-speed train , saying , " it also wants to race ahead at 450 kilometers per hour . "
he added that the transrapid had a " beautiful future " in china .
schröder also used the opportunity to give his beijing counterparts a pat on the back , saying that chinese-german relations were " first class " and used the transrapid as an example of how advanced political and economic relations between the countries have become .
on monday morning , schröder plans to meet with chinese president jiang and his handpicked successor , hu , for political talks .

construction of the line took less than two years and the joint german-chinese project was completed on schedule .
the chinese were aided by the german engineering firm bögel as well as 50 million euro -lrb- $ 52.2 million -rrb- in financial aid from the german government .

but then came the 2001/2002 four hills tournament in germany , which transformed hannawald from a half-known ski jumper into a legend .
at the southern german tournament , he did something no one before him had succeeded in doing : he won each of the tournament 's four jumps during the event 's 50th anniversary .
it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .
and in doing so , he wrote sporting history .
hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .
and his leap to fame came with the side affects that often accompany fame : superlatives in the media , television appearances , ads , bags of fan mail , interviews , violations of his privacy , loads of money and , last but not least , numerous marriage proposals .
and on sunday , hannewald did it again , winning the opening jump of the 2002/2003 four hills event in oberstdorf .
a clear head , a clean jump but until his recent ascent , the future of the man dubbed by one german magazine as an " eagle with the angel 's face " seemed a lot less certain .
at one point he bruised his kidneys , at another he suffered a concussion .
but more than anything , he did n't seem psychologically prepared for the huge ski jumping career ahead of him .
unlike his competitors , like friend and colleague martin schmitt , some viewed hannawald as brooding , insecure and hesitant .
at times , it even appeared that the 184 centimeter tall , 60 kilogram athlete might be suffering from an acute case of anorexia .
" if he can get his head cleared , he 'll jump to victory , " his trainer , wolfgang steiert , liked to say .
and so he did : hannawald went on to win two world championships .
but his head has never been entirely clear - the single constant in his career has been his regular crash landings after high jumps .
a ski jumping sex bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald but the negative buzz around hannawald quieted after his historic jumps at this year 's four hills tournament .
instead , the focus shifted to hannawald the advertising commodity or hannawald the heartthrob -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the tabloid press speculated why he still did n't have a girlfriend .
and in his native erzgebirge region in eastern germany , people were bemused by the " winter schumacher 's " quick assimilation in his new life in western germany 's fabled black forest region , where he even picked up the local accent .
since moving , he speaks the local dialect almost as authentically as colleague schmitt , who was born there .
it may be that a southern german accent is more marketable in the world of advertising than the lilt of his native town of erlabrunn in the state of saxony .
after all , a saxon accent did n't help his predecessors any .
take , for example , the case of jens weissflog , another famous ski jumper whose saxon accent is believed to have squashed his chances at a successful career in the world of advertising and corporate sponsorship .
speaking roles in spots for weissflog were unthinkable .
a breakdown of the system the next crash came at the start of this year 's world cup season .
at the first world cup qualifying round in kuusamo , finland , hannawald did n't even place within the top 30 in two rounds .
trainer steiert , whom hannawald has affectionately called his " second father , " had plenty of excuses - temperatures of minus 25 degrees celsius , wind , his skies , a knee operation hannawald underwent last summer .
whatever the case may be , hannawald 's " flight system collapsed , " steiert said .
hannawald went into retreat , took a break from competition and began training more intensively .
now , hannawald is back for this year 's four hills tournament .
just before christmas he won world cup qualifying at engelberg and was selected as athlete of the year 2002 .
the timing could n't have been better .
sponsors , fans and television broadcasters should all be pleased .
with a considerable amount of help from the very marketable hannawald , private broadcaster rtl has managed to transform the once overlooked sport of ski jumping into germany 's no. 3 television sporting event , falling just behind soccer and formula one racing .
and high ratings are expected as hannawald hits the ramp this year .
this one 's for the fans but few believe he can repeat his historical performance - not even hannawald himself .
" i want to offer viewers something so that they do n't waste their time tuning into ski jumping , " he says .
and you can take his word for it .
for viewers are allowed to expect whatever they want from hannawald - but there 's one thing he can guarantee they wo n't get - and that 's bored . oliver samson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dominating the snow and ice 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

at the top of his agenda is a test drive of the new transrapid train connecting downtown shanghai with its airport .
together with premiere zhu rongji , schröder will open the much-touted stretch .
prior to their inaugural voyage , schröder will meet with the chinese leaders - including president jiang zemin and his expected successor , deputy president and communist party general secretary hu jintao .
in beijing on sunday , schröder met with the man who brought the transrapid back from the sidelines : premier zhu .
the premier , trained as an engineer , has long been fascinated by the transrapid 's magnetic levitation technology .
again and again , he has asked schröder why this " treasure " has n't been deployed in germany , where it was first developed .
after having taken a ride on a transrapid train on a test track in emsland , germany , in summer 2000 , rongji made the decision that china would help create a breakthrough for the technology .
" a beautiful future " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- left -rrb- and chinese premier zhu rongji -lrb- right -rrb- on sunday , schröder met with zhu -lrb- photo -rrb- , who raised the possibility that additional projects could be announced after their planned ride on the recently completed transrapid line on new year 's day .
zhu compared the german-chinese relationship with the high-speed train , saying , " it also wants to race ahead at 450 kilometers per hour . "
he added that the transrapid had a " beautiful future " in china .
schröder also used the opportunity to give his beijing counterparts a pat on the back , saying that chinese-german relations were " first class " and used the transrapid as an example of how advanced political and economic relations between the countries have become .
on monday morning , schröder plans to meet with chinese president jiang and his handpicked successor , hu , for political talks .
after that , he will join german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and transportation minister manfred stolpe and industry representatives early new year 's day for the opening of the world 's first commercial transrapid line .
the hi-tech train , which can zip on a magnetic cushion at speeds as high as 550 kilometers per hour , will whisk passengers along the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.64 mile -rrb- route between pudong airport and the shanghai financial district in just eight minutes .
construction of the line took less than two years and the joint german-chinese project was completed on schedule .
the chinese were aided by the german engineering firm bögel as well as 50 million euro -lrb- $ 52.2 million -rrb- in financial aid from the german government .
german engineering and industry giants siemens and thyssen-krupp constructed the trains and signaling equipment for the new route .
the entire project is expected to cost in the neighborhood of 1.3 billion euros .
more plans on drawing board for the consortium of companies promoting the transrapid , the shanghai deal was the last hope for the technology .
without the credentials of a route in the port city , the mag-lev technology would likely have disappeared back to the drawing board .
but now , the airport line is intended to prove the transrapid 's viability in around the clock operation .
following the test run this week , siemens and thyssen-krupp are hoping to close a new deal with the government to build additional transrapid routes .
however , few expect schröder will return from his state visit with a declaration of intent from the chinese to build a rumored 200 kilometer route between shanghai and the tourist resort hangzhou .
a line along the 1,250 kilometer stretch between beijing and shanghai is also under consideration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid peer steinbrück , premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia is hoping for an altogether different signal .
he 's hoping the german government , based on the project 's hopeful success in china , will provide additional subsidies for a planned transrapid project in his state - which would provide a speedy link for commuters between the cities of dortmund and düsseldorf and provide the first commercial application of the railway technology in germany .
but for the consortium backing the transrapid , a first german project is no longer as important as it once seemed .
" the prospects are good that more will be built , " siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is traveling in china with schröder , said in beijing on sunday .
after the blow of a planned route between berlin and hamburg getting cancelled by the cash-strapped government , von pierer said it was no longer necessary to have a german model route .
" they can also be built in china , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and china celebrate 30 years of ties oct .

but then came the 2001/2002 four hills tournament in germany , which transformed hannawald from a half-known ski jumper into a legend .
at the southern german tournament , he did something no one before him had succeeded in doing : he won each of the tournament 's four jumps during the event 's 50th anniversary .
it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .
and in doing so , he wrote sporting history .
hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .
and his leap to fame came with the side affects that often accompany fame : superlatives in the media , television appearances , ads , bags of fan mail , interviews , violations of his privacy , loads of money and , last but not least , numerous marriage proposals .
and on sunday , hannewald did it again , winning the opening jump of the 2002/2003 four hills event in oberstdorf .
a clear head , a clean jump but until his recent ascent , the future of the man dubbed by one german magazine as an " eagle with the angel 's face " seemed a lot less certain .
at one point he bruised his kidneys , at another he suffered a concussion .
but more than anything , he did n't seem psychologically prepared for the huge ski jumping career ahead of him .
unlike his competitors , like friend and colleague martin schmitt , some viewed hannawald as brooding , insecure and hesitant .
at times , it even appeared that the 184 centimeter tall , 60 kilogram athlete might be suffering from an acute case of anorexia .
" if he can get his head cleared , he 'll jump to victory , " his trainer , wolfgang steiert , liked to say .
and so he did : hannawald went on to win two world championships .
but his head has never been entirely clear - the single constant in his career has been his regular crash landings after high jumps .
a ski jumping sex bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald but the negative buzz around hannawald quieted after his historic jumps at this year 's four hills tournament .
instead , the focus shifted to hannawald the advertising commodity or hannawald the heartthrob -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the tabloid press speculated why he still did n't have a girlfriend .
and in his native erzgebirge region in eastern germany , people were bemused by the " winter schumacher 's " quick assimilation in his new life in western germany 's fabled black forest region , where he even picked up the local accent .
since moving , he speaks the local dialect almost as authentically as colleague schmitt , who was born there .
it may be that a southern german accent is more marketable in the world of advertising than the lilt of his native town of erlabrunn in the state of saxony .
after all , a saxon accent did n't help his predecessors any .
take , for example , the case of jens weissflog , another famous ski jumper whose saxon accent is believed to have squashed his chances at a successful career in the world of advertising and corporate sponsorship .
speaking roles in spots for weissflog were unthinkable .
a breakdown of the system the next crash came at the start of this year 's world cup season .
at the first world cup qualifying round in kuusamo , finland , hannawald did n't even place within the top 30 in two rounds .
trainer steiert , whom hannawald has affectionately called his " second father , " had plenty of excuses - temperatures of minus 25 degrees celsius , wind , his skies , a knee operation hannawald underwent last summer .
whatever the case may be , hannawald 's " flight system collapsed , " steiert said .
hannawald went into retreat , took a break from competition and began training more intensively .
now , hannawald is back for this year 's four hills tournament .
just before christmas he won world cup qualifying at engelberg and was selected as athlete of the year 2002 .
the timing could n't have been better .
sponsors , fans and television broadcasters should all be pleased .
with a considerable amount of help from the very marketable hannawald , private broadcaster rtl has managed to transform the once overlooked sport of ski jumping into germany 's no. 3 television sporting event , falling just behind soccer and formula one racing .
and high ratings are expected as hannawald hits the ramp this year .
this one 's for the fans but few believe he can repeat his historical performance - not even hannawald himself .
" i want to offer viewers something so that they do n't waste their time tuning into ski jumping , " he says .
and you can take his word for it .

but then came the 2001/2002 four hills tournament in germany , which transformed hannawald from a half-known ski jumper into a legend .
at the southern german tournament , he did something no one before him had succeeded in doing : he won each of the tournament 's four jumps during the event 's 50th anniversary .
it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .
and in doing so , he wrote sporting history .
hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .
and his leap to fame came with the side affects that often accompany fame : superlatives in the media , television appearances , ads , bags of fan mail , interviews , violations of his privacy , loads of money and , last but not least , numerous marriage proposals .
and on sunday , hannewald did it again , winning the opening jump of the 2002/2003 four hills event in oberstdorf .
a clear head , a clean jump but until his recent ascent , the future of the man dubbed by one german magazine as an " eagle with the angel 's face " seemed a lot less certain .
at one point he bruised his kidneys , at another he suffered a concussion .
but more than anything , he did n't seem psychologically prepared for the huge ski jumping career ahead of him .
unlike his competitors , like friend and colleague martin schmitt , some viewed hannawald as brooding , insecure and hesitant .
at times , it even appeared that the 184 centimeter tall , 60 kilogram athlete might be suffering from an acute case of anorexia .
" if he can get his head cleared , he 'll jump to victory , " his trainer , wolfgang steiert , liked to say .
and so he did : hannawald went on to win two world championships .
but his head has never been entirely clear - the single constant in his career has been his regular crash landings after high jumps .
a ski jumping sex bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald but the negative buzz around hannawald quieted after his historic jumps at this year 's four hills tournament .
instead , the focus shifted to hannawald the advertising commodity or hannawald the heartthrob -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the tabloid press speculated why he still did n't have a girlfriend .
and in his native erzgebirge region in eastern germany , people were bemused by the " winter schumacher 's " quick assimilation in his new life in western germany 's fabled black forest region , where he even picked up the local accent .
since moving , he speaks the local dialect almost as authentically as colleague schmitt , who was born there .
it may be that a southern german accent is more marketable in the world of advertising than the lilt of his native town of erlabrunn in the state of saxony .
after all , a saxon accent did n't help his predecessors any .
take , for example , the case of jens weissflog , another famous ski jumper whose saxon accent is believed to have squashed his chances at a successful career in the world of advertising and corporate sponsorship .
speaking roles in spots for weissflog were unthinkable .
a breakdown of the system the next crash came at the start of this year 's world cup season .
at the first world cup qualifying round in kuusamo , finland , hannawald did n't even place within the top 30 in two rounds .
trainer steiert , whom hannawald has affectionately called his " second father , " had plenty of excuses - temperatures of minus 25 degrees celsius , wind , his skies , a knee operation hannawald underwent last summer .
whatever the case may be , hannawald 's " flight system collapsed , " steiert said .
hannawald went into retreat , took a break from competition and began training more intensively .
now , hannawald is back for this year 's four hills tournament .
just before christmas he won world cup qualifying at engelberg and was selected as athlete of the year 2002 .
the timing could n't have been better .
sponsors , fans and television broadcasters should all be pleased .
with a considerable amount of help from the very marketable hannawald , private broadcaster rtl has managed to transform the once overlooked sport of ski jumping into germany 's no. 3 television sporting event , falling just behind soccer and formula one racing .
and high ratings are expected as hannawald hits the ramp this year .
this one 's for the fans but few believe he can repeat his historical performance - not even hannawald himself .
" i want to offer viewers something so that they do n't waste their time tuning into ski jumping , " he says .
and you can take his word for it .

at the top of his agenda is a test drive of the new transrapid train connecting downtown shanghai with its airport .
together with premiere zhu rongji , schröder will open the much-touted stretch .
prior to their inaugural voyage , schröder will meet with the chinese leaders - including president jiang zemin and his expected successor , deputy president and communist party general secretary hu jintao .
in beijing on sunday , schröder met with the man who brought the transrapid back from the sidelines : premier zhu .
the premier , trained as an engineer , has long been fascinated by the transrapid 's magnetic levitation technology .
again and again , he has asked schröder why this " treasure " has n't been deployed in germany , where it was first developed .
after having taken a ride on a transrapid train on a test track in emsland , germany , in summer 2000 , rongji made the decision that china would help create a breakthrough for the technology .
" a beautiful future " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- left -rrb- and chinese premier zhu rongji -lrb- right -rrb- on sunday , schröder met with zhu -lrb- photo -rrb- , who raised the possibility that additional projects could be announced after their planned ride on the recently completed transrapid line on new year 's day .
zhu compared the german-chinese relationship with the high-speed train , saying , " it also wants to race ahead at 450 kilometers per hour . "
he added that the transrapid had a " beautiful future " in china .
schröder also used the opportunity to give his beijing counterparts a pat on the back , saying that chinese-german relations were " first class " and used the transrapid as an example of how advanced political and economic relations between the countries have become .
on monday morning , schröder plans to meet with chinese president jiang and his handpicked successor , hu , for political talks .
after that , he will join german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and transportation minister manfred stolpe and industry representatives early new year 's day for the opening of the world 's first commercial transrapid line .
the hi-tech train , which can zip on a magnetic cushion at speeds as high as 550 kilometers per hour , will whisk passengers along the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.64 mile -rrb- route between pudong airport and the shanghai financial district in just eight minutes .
construction of the line took less than two years and the joint german-chinese project was completed on schedule .
the chinese were aided by the german engineering firm bögel as well as 50 million euro -lrb- $ 52.2 million -rrb- in financial aid from the german government .
german engineering and industry giants siemens and thyssen-krupp constructed the trains and signaling equipment for the new route .
the entire project is expected to cost in the neighborhood of 1.3 billion euros .
more plans on drawing board for the consortium of companies promoting the transrapid , the shanghai deal was the last hope for the technology .
without the credentials of a route in the port city , the mag-lev technology would likely have disappeared back to the drawing board .
but now , the airport line is intended to prove the transrapid 's viability in around the clock operation .
following the test run this week , siemens and thyssen-krupp are hoping to close a new deal with the government to build additional transrapid routes .
however , few expect schröder will return from his state visit with a declaration of intent from the chinese to build a rumored 200 kilometer route between shanghai and the tourist resort hangzhou .

but for the consortium backing the transrapid , a first german project is no longer as important as it once seemed .

at the top of his agenda is a test drive of the new transrapid train connecting downtown shanghai with its airport .
together with premiere zhu rongji , schröder will open the much-touted stretch .
prior to their inaugural voyage , schröder will meet with the chinese leaders - including president jiang zemin and his expected successor , deputy president and communist party general secretary hu jintao .
in beijing on sunday , schröder met with the man who brought the transrapid back from the sidelines : premier zhu .
the premier , trained as an engineer , has long been fascinated by the transrapid 's magnetic levitation technology .
again and again , he has asked schröder why this " treasure " has n't been deployed in germany , where it was first developed .
after having taken a ride on a transrapid train on a test track in emsland , germany , in summer 2000 , rongji made the decision that china would help create a breakthrough for the technology .
" a beautiful future " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder -lrb- left -rrb- and chinese premier zhu rongji -lrb- right -rrb- on sunday , schröder met with zhu -lrb- photo -rrb- , who raised the possibility that additional projects could be announced after their planned ride on the recently completed transrapid line on new year 's day .
zhu compared the german-chinese relationship with the high-speed train , saying , " it also wants to race ahead at 450 kilometers per hour . "
he added that the transrapid had a " beautiful future " in china .
schröder also used the opportunity to give his beijing counterparts a pat on the back , saying that chinese-german relations were " first class " and used the transrapid as an example of how advanced political and economic relations between the countries have become .
on monday morning , schröder plans to meet with chinese president jiang and his handpicked successor , hu , for political talks .
after that , he will join german economics and labor minister wolfgang clement and transportation minister manfred stolpe and industry representatives early new year 's day for the opening of the world 's first commercial transrapid line .
the hi-tech train , which can zip on a magnetic cushion at speeds as high as 550 kilometers per hour , will whisk passengers along the 30 kilometer -lrb- 18.64 mile -rrb- route between pudong airport and the shanghai financial district in just eight minutes .
construction of the line took less than two years and the joint german-chinese project was completed on schedule .
the chinese were aided by the german engineering firm bögel as well as 50 million euro -lrb- $ 52.2 million -rrb- in financial aid from the german government .
german engineering and industry giants siemens and thyssen-krupp constructed the trains and signaling equipment for the new route .
the entire project is expected to cost in the neighborhood of 1.3 billion euros .
more plans on drawing board for the consortium of companies promoting the transrapid , the shanghai deal was the last hope for the technology .
without the credentials of a route in the port city , the mag-lev technology would likely have disappeared back to the drawing board .
but now , the airport line is intended to prove the transrapid 's viability in around the clock operation .
following the test run this week , siemens and thyssen-krupp are hoping to close a new deal with the government to build additional transrapid routes .
however , few expect schröder will return from his state visit with a declaration of intent from the chinese to build a rumored 200 kilometer route between shanghai and the tourist resort hangzhou .
a line along the 1,250 kilometer stretch between beijing and shanghai is also under consideration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transrapid peer steinbrück , premier of the german state of north rhine-westphalia is hoping for an altogether different signal .
he 's hoping the german government , based on the project 's hopeful success in china , will provide additional subsidies for a planned transrapid project in his state - which would provide a speedy link for commuters between the cities of dortmund and düsseldorf and provide the first commercial application of the railway technology in germany .
but for the consortium backing the transrapid , a first german project is no longer as important as it once seemed .
" the prospects are good that more will be built , " siemens ceo heinrich von pierer , who is traveling in china with schröder , said in beijing on sunday .

but then came the 2001/2002 four hills tournament in germany , which transformed hannawald from a half-known ski jumper into a legend .
at the southern german tournament , he did something no one before him had succeeded in doing : he won each of the tournament 's four jumps during the event 's 50th anniversary .
it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .
and in doing so , he wrote sporting history .
hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .
and his leap to fame came with the side affects that often accompany fame : superlatives in the media , television appearances , ads , bags of fan mail , interviews , violations of his privacy , loads of money and , last but not least , numerous marriage proposals .
and on sunday , hannewald did it again , winning the opening jump of the 2002/2003 four hills event in oberstdorf .
a clear head , a clean jump but until his recent ascent , the future of the man dubbed by one german magazine as an " eagle with the angel 's face " seemed a lot less certain .
at one point he bruised his kidneys , at another he suffered a concussion .
but more than anything , he did n't seem psychologically prepared for the huge ski jumping career ahead of him .
unlike his competitors , like friend and colleague martin schmitt , some viewed hannawald as brooding , insecure and hesitant .
at times , it even appeared that the 184 centimeter tall , 60 kilogram athlete might be suffering from an acute case of anorexia .
" if he can get his head cleared , he 'll jump to victory , " his trainer , wolfgang steiert , liked to say .
and so he did : hannawald went on to win two world championships .
but his head has never been entirely clear - the single constant in his career has been his regular crash landings after high jumps .
a ski jumping sex bomb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven hannawald but the negative buzz around hannawald quieted after his historic jumps at this year 's four hills tournament .
instead , the focus shifted to hannawald the advertising commodity or hannawald the heartthrob -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the tabloid press speculated why he still did n't have a girlfriend .
and in his native erzgebirge region in eastern germany , people were bemused by the " winter schumacher 's " quick assimilation in his new life in western germany 's fabled black forest region , where he even picked up the local accent .
since moving , he speaks the local dialect almost as authentically as colleague schmitt , who was born there .
it may be that a southern german accent is more marketable in the world of advertising than the lilt of his native town of erlabrunn in the state of saxony .
after all , a saxon accent did n't help his predecessors any .
take , for example , the case of jens weissflog , another famous ski jumper whose saxon accent is believed to have squashed his chances at a successful career in the world of advertising and corporate sponsorship .
speaking roles in spots for weissflog were unthinkable .
a breakdown of the system the next crash came at the start of this year 's world cup season .
at the first world cup qualifying round in kuusamo , finland , hannawald did n't even place within the top 30 in two rounds .
trainer steiert , whom hannawald has affectionately called his " second father , " had plenty of excuses - temperatures of minus 25 degrees celsius , wind , his skies , a knee operation hannawald underwent last summer .
whatever the case may be , hannawald 's " flight system collapsed , " steiert said .
hannawald went into retreat , took a break from competition and began training more intensively .
now , hannawald is back for this year 's four hills tournament .
just before christmas he won world cup qualifying at engelberg and was selected as athlete of the year 2002 .
the timing could n't have been better .
sponsors , fans and television broadcasters should all be pleased .
with a considerable amount of help from the very marketable hannawald , private broadcaster rtl has managed to transform the once overlooked sport of ski jumping into germany 's no. 3 television sporting event , falling just behind soccer and formula one racing .
and high ratings are expected as hannawald hits the ramp this year .
this one 's for the fans but few believe he can repeat his historical performance - not even hannawald himself .
" i want to offer viewers something so that they do n't waste their time tuning into ski jumping , " he says .
and you can take his word for it .
for viewers are allowed to expect whatever they want from hannawald - but there 's one thing he can guarantee they wo n't get - and that 's bored . oliver samson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dominating the snow and ice 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it was a scene so perfect it seemed straight out of a movie : against formidable competition from finland 's matti hautamäki , hannewald , who was the last jumper of the day , succeeded in defending himself from the finn 's airborne onslaught .
and in doing so , he wrote sporting history .
hannewald entered into the legion of german sporting heroes - a squadron of luminaries that runs from boxer max schmeling , to tennis hero boris becker , to racing giant michael schumacher and cyclist jan ulrich .
and his leap to fame came with the side affects that often accompany fame : superlatives in the media , television appearances , ads , bags of fan mail , interviews , violations of his privacy , loads of money and , last but not least , numerous marriage proposals .
and on sunday , hannewald did it again , winning the opening jump of the 2002/2003 four hills event in oberstdorf .
a clear head , a clean jump but until his recent ascent , the future of the man dubbed by one german magazine as an " eagle with the angel 's face " seemed a lot less certain .
at one point he bruised his kidneys , at another he suffered a concussion .
but more than anything , he did n't seem psychologically prepared for the huge ski jumping career ahead of him .
unlike his competitors , like friend and colleague martin schmitt , some viewed hannawald as brooding , insecure and hesitant .
at times , it even appeared that the 184 centimeter tall , 60 kilogram athlete might be suffering from an acute case of anorexia .
" if he can get his head cleared , he 'll jump to victory , " his trainer , wolfgang steiert , liked to say .
and so he did : hannawald went on to win two world championships .
but his head has never been entirely clear - the single constant in his career has been his regular crash landings after high jumps .

instead , the focus shifted to hannawald the advertising commodity or hannawald the heartthrob -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the tabloid press speculated why he still did n't have a girlfriend .
and in his native erzgebirge region in eastern germany , people were bemused by the " winter schumacher 's " quick assimilation in his new life in western germany 's fabled black forest region , where he even picked up the local accent .
since moving , he speaks the local dialect almost as authentically as colleague schmitt , who was born there .
it may be that a southern german accent is more marketable in the world of advertising than the lilt of his native town of erlabrunn in the state of saxony .
after all , a saxon accent did n't help his predecessors any .
take , for example , the case of jens weissflog , another famous ski jumper whose saxon accent is believed to have squashed his chances at a successful career in the world of advertising and corporate sponsorship .
speaking roles in spots for weissflog were unthinkable .
a breakdown of the system the next crash came at the start of this year 's world cup season .
at the first world cup qualifying round in kuusamo , finland , hannawald did n't even place within the top 30 in two rounds .
trainer steiert , whom hannawald has affectionately called his " second father , " had plenty of excuses - temperatures of minus 25 degrees celsius , wind , his skies , a knee operation hannawald underwent last summer .
whatever the case may be , hannawald 's " flight system collapsed , " steiert said .
hannawald went into retreat , took a break from competition and began training more intensively .
now , hannawald is back for this year 's four hills tournament .
just before christmas he won world cup qualifying at engelberg and was selected as athlete of the year 2002 .
the timing could n't have been better .
sponsors , fans and television broadcasters should all be pleased .
with a considerable amount of help from the very marketable hannawald , private broadcaster rtl has managed to transform the once overlooked sport of ski jumping into germany 's no. 3 television sporting event , falling just behind soccer and formula one racing .
and high ratings are expected as hannawald hits the ramp this year .
this one 's for the fans but few believe he can repeat his historical performance - not even hannawald himself .
" i want to offer viewers something so that they do n't waste their time tuning into ski jumping , " he says .
and you can take his word for it .
for viewers are allowed to expect whatever they want from hannawald - but there 's one thing he can guarantee they wo n't get - and that 's bored . oliver samson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dominating the snow and ice 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .
