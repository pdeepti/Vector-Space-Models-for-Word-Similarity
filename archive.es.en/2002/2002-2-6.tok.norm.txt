but the laughter has only just returned .
in the beginning no matter what the gods of the day may claim , the celluloid universe was not created in hollywood , but in inventors ' workshops on both sides of the atlantic .
ingenious and petty , some artful , some crass , they set about transferring the light and shadows of our physical world onto film , until in silence it appeared .
in germany , it happened at babelsberg , near berlin .
light projector here the seething intelligence , idealism , paranoia and lust of the weimar era found its way onto babelsberg ’ s reels .
the strivings of the modern era , in their desperate earnestness , found their expression in fritz lang ’ s legendary 1927 babelsberg production , ‘ metropolis ’ , in a celluloid prefiguration of the impersonal utopia of the mega-city .
roaring through the 1920 ’ s , babelsberg rivalled hollywood , reeling out hundreds of films each year .
and when the medium finally found its voice in 1930 , it was marlene dietrich ’ s as ‘ the blue angel ’ .
in germany ’ s first talking movie , she struck a note of doomed love and incautious obsession – " men flock around me , like moths around a flame .
if their wings burn , i know i 'm not to blame . "
dark years but silence returned .
first the nazi seizure of power made germany ’ s film industry part of its propaganda machine , and much of the free-thinking talent escaped abroad , including dietrich .
it was an keen twist of justice that as racist state co-opted germany ’ s art world and coerced cultural suicide , hollywood studios thrived , often under the leadership of jewish emigrants who had left the continent decades before .
the warner brothers hailed from krasnashiltz , poland .
samuel goldwyn , who built mgm , was also a polish jew .
carl laemmle , founder of universal , came from bavaria , while an austro-hungarian-born man named wilhelm fried changed his name to fox and built a studio of his own .
babelsberg ’ s fate was sealed , not just by nazi rule but then by communism , as it fell in the post-wart russian sector that became east germany .
the studio had half a century more of propagandistic work ahead of it as headquarters of the german democratic republic ’ s production company , defa .
all that left babelsberg thoroughly exhausted yet ready for renewal through the 1990 ’ s .
a new life 2001 was a milestone year , with the release of jean-jacques annaud ’ s babelsberg-filmed ‘ duell – enemy at the gates ’ , a war-romance set in stalingrad that was the most expensive european feature film to date .
it kicked off that year ’ s berlin film festival .
another big work filmed at the studio , soon to be released , is roman polanski ’ s ‘ the pianist ’ – a story of survival in occupied poland during world war ii – for which babelsberg ’ s set-construction crew had to recreate a quarter of the old warsaw ghetto .
the next epic feature in the works is a 2003 project by the american actress and producer jodie foster .
she plans to dramatise the life of leni riefenstahl , the controversial german filmmaker who as a friend of adolf hitler made nazi propaganda films that , despite the brute sickness of their content , still win some critical praise for their style .
so despite ‘ sumo bruno ’ and the rest of babelsberg ’ s lighter fare – such awful history retains its force , attracting some artists , no doubt repelling others .
it is this studio ’ s peculiar fate that , as a place where man pioneered his manipulation of light and shadow , the darkness here still dominates – yet stars sometimes appear , drawn by the echoing song of a blue angel . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bavaria film continues expansion swift business at germany 's biggest studio -lrb- december 10 , 2001 -rrb- dw-world : flirting with controversy leni riefenstahl thrives on controversy .

their people are not evil but the governments that lead them are evil colin powell mr powell defended the president 's description of iraq , iran and north korea , but said mr bush was referring to their leaders , not their people .
the secretary of state said that while mr bush 's remarks did not mean america was about to invade any of the states , " action is going to be required " .
president bush 's comments , in his state of the union speech last wednesday , have been criticised by iraq , iran and north korea , as well as some of america 's allies around the world and even from within his republican party .

iraq : suspected of wanting to pursue programmes to develop nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons and missile developments 2 .
iran : listed by us as state sponsor of terrorism .

north korea : the us 's main concern has been missiles and other weapons programmes and willingness to export sensitive technology see also : detailed clickable map mr powell said america was ready to hold talks with north korea unconditionally , but rejected iraq 's offer on monday to resume talks with the united nations on the issue of sanctions .
on iran , mr powell said washington had a long list of grievances - but he also acknowledged iran 's co-operation over afghanistan .
the bbc 's state department correspondent jon leyne says what was most noticeable was the difference in tone between mr powell 's remarks , the president 's speech and subsequent tough comments by the defence secretary , donald rumsfeld .
speaking to the senate foreign relations committee , however , mr powell said mr bush 's characterisation was fair .
" -lsb- iraq , iran and north korea -rsb- are deserving of this kind of designation " , he said .
" there is no reason for us not to identify them for what they are : regimes that are inherently evil , " mr powell told the committee .
war will continue mr powell said the president had tried to make the point that the war on terror would not end as long as there were " still regimes out there " that were developing weapons of mass destruction .
the secretary of state said he stood by the president 's words , which were reminiscent of former us president ronald reagan 's description of the soviet union as an " evil empire " .

the royal national institute for deaf people in scotland -lrb- rnid -rrb- has called on the scottish executive to follow the example south of the border and back funding for digital hearing aids .
rnid said that 170,000 people in scotland registered deaf or with a hearing aid could benefit from the devices .
at present , it said only 1.4 % of people who need the hearing aids receive them and other people have been making do with outdated devices .
the organisation said this compares starkly with england and wales , where by next year a third of patients could have access to the hearing aids .
the digital aids cost about £ 2,000 but the rnid estimates that with bulk nhs buying the devices could cost less than £ 100 each .
the charity 's report " scottish audiology going digital " also pointed to " severe problems " in scottish nhs services , with more staff and investment needed .
rnid chief executive , james strachan , said : " digital hearing aids have the power to revolutionise lives but modern hearing aids can not be provided while audiology departments are being starved of cash .
" the robust evidence exists in england and wales that patients benefit significantly - by more than 40 % from digital compared to analogue aids . "
a scottish executive spokesman said it was committed to driving up standards for all those affected by hearing impairment and has already commissioned a review of audiology services across scotland .
the findings are expected in the autumn .

the government made the order to try to prevent a run on bank deposits by people trying to convert their savings to us dollars .
banks and other currency traders have remained shut since sunday when the government announced an end to exchange rate controls - a move expected to send the value of the pesos plummeting .
the bbc 's peter greste in buenos aires says a run on the banks would have the twin effect of crashing the entire banking system and collapsing the value of the argentine peso .
he says either would be disastrous on its own , but together they would be nothing short of catastrophic for a country embroiled in its worst economic crisis for decades .
economic reforms argentina 's mainly foreign-owned banks have most to lose from the reforms , as loans taken out in dollars will now be converted into pesos at a rate of one to one .
new measures peso to become fully convertible some bank restrictions lifted dollar loans switched to pesos at 1:1 dollar borrowings switched to pesos as 1:1.4 budget deficit three times less than the previous year bank deposits in dollars , however , will be converted into pesos at the rate of 1.4 pesos to the dollar .
this means argentine borrowers will gain from the overhaul , but savers with deposits in dollars will lose money .
the 1.4 exchange rate replaced a 10-year-old one-to-one peg between the two currencies .
that system was criticised by the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and highlighted as a barrier to the resumption of economic assistance .
earlier tuesday , the government unveiled an austere budget aimed at winning the release of $ 20bn in additional aid frozen by the imf in december .
under the plan , public spending will be slashed by $ 3.5bn to try to narrow a budget deficit of more than $ 10bn last year .
argentine president eduardo duhalde , meanwhile , has announced that elections will be held on 14 september next year .
the president , who took over amid a political crisis following the resignation of president fernando de la rua in december , said he will serve out the remainder of his term .

welsh health minister jane hutt will tell the committee on wednesday that the bill for this kind of claim has quadrupled in the last four years .
the cost of clinical negligence claims over £ 30,000 is met from the all wales risk pool , and nhs trusts are required to make a contribution to this every year .
however , in recent years the cost of these claims has risen sharply and it is expected to continue to rise .
in 2000 , £ 26.9m was spent by the nhs in wales on clinical negligence claims , while it is estimated that claims which are still awaiting settlement could cost he health service well over £ 100m .
last august , the assembly 's audit committee warned that new systems were urgently needed to reduce negligence incidents the chair of the audit committee janet davies said members were concerned at the slow pace of change .
" all trusts need to have systems in place to tell them what is going wrong when claims are made , but most trusts do not . "
' no blame ' culture of particular concern was the lack of information management had to enable them to identify the causes of clinical negligence indents and so make changes to prevent them .
ms davies said there was also a need for a " no blame " culture within the nhs so clinicians could speak frankly with patients and problems could be identified and fixed .
last month ms hutt announced she was cancelling the outstanding debts of health authorities and nhs trusts in wales .
all loans made to health authorities and trusts before march last year are to be written off .
dyfed powys and bro taf are the main beneficiairies , together with three west wales nhs trusts and the cardiff & vale trust .
dyfed powys health authority 's loans total over £ 23m , while bro taf 's debts are almost £ 7m .
the aim is to give the new local health boards which will take over from the health authorities in april 2003 under nhs reform in wales ' a clean slate ' .

"
it is extraordinary for the us to have to charge one of its own citizens with aiding and conspiring with international terrorist groups whose agenda is to kill americans " us attorney general john ashcroft the indictment , which was handed down by a grand jury in eastern virginia , formalised the six charges filed against him last month and added four more .
the 20-year-old californian muslim , who was captured in afghanistan and sent back to the us , faces several life sentences in prison if convicted .
he is due to make a second court appearance in virginia on wednesday , where his lawyers are expected to apply for his release until trial .
" there is no evidence that mr walker made any attempt to engage in combat with united states military forces , let alone to harm any civilian , " they said .
they argue that their client 's apparent confession to taleban membership was extracted under " highly coercive circumstances " .
but correspondents say the grand jury indictment makes the prospect of release unlikely .
' trained terrorist ' announcing the indictment at the us justice department , attorney general john ashcroft said it described mr walker as " an al-qaeda-trained terrorist who conspired with the taleban to kill his fellow citizens " .
he said the indictment was based in part on voluntary statements made by mr walker .
the new charges are : conspiracy to contribute services to al-qaeda contributing services to the network conspiracy to supply services to the taleban using and carrying firearms and destructive devices during crimes of violence mr walker had already been charged with : conspiracy to murder us citizens or us nationals two counts of conspiracy to provide material support and resources to designated foreign terrorist organisations two counts of providing material support and resources to terrorist organisations supplying services to the taleban asked whether the government would ask the grand jury to charge mr walker with treason , us attorney paul j mcnulty said : " as far as other charges , we have the opportunity or right to have a superseding indictment if the evidence justifies that . "
' brute force ' mr ashcroft said the indictment presented a timeline of mr walker 's involvement with terrorism .
the charge sheet said that in early summer 2001 , mr walker was in an al-qaeda training camp in afghanistan .
later , as the network made its alleged preparation for the attacks of 11 september , mr walker was " forging ever deeper bonds " with al-qaeda and met america 's foremost suspect , osama bin laden , mr ashcroft said .
mr ashcroft said that on 11 september , mr walker was fighting alongside the taleban in afghanistan , and in the weeks after the attack he remained with his fighting camp , despite knowing about the suicide attacks and being aware that additional attacks were planned .
as the us launched its war against terrorism in afghanistan , mr walker remained " shoulder to shoulder " with the taleban , mr ashcroft said .
" the us is a country of laws ...
walker lindh only recognised the law of brute force . "
