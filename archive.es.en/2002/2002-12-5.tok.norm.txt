st john 's roman catholic primary school in rochdale was bottom of the league table for absences , according to the department for education and skills figures .
a total of 8.6 % of half-days lost at the school are due to unauthorised absences .
headteacher jed morgan said the problem was not truancy , adding that some of the 160 pupils are from traveller communities and those of asylum-seekers and were difficult to trace .
it 's not as though we are not doing anything about it - we are doing absolutely everything we can jed morgan mr morgan said his school had not received any extra money for anti-truancy measures .
he said : " we have a large number of traveller and asylum-seeker children who , for reasons we do n't always understand , we ca n't always trace where they are .
" it 's not as though we are not doing anything about it - we are doing absolutely everything we can .
" examples of unauthorised absence are parents who keep their children close because they are afraid that the authorities are going to take the younger children and the mother away and deport them .
" they are frightened and it is an example of one of the difficulties we face . "
st john 's was in danger of closure after it failed an ofsted inspection in 1999 but the threat was lifted last march , six months after mr morgan took over as headteacher .
he added : " we are desperate to build up the school . "
as part of the effort to improve attendance , a reward scheme was set up , and parents were telephoned if their child did not turn up .

hearing enhancement , in livingston , west lothian , has created a system which stops aids from emitting a loud whistling noise when a mobile is held close .
the invention coincides with a campaign by the royal national institute for the deaf -lrb- rnid -rrb- to persuade the scottish executive to pay for digital hearing aids .
rnid campaigners urged msps on thursday to back their call for modernised audiology services .
hearing loss can leave people feeling alienated and alone john low rnid the charity said scotland had fallen behind england and wales in the modernisation of hearing aid services .
according to the rnid , one in five of the adult population in scotland is deaf or hard of hearing .
it said 500,000 of these 730,000 people would benefit from a modern digital hearing aid , yet only 1.6 % actually have one .
' missing out ' in the meantime a new device , invented by hearing enhancement , promises to work with any hearing aid which has a t-switch -lrb- telecoil -rrb- function .
the company said the " picoloop " allows hearing aid wearers to use mobiles for voice communication , rather than just text messaging .
it looks like a small flip-style phone and is connected to the user 's mobile by a single lead .
with a miniature antenna placed next to the hearing aid , the company described the result as " incredible volume and clarity " .
the picoloop : " volume and clarity " the only alternative in scotland is to pay for private digital hearing aids , which cost up to £ 2,500 .
rnid said this could be reduced to £ 70.75 by using the bulk purchasing power of the nhs .
the institute 's chief executive , john low , said : " it is about time that deaf and hard of hearing people were given access to modernised nhs audiology services and the latest digital hearing aid technology .
" hearing loss can leave people feeling alienated and alone .
" many patients in scotland may be missing out on so much while waiting for new hearing aid technology to be introduced - whether an anniversary dinner , a new film , or the first words a grandchild speaks .
" the executive needs to realise how much is to be gained by investing in modernised audiology services and help deaf and hard of hearing people in scotland . "

the average income is more than £ 33,000 a year - swelled by high-earning city workers and millionaire rock stars .
but this is something surrey county council is sick of hearing .
its conservative leader nick skellet says : " there is a perception everyone in surrey is wealthy .
" there is relative private affluence .
i am sure our children will be losing out in surrey carol rusby " but there is public service impoverishment too . "
the county receives the lowest level of government grant per head of any authority in the country but faces the highest costs outside london .
and it is struggling to provide the level of care and protection it would like for the elderly and vulnerable children .
care home places are expensive and in short supply .
on average there are 150 people in surrey unable to leave hospital because there is no care place for them .
and soon , like all councils , surrey will be fined by its health service if it does not do more to reduce bed-blocking .
even before the change in grant formula , surrey says its needs are unrecognised .
for vulnerable children , the current formula assesses surrey 's spending needs at £ 95 a head .
nearby croydon 's is put at £ 235 .
surrey 's finance director mike taylor says : " ministers do not seem to recognise the incidence of disability in children , for instance , is the same across the country .
it is looking more grim than any year i can remember mike taylor surrey county council " it does not vary with ethnicity or housing density . "
though its schools are among the best in the country , surrey is struggling to recruit and retain teachers - especially in those areas which border greater london .
just by moving to a school down the road teachers can pick up an extra £ 1,500 in london weighting allowance .
at esher high school they are lucky .
they have a full complement of teachers - all of them specialists .
but headteacher simon morris knows they may be hard to keep .
" if they moved to the midlands or north they would be owning their own house .
" in surrey there is every chance , especially for newly-qualified teachers , they would be living in a one-bedroom rented flat earning the same amount of money with a token recognition of the extra cost of living of only £ 792 . "
so desperate is the shortage of affordable housing for teachers that surrey has been asking schools if they have any spare land that can be used to build teacher accommodation .
now , on top of all these pressures , comes the prospect of a new grant formula that may divert cash to the north and midlands .
if the government believes there is a north-south issue , they should fund that through national taxation not increase council taxes in the south in order to fund the north surrey county council leader nick skellet that is worrying parent carol rusby .
" i am very concerned .
" children in all parts of the country need the same basic education .
" they need books .
" they need teachers .
" they need their schools heated , lit and maintained .
" so i am sure our children will be losing out in surrey . "
the government has denied any agenda to shift resources from one part of the country to another and has guaranteed no authority will receive less grant than this year .
but in surrey a cash freeze alone would have a marked effect .
because of inflation and other pressures the council believes it may be faced with a shortfall of £ 60m and would need a council tax rise of 20 % to fill it .
mr taylor says they are being expected to increase spending with less money .
double whammy chancellor gordon brown is expecting big spending increases on education and social services .
but deputy prime minister john prescott is changing the funding formula in a way that could harm counties in the south east .
" we have a double whammy on surrey taxpayers - an increase in investment and a loss of grant , which will lead to big council tax increases .
" it is looking more grim than any year i can remember . "
surrey has clubbed together with other counties , including kent and hampshire , to form a save the south east campaign .
mr skellett says : " the government is seeking to rebalance what they see as a north-south divide through raising council tax in the south with no betterment of services .
" if the government believes there is a north-south issue , they should fund that through national taxation not increase council taxes in the south in order to fund the north . "
