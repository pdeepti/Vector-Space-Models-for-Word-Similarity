the churches ' child protection advisory service -lrb- ccaps -rrb- says that in many churches and christian groups , procedures to safeguard children are lax .
in the worst cases , the churches are accused of colluding in child abuse .
the documents outlining these fears are to be presented to the victoria climbie inquiry on friday and have been shown to bbc radio 4 's today programme .
' no training ' victoria died in february 2000 after months of abuse by her carers - her great-aunt marie therese kouao and kouao 's boyfriend , carl manning .
her death came despite regular contact with four local authorities , two police child protection teams , two hospitals and social workers .
the second victoria climbie inquiry phase two seminar is on friday , as part of the five-meeting series debating changes to the uk 's child protection system .
this seminar will discuss the role of the nation 's churches in identifying the needs of children at risk .
during the first phase of the inquiry , which focused on victoria 's case , it was revealed that preachers at three churches failed to notice that victoria was in danger .
the eight-year-old was taken to churches by kouao and one pastor who saw victoria admitted to the inquiry , in october , that he had believed the little girl was possessed .
pascal orome , of the mission ensemble pour christ church , borough , south london , said : " what i had heard did not sound like a medical problem .
i thought it would more likely be a spiritual problem . "
a survey of theological colleges by the ccaps found that only half of the respondents offered child protection training to future ministers .
among those attending the seminar is ccaps director david pearson , who has helped provide many churches with comprehensive training on this issue .

in experimental conditions , chemicals dissolved in waste water from oil platforms stunted the growth of the fish and affected their breeding patterns , the researchers found .
it is not known how seriously cod are being affected in the wild .
but the research will put pressure on oil companies to find other ways of disposing of the waste .
the oil brought up from reserves beneath the sea bed is mixed in with a large amount of fresh water .
that water is separated off at the surface and pumped back into the sea , but it contains chemical compounds which can seriously disrupt some biological functions .
scientists at the norwegian marine research institute in bergen found that when cod were exposed to this solution , their eggs became smaller and spawning was delayed .
threat that meant they were out of synch with the availability of the plankton they need to grow - a sort of ecological mismatch .
the news comes after north sea states urged cuts in fish catches on thursday to rescue stocks of species ranging from cod to haddock .
fishing threatens to wipe out species such as cod , hake , haddock and mackerel in the north sea .
but fishing levels are subject to strict quotas from the eu .

the two countries - whose relations have been frosty for years - are co-hosting the event , which runs from 31 may to 30 june .
" we agreed to make the world cup finals the best tournament in history " said japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi .

tokyo believes the missing japanese were kidnapped to train as spies or to teach agents the japanese language and customs .

energy giant enron collapsed after it was revealed that it hid debts so they did not show up in the company 's accounts .
the firm 's auditors , andersen , face charges over alleged destruction of documents relating to enron , and has lost several senior clients due to concerns over its auditing of the failed company 's accounts .
securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- chairman harvey pitt told senators that accountants needed a new body to oversee them .
powers to revoke the proposed body , the public accountability board , would be " composed predominantly of independent public members , unaffiliated with the accounting profession ... -lrb- and -rrb- a small minority of members from the accounting profession " with a non-accountant chairperson , he said .
the board 's first members would be picked by the sec , he proposed , with subsequent appointments subject to sec review .
funding for the watchdog would come from mandatory fees paid by accounting firms and from corporations , he said .
auditors submitting opinions to the sec would have to be board members subject to regular review by pab staff .
the watchdog would have the powers to revoke a firm 's or an accountant 's rights to practice before the sec .
honesty clause it could also force a public company to change auditors if its present auditor was found wanting , mr pitt said .
the us accounting industry currently has a number of self-regulatory groups , such as the american institute of certified public accountants , the financial accounting standards board and the public oversight board .
mr pitt also told senators the sec was considering a new rule to require chief executive officers to certify personally to shareholders that financial disclosures are complete and honest , he said .

the tie-up continues a trend that has seen many british gas and electricity sellers snapped up by european competitors in recent years .
the 275 pence per share deal will cost rwe a total of £ 5.5bn -lrb- $ 7.8bn -rrb- .
swindon-based innogy was formerly part of national power and includes the brands yorkshire power , northern electric and npower .
over half of the power-generating capacity of the uk will be in foreign hands following the takeover of innogy .
super-powers many european utilities have been on the acquisition trail in recent years , faced with the prospect of losing market share in their domestic market due to increased competition .
the uk 's power industry was privatised in 1989-1990 in a deliberately fragmented structure aimed at creating competition .
rwe already owns thames water , the uk 's largest water and sewerage company , for which it paid £ 4.3bn last year .
rwe 's rival utility , e.on , is on the verge of completing a takeover of powergen .
and france 's edf also owns a chunk of two regional electricity businesses - london electricity and south west electricity .
competition fears the deal is still subject to regulatory approval .
edf , e.on and rwe have been steadily becoming a new league of super-utilities , despite some eyebrows raised over competition concerns .
" the european electricity market has consolidated extremely rapidly ... this process has gone on with serious benign neglect from the commission , dieter helm , director of uk consultancy oxera , told a conference in amsterdam earlier this week .
rwe investors have been cautious about the deal , and will be seeking an explanation behind the financial logic of the deal on friday . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's dominic di-natale " the americans do not consider rwe a true utility " see also : 18 feb 02 -pipe- business innogy shares soar on takeover interest 26 aug 01 -pipe- business german utility giant on takeover path 17 sep 01 -pipe- business german $ 7.6bn bid for us utility 30 aug 01 -pipe- business 1,000 energy company jobs go 01 aug 01 -pipe- wales new wind energy plans revealed 09 apr 01 -pipe- business german takeover bid for powergen internet links : innogy rwe the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : worldcom chiefs refuse to testify buoyant ebay snaps up bills firm digital tv woes hit pace profits bush vows action after scandals merck ' exaggerated ' revenue in accounts congress pushes accounting reform oil trade thaws us-russian ties hiv : the drug firms ' quest for a cure links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

the most senior family court judge in england and wales , dame elizabeth butler-sloss , will deliver her judgment in a three-way video link between birmingham , london , and the woman 's hospital bed .
the woman - known only as miss b - has been told there is only a 1 % chance of recovery from paralysis and wants to be allowed to die .
doctors oppose her request because they say it defies their guiding principles to protect life .
but dr richard nicholson of the bulletin for medical ethics said he would be " astounded " if the ruling did not go in the woman 's favour .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme the case appeared to be about the right of doctors " to override decisions of competent adults " .
he also cast doubts on doctors ' insistence that their primary concern must be to preserve life .
" the first requirement of the hippocratic oath is ' do no harm ' .
if you are preserving life at all costs but in order to do so the patient reckons you are harming them ... then you are in breach of that first ' do no harm ' requirement , " he said .
patient ' respect ' liberal democrat health spokesman dr evan harris agreed that doctors should do more to recognise patient autonomy . "
patients have a right to decide their own destination - even if that decision is felt to be irrational " dr evan harris , lib dem health spokesman " some doctors still do n't have the message that patients have a right to decide their own destination with regard to treatment - even if that decision is felt to be irrational .
" if a patient has capacity that wish has to be respected , " he told today .
dame elizabeth will give the judgment by video link because the judge will be in birmingham , the barristers in the london high court and miss b in her hospital bed .
miss b , who was left paralysed from the neck down after a blood clot lodged near her spine a year ago , has previously given video evidence from hospital .
miss b has told the court she would not like to switch off the system herself , because that would look to her loved ones like suicide .
and she has rejected an opportunity to be " weaned " off the ventilator , which she said would mean being given inadequate ventilation , waiting to contract a subsequent infection and then suffering a slow , and painful death .
european court under current law somebody mentally competent can decide to refuse medical treatment .
in august 2001 , two psychiatrists declared miss b was mentally competent to make decisions about her future - but she told the court that despite this , no-one had listened to her wishes .
doctors are arguing that if they were given time to try to improve miss b 's quality of life - with , for instance , various rehabilitation aids - that might change her mind .
they have also said that on occasions , miss b had been ambivalent about what she wanted to happen - so they were not certain whether she was unequivocal in wanting to be allowed to die .
the decision comes in the same week that motor neurone disease sufferer diane pretty went to the european court of human rights in an effort to gain permission for her husband to help her die .
a ruling in that case is not expected for at least two weeks .

officers can issue fixed penalty notices for a range of offences , such as being drunk and disorderly , throwing fireworks , and trespassing on a railway . £ 80 fixed penalty offences wasting police time sending false messages knowingly giving a false alarm to a fire brigade causing harassment , alarm or distress north wales police is one of five force areas in the uk where the scheme is to be tested , according to reports .
but the home office has played down the planned fines are a done deal , saying no decision on pilot areas had been taken .
the fines will vary between £ 40 and £ 80 depending on the offence and follow legislation decreed in the 2001 criminal justice and police act , drawn up in 2001 .
it is the latest element in uk home secretary david blunkett 's assault on street crime .
earlier in march , the minister , who will give more details at wales labour 's spring conference in llandudno later , revealed plans for civilian wardens to assist police officers .
the idea first came up when tony blair suggested taking yobs to cashpoints to pay fines .
the prime minister was criticised and praised in equal measure , but the fines will now be payable at a later date and can be challenged in court .
while no starting date for the scheme has been set yet , it is likely to be later this year .
the other forces involved are the west midlands , the metropolitan police , essex and british transport police .
but the idea has been labelled " flawed " by the north wales police federation .
" in reality , people do n't want yobs left outside their homes - they want them removed , " secretary elect richard eccles said .
" we have the poer to arrest and detain these people and that is what people in north wales want . "
conservative home affairs spokesperson dominic greaves added : " if people are misbehaving in the streets , neighbours will want them removed , " " merely handing them a notice is not going to address the problem .
" the way to deal with them is quick arresting and to bring them before the courts . "
and the conservatives have voiced scepticism time limit " this has followed on from comments made by the prime minister some time ago referring to offenders for drinking offences being fined on the spot , " said deputy assistant constable steve house , the officer in charge of the introduction of the scheme . £ 40 fixed penalty offences throwing fireworks wilful obstruction other than with a vehicle drunk and disorderly trespassing on a railway throwing stones at trains drunk in a highway buying alcohol for under 18s drinking in a designated place " this led to the association of chief police officers looking at the possibility of fixed penalty notices for a range of offences .
" this will not be on-the-spot fines and there will be no collection of money by police officers , " stressed mr house .
" an offender will probably be able to pay within a set time at a certain amount .
" it will be £ 40 or £ 80 depending on the offence but presumably there may be an increase in the amount to be paid if they take the case to court and are found guilty . "
mr house also revealed the notices will only be issued by police officers and not by civilian staff .
" officers will either carry a book of notices , or the notices book may be kept elsewhere and brought to an officer who needs it , " he said .

officers can issue fixed penalty notices for a range of offences , such as being drunk and disorderly , throwing fireworks , and trespassing on a railway . £ 80 fixed penalty offences wasting police time sending false messages knowingly giving a false alarm to a fire brigade causing harassment , alarm or distress north wales police is one of five force areas in the uk where the scheme is to be tested , according to reports .
but the home office has played down the planned fines are a done deal , saying no decision on pilot areas had been taken .
the fines will vary between £ 40 and £ 80 depending on the offence and follow legislation decreed in the 2001 criminal justice and police act , drawn up in 2001 .
it is the latest element in uk home secretary david blunkett 's assault on street crime .
earlier in march , the minister , who will give more details at wales labour 's spring conference in llandudno later , revealed plans for civilian wardens to assist police officers .
the idea first came up when tony blair suggested taking yobs to cashpoints to pay fines .
the prime minister was criticised and praised in equal measure , but the fines will now be payable at a later date and can be challenged in court .
while no starting date for the scheme has been set yet , it is likely to be later this year .
the other forces involved are the west midlands , the metropolitan police , essex and british transport police .
but the idea has been labelled " flawed " by the north wales police federation .
" in reality , people do n't want yobs left outside their homes - they want them removed , " secretary elect richard eccles said .
" we have the poer to arrest and detain these people and that is what people in north wales want . "
conservative home affairs spokesperson dominic greaves added : " if people are misbehaving in the streets , neighbours will want them removed , " " merely handing them a notice is not going to address the problem .
" the way to deal with them is quick arresting and to bring them before the courts . "
and the conservatives have voiced scepticism time limit " this has followed on from comments made by the prime minister some time ago referring to offenders for drinking offences being fined on the spot , " said deputy assistant constable steve house , the officer in charge of the introduction of the scheme . £ 40 fixed penalty offences throwing fireworks wilful obstruction other than with a vehicle drunk and disorderly trespassing on a railway throwing stones at trains drunk in a highway buying alcohol for under 18s drinking in a designated place " this led to the association of chief police officers looking at the possibility of fixed penalty notices for a range of offences .
" this will not be on-the-spot fines and there will be no collection of money by police officers , " stressed mr house .
" an offender will probably be able to pay within a set time at a certain amount .
" it will be £ 40 or £ 80 depending on the offence but presumably there may be an increase in the amount to be paid if they take the case to court and are found guilty . "
mr house also revealed the notices will only be issued by police officers and not by civilian staff .
" officers will either carry a book of notices , or the notices book may be kept elsewhere and brought to an officer who needs it , " he said . watch / listen on this story richard eccles , north wales police federation " in reality , the plan is flawed " dominic greaves , conservative " this is not going to address the problem " bbc wales 's colette hume " the maesgierchan estate in bangor is one of the areas that could benefit from the new scheme " your say are fines for street offences a good idea ?

they go to work early in the morning , sit at work benches or in front of machines and perform the same repetitive tasks all day .
some have followed fathers and uncles into the manufacturing industry , which until recently used to be the main employer of the midlands ' young men and women .
midlanders have worked for more than 30 years in factories their daily output and commitment are staggering .
in solihull , workers at land rover build 11 cars an hour .
a few miles away on the outskirts of birmingham city centre , 62 employees at acme whistles turn out 5-6,000 whistles in an eight-hour shift .
working overtime within acme 's packaging room , kamela spends her days sitting on a tall chair polishing whistles and wrapping them in tissue paper .
she has worked here for 25 years .
in the last three months , we have n't made any money russell luckock a.e. harris a few rooms away , errol , a company veteran of 28 years , does heavy-duty polishing on a machine .
in a quieter space , linda , june and pam hammer parts together as they listen to their walkmans .
take away the walkmans and the scene would have been the same 50 years ago - except there might have been more people in the room .
modern manufacturing things could not be more different at land rover , where ford has invested millions in improving the production lines .
ford has invested millions at land rover as the body of the new range rover progresses down the line , machines twist it on one side to allow workers easy access to fuel lines and other parts .
years ago , workers would have been lying on their backs underneath the car .
since the us car company ford took over land rover in 2000 and invested millions , the midlands car maker has found a new lease of life .
but , even though land rover 's premium brand has shielded it from the worst of the global slowdown , it still contends with the same problems that affect smaller companies like acme whistles .
common ground the strong pound , weaknesses in the national infrastructure , competition from the far east and government regulations have all increased the stranglehold on uk manufacturers .
in recent years , all these factors have made survival the priority for some companies , rather than growth .
" in the last three months , we have n't made any money , " says russell luckock , managing director of an engineering company , called a.e. harris .
" we have suffered a 20 % downturn in revenue . "
ian greaves , a partner at kpmg in birmingham , has noticed that the number of receiverships in the midlands has increased sharply in the last six months .
even land rover found itself at the sharp end of this when an insolvent supplier - upf-thomson - threatened to halt production of the discovery vehicle .
land rover is now lobbying the government for a change in the uk 's insolvency laws .
fighting on all sides but it is also dog-eat-dog world in manufacturing - large car manufacturers have been forcing their suppliers to reduce prices for years .
this has forced many suppliers to close up shop .
we are really caught in a vicious loop graham tarbuck peterson spring " we are really caught in a vicious loop , " says graham tarbuck , managing director of a spring company in redditch that supplies the automotive industry .
" the savings that we can offer are exceedingly limited . "
but the common enemy for many manufacturers seems be the government .
many are dismissive of the high-profile campaign by trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt to back manufacturing .
" i have no faith in the government , it 's all talk , talk , " says mr luckock of a.e. harris .
the consensus view is that tony blair 's government is not interested in the sector and continues to heap red tape , in the form of superfluous regulations , on struggling employers .
grass roots workers on the factory floor are also concerned .
john smith , an end-of-line team leader at land rover , says he worries constantly about what will happen to uk manufacturing in the years to come .
if he had his time again , he would not choose a career in manufacturing , he says .
and this is the biggest blow for british industry .
nobody wants to work in the sector anymore .
even land rover has problems recruiting enough graduates , says simon barker , the launch manager for the new range rover .
terry wilkinson , a superintendent at acme whistles , laughs when asked if his two children will consider careers in manufacturing .
" my daughter 's into the performing art ...
and the lad is into computers and things like that , " he says .
at the end of the day , services and it companies could starve manufacturing of the fresh blood and skills it so desperately needs .
and without the right people , like john smith , kamela and errol , manufacturing may lack the wherewithal to reinvent itself and overcome so many other formidable obstacles .
