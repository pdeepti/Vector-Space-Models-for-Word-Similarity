the head of the largest pro-reform faction in parliament , rajabali mazrouei , has condemned the remarks as irresponsible and accused the guards of siding with the conservative faction .
he said more than 90 mps were planning to question the defence minister to explain why the soldiers were intervening in politics - a violation , he said , of the country 's constitution .
in their strongly-worded statement issued on saturday , the guards said they were committed to defending the islamic revolution against what they termed foreign invaders and their internal allies .
' infiltration ' the revolutionary guards are an elite armed force personally responsible to iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah khamenei .
the guards once accused president khatami of creating chaos the guards ' criticism of the reformist faction in the iranian leadership was very harsh indeed .
they accused supporters of president mohammed khatami - without naming them directly - of abandoning the principles of islamic revolution and working to turn iran into a secular state .
their statement said the existence of such a tendency in the islamic regime had encouraged iran 's arch-enemy - the us - to think of a military invasion of the country .
they warned that opponents of the islamic state had infiltrated the regime and were now openly supporting subversion on the streets .
an influential pro-reform newspaper , norouz , asked ayatollah khamenei to make it clear whether he approved the statement by the guards .
but the guards insisted in their statement that they had an ideological duty to defend the islamic regime if it was threatened .
three years ago , a group of guard commanders issued another strongly-worded statement , accusing president khatami of creating chaos in the country by his reform programme .

the lessons to be learned inquiry is expected to highlight ministers ' failure to prepare properly for an outbreak on that scale and to halt the spread of the disease quickly enough .
breakfast spoke to john pratt , a cattle farmer .
he said : " i did not agree with the mass culling , and the not clearing up of dead animals for up to a fortnight .
the smell and pollution was intolerable .
this should never have happened .
i do n't agree on mass culling , we have to agree on mass vaccination .
we should have gone down this route .
vaccination is the way forward . "
we check out the cost to tourism with peter smith who runs a hotel in builth wells .
he said : " we were empty for up to 5 months .
it cost us 16 of our full time staff .
we lost all the big agricultural shows on the grounds and we are only now going to 2000 level .
the revenue we lost in 2002 is lost .
the worst thing that happened is a knee jerk reaction by the welsh assembly who sent out a circular saying there should be no conferenced in mid wales .
it cost 16 people their jobs , and we were in the ludricous situation where people were having to pass our hotel to go outside the area to have their conference and then return past our hotel to go back to their office .
i do n't have confidence that lessons have been learned . "
we also talked to ben gill president of the national farmers union .
the damage done to tourism from the effective closure of the countryside is also likely to be focused on by the last of three independent inquiries into the epidemic .
inquiry 's terms of reference vaccination merits adequacy of contingency plans was government response effective ?
was response justified ?
was farming community prepared ?
and the need to bring in the army sooner will be one of the inquiry 's key recommendations for handling any future outbreak , according to the times newspaper .
this investigation into what went wrong and the lessons that can be learned , chaired by dr iain anderson cbe , included a series of public meetings in areas worst hit by the disease .
but the questioning of government witnesses was in private .
rural affairs secretary margaret beckett will make a statement to the commons at 1530 bst , after which the report will be made public .
army support the anderson report will particularly criticise the government for failing to use the military in the worst affected areas in cumbria and devon until four weeks after the first confirmed case , says the times .
this was despite the fact that the previous official inquiry report into the 1967 outbreak recommended the immediate call-up of the army .
it is anticipated that the report will also highlight on the inadequacy of the contingency plan in place at the outbreak 's onset in february last year .
this was based on there being 10 infected premises when there were at least 57 before diagnosis .
this had risen to more than 2,000 by the time the last case was confirmed in september .
public inquiry the government has been criticised for stopping short of holding a full public inquiry into the outbreak .
it did commission three reports into the handling of the disease .
a scientific report by the royal society into the disease published last week recommended the use of emergency vaccination as an alternative to mass culling .
mass slaughter led to the loss of almost seven million animals and a compensation bill to farmers of £ 1.3bn.
but former agriculture minister nick brown told an eu inquiry farmers had been against vaccination and there had not been enough doses of vaccine .
the first of the three inquiries into the disease - the policy commission on the future of farming and food , chaired by sir don curry , reported its findings in january .

the vessels were passing through a protest flotilla of small yachts in the tasman sea between australia and new zealand when the greenpeace activists attempted to slow them down .
an australian politician jumped in the sea the protesters who jumped into the water included ian cohen , an elected member of the new south wales parliament in australia .
british nuclear fuels plc -lrb- bnfl -rrb- , the owners of the waste , said the act was " lunacy " .
greenpeace claims the ships are carrying enough plutonium waste to make 50 nuclear bombs , which make them a potential target for terrorists .
the radioactive material is being returned to britain because accompanying documentation had been falsified .
more than 50 protesters took part in the nuclear-free seas flotilla .
it consisted of yachts from new zealand , australia and the tiny pacific islands of vanuatu .
they battled high seas and unpredictable weather over the past two days to be ready to confront the two freighters , which left japan on 4 july , in a stretch of water between norfolk island and lord howe island .
greenpeace says the protest was largely a symbolic one , and that it never expected the ships to stop .

in its latest report on the british economy , the ernst & young item club blamed sliding stock markets and the government 's tax policies for the country 's pension crisis .
chancellor gordon brown 's 1997 decision to scrap a tax credit on share dividends boosted the tax take , and was justified at the time by the booming economy .
but today 's slowing economic growth and six-year stock-market lows have made mr brown 's action seem injudicious , the ernst & young item club said .
" his error of judgement has been ruthlessly exposed , " said professor peter spencer , the item club 's economic adviser .
" the chancellor must unpick the damage that he has done before it becomes irreversible . "
mind the gap making pensions obligatory is a perennial theme of pundits , who worry that existing company arrangements will not provide a sufficient safety net for today 's workers .
mr brown was too optimistic , the item club says the country 's unwillingness to save money is not merely seen as irresponsible , but could also damage the economy , forecasters say .
mr spencer pointed out that britain 's pension gap - the difference between what is being put in and what will eventually be needed - is £ 27bn and growing .
in order to help counteract this , the government should bring in incentives for savers , mr spencer argued - especially because returns from most forms of investment are not currently attractive .
of these incentives , reinstating the tax credit on share dividends is seen by the item club as the best way forward .
two speeds merge the item club , meanwhile , is becoming more sanguine about the wider british economy .
describing the country 's economic prospects as " dull and overcast , becoming sunnier " , the club forecasts economic output growth to accelerate from 1.7 % this year to 2.6 % in 2003 .
savers need a reason to invest , pundits warn this trend should be helped by a narrowing of the gap between runaway consumer spending and stagnant manufacturing output , something that has created a so-called " two speed economy " in the uk .
the club forecasts that the current lively state of the housing market will become subdued , but that there should be no " burst bubble " effect .
and as the pound falls against the euro , british industry is set to benefit in terms of international competitiveness .
" providing this fall continues the uk economy will get through the financial market turbulence quite well , with the consequent impact on output and inflation being neutral , " the item club said .
