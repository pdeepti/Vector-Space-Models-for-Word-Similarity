after months of searching for a new ceo , the german telecom giant deutsche telekom may have found its man : kai-uwe ricke , the current head of the company ’ s mobile phone and online division . a four-month long search for a replacement for former deutsche telekom ceo ron summer looks set to end next week .
according to germany ’ s " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper on saturday , senior members of the company ’ s supervisory board have settled on kai-uwe ricke .
sources close to board members told the paper that the interim chief executive helmut sihler had spoken with the board ’ s steering committee and informed them that the search for a suitable candidate for the top job had been completed and that the results would be presented at a meeting on november 14 .
at that time it is expected that the 20 members on the telecom ’ s supervisory board will be asked to endorse or reject ricke .
no alternative candidate has been named .
" in theory there could still be discussions , disputes and surprises , but in practice we expect a unanimous vote , " one of the board members told the " financial times " on friday .
selection from within the 41-year old ricke has been at deutsche telekom since 1998 and currently serves as chief operating officer for the company ’ s mobile phone and online activities .
he is widely regarded among his colleagues as competent , and should have no difficulty receiving votes from the workers ’ representatives , who comprise half of the supervisory board ’ s members and have made no small secret of preferring an internal candidate .
the new ceo will face the monumental task of pushing ahead with restructuring plans , cost-cutting measures and sales boosts to bring the telecom ’ s debt of 64 billion euro -lrb- $ 64.9 billion -rrb- under control .
sihler has already instituted a wide-ranging strategy aimed at cutting debt down to € 50 billion by the end of next year by selling off the company ’ s cable tv assets and downsizing the 240,000 workforce by a fifth .
if elected ceo , ricke says he will not call for more job cuts beyond the 50,000 suggested by sihler .
this has already endeared him to the workers and trade union representatives voting on the board , but may present some difficulty for the investors , who question ricke ’ s ability to define a new strategic direction for the company .
ricke is considered by many of the investors ’ representatives on the board as being too close in thinking to former ceo ron sommer , who hand-picked his protégé to head the mobile operation .
critics point to ricke ’ s firm support for sommer ’ s acquisition of u.s. mobile operator voicestream in 2001 , which is regarded as one of the main contributors to the company ’ s hefty debt .

neither the deutsche telekom nor the german finance ministry , which still holds 43 percent of the former state monopoly ’ s shares , have come out with official statements endorsing ricke as the next chief executive .

"
terrorists can run and they can try to hide overseas - but in the end we will find them and bring them to justice " us attorney general john ashcroft james kilgore , a former member of the symbionese liberation army -lrb- sla -rrb- was reportedly detained at his home in cape town , south africa .
he is wanted in the united states in connection with a 1975 bank robbery and murder .
his arrest comes a day after four other sla members pleaded guilty in a california court to shooting dead a bank customer during a raid .
an fbi spokesman said that mr kilgore was apprehended in the luxury suburb of claremont , and did not resist arrest .
he admitted his identity when challenged by police officers .
false name cape town police spokeswoman mary martins-engelbrecht said mr kilgore , 55 , entered south africa five years ago illegally and had been using the name charles pape .
she said he was working as a lecturer at the university of cape town .
mr kilgore is married and his wife also teaches at the university .
the fbi would not elaborate on exactly how agents tracked down mr kilgore , but said that the case had relied on " good , old-fashioned legwork " .
" terrorists can run and they can try to hide overseas .
but in the end we will find them and bring them to justice , " said us attorney general john ashcroft .
mr kilgore is expected to appear in court in cape town on monday for an extradition hearing .

the extremist urban guerrilla group has long since disbanded , its members renounced its ideology and settled into civilian life .
four of mr kilgore 's former associates made a surprise appearance in a sacramento court on thursday , where they pleaded guilty to the second degree murder of a 42-year-old woman during a robbery at bank in carmichael , california .
the plea means they can expect to receive jail sentences of between six and eight years , instead of facing possible life sentences for first degree murder .
ms hearst , who was also present at that hold-up , would have been a key prosecution witness had the case gone to trial .

some were alleged to have been battered with rifle butts , stabbed with broken bottles and forced to do slave labour .
this treatment is said to have left many mentally scarred and unable to walk again .
last year , the mau mau trust tried to take legal action in kenya , but failed to win the kenyan government 's backing .

it has warned customers to expect above-inflation rises until at least the end of the decade , although it can not yet say by how much .
the region 's water customers already pay the highest water bills in britain at an average of £ 350 .
the likely increases are due to european law which requires more environmental improvements to be carried out .
european legislation is demanding cleaner rivers in particular , rivers must be cleaned up , more wildlife sites protected and drinking water quality improved .
the region has suffered from high water bills in recent years due to the clean sweep programme , introduced to omprove bathing waters .
but with the scheme nearing completion , water customers were hoping to see a reduction in the size of their bills .
however , ofwat says more environmental enhancements required by europe will continue to place a heavy burden on bill payers .
necessary work ofwat has just begun its review of charges from 2005 , and spokesman noel olsen said : " i 'm afraid we are very frightened the bills are going to go up .
" there is an enormous amount of work which the environment agency and others are saying is necessary .
" at the moment that is all going to have to be charged to water customers . "
keith richards , of south west water , said the company saw the need to keep bills as low as possible .
government advice but he said the final decision on further increases would not be taken by them .
" that will be made by the independent regulator ofwat .
" they will be acting on advice from the government as to the pace and timing of environmental improvements , " he said .
a two-year consultation process will now begin , with environmentalists , consumer groups and politicians giving their views .
a final decision on the size of water bills will be made towards the end of 2004 .

a plaque is being put up at torquay 's war memorial to coincide with sunday 's remembrance day ceremony .
until now , only names from world war i have been listed on the war memorial on the town 's seafront .
but now 400 names from world war ii are being placed on the monument after a huge amount of research by local historian and ex-serviceman john pike .
john pike researched the names of the war-dead with the help of a group of fellow former service personnel , he has gathered together as many names as possible .
they have now been engraved on three new bronze plaques .
edna white , who helped in the search for names , said the town should be ashamed it had taken so long to recognise its war-dead .
she said : " the names could have been collected straight after the war .
" admittedly there was so much to do then , but it has taken a long time . "
' surprising ' oversight major jerry yeoman , of the royal british legion , said it was an unusual oversight .
" i know a large number of ex-servicemen were very surprised by this .
" they have attended parades in torquay through the years and never realised the names were n't there . "
it is hoped another plaque will be unveiled next year honouring those who lost their lives in korea , the falklands and the gulf war .
