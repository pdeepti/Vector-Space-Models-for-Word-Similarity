until now he was widely seen as the unwitting victim of his own call for the conservatives to go ' back to basics ' - a succession of sexual scandals amongst ministers followed , helping to fatally weaken his administration .
that was certainly the view of most commentators when he decided to stand down from the commons at the 2001 general election , bringing an end to a remarkable political career .
mr major replaced margaret thatcher as prime minister in 1990 born on 29 march 1943 , mr major grew up in brixton , south london .
he did not enjoy a very illustrious school career and dropped out at the age of 16 .
he soon became interested in local politics and was an active member of the brixton young conservatives .
from 1968 to 1971 he held a seat on lambeth borough council .
he was adopted as prospective conservative parliamentary candidate for huntingdon in may 1976 and elected as its member of parliament in may 1979 from 1981 to 1983 he was a parliamentary private secretary to ministers of state at the home office .
john major 's parliamentary career ' 79 : elected as huntingdon mp ' 81 to ' 83 : parliamentary private secretary to home office ministers ' 83-4 : assistant government whip ' 84-5 : treasury whip ' 85-6 : under-secretary of state for social security ' 86 : minister of state for social security ' 87 : chief secretary to the treasury ' 89 : foreign secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer ' 90- ' 97 : prime minister he then rose quickly through the ranks , first serving as assistant government whip -lrb- 1983-4 -rrb- when the affair with mrs currie began .
the next move was treasury whip -lrb- 1984-5 -rrb- , under-secretary of state for social security -lrb- 1985-6 -rrb- and then minister of state for social security in 1986 .
he became chief secretary to the treasury in 1987 - when the liaison with mrs currie ended - and by 1990 , when michael heseltine and douglas hurd challenged mrs thatcher for the party leadership , he was chancellor .
when mrs thatcher failed to see off the leadership contenders in the first round of voting , mr major announced his candidature and won the leadership .
three months later , in the aftermath of the gulf war , he had become the most popular prime minister in 30 years .
dogged by divisions his style of leadership was a stark contrast to his predecessor 's with mr major running a much more inclusive cabinet .
his successes included reaching agreement with other european nations on the maastricht treaty and bringing about an ira ceasefire in 1994 which laid the foundations for the good friday agreement .
but his premiership was dogged by divisions in his party over europe and accusations of government sleaze .
in june 1995 , stung by criticism of his leadership major took the unprecedented step for a british prime minister of resigning as head of his party , forcing a leadership vote .
although he won the vote he remained deeply unpopular and the party failed to unite behind him .
the party and mr major struggled through to the 1997 general election but it was no surprise when labour swept to power - with the conservatives suffering their heaviest election result of the 20th century mr major announced his decision to relinquish the leadership of the conservative party immediately telling the world it was " time to leave the stage " .
on 19 june 1997 , william hague became the party 's leader and mr major retired to the back benches .
but he still made his voice heard , criticising tory mps who advocated a move further to the right in 1999 , which he said would lose them the election .
and he recently joined the political debate over military action in iraq , drawing on his experience as prime minister during the gulf war .

first , the company 's managing director , mike beasley , declared his pride in launching the model , 34 years to the day after the arrival of the first jaguar xj .
and then the marque 's chief operating officer , bob dover , came driving straight through a hole in the wall in a jag that looked like a stainless steel kitchen that had been bashed and hammered into a streamlined shape and given wheels .
but , of course , there was method to the madness .
lightweight the car had not been sprayed because jaguar wanted to show that its body was largely made up of aluminium and magnesium in an effort to make it both stiffer and lighter than its predecessors .
" two hundred kilograms .
a fifth of a metric tonne .
almost 450 of our english pounds .
two hundred and twenty bags of sugar .
two hundred kilograms is the weight saving we 've achieved with this model , " mr dover said .
" now , that 's some diet , " he said , going on to praise its various attributes in the way only automotive industry executives can .
new engine but while he described the new xj as " the most advanced jaguar ever " , mr dover must have been aware of the calls of the market place .
with looks that are by and large identical to previous models , it seems clear that the xj would need something extra to make it stand out .
and although the weight loss offers improved performance , fuel economy and emission performance , even though the car is taller , wider and longer than its predecessors , it is unlikely that weight alone will do it for the marque .
the d-word instead , jaguar is thinking the unthinkable .
apparently , there are plans to quietly slip a diesel engine under the xj 's lanky bonnet .
to purists , this would be an outrage of course .
" jaguar is not about diesel , " one jaguar official told bbc news online , while another insisted that " there is no diesel engine in this model or in any other jaguar " .
strong demand but commercially it may well make sense .
" they really have to come up with one soon , " an official at one of its competitors said .
jaguar 's response is that as yet none of their cars will be equipped with diesel engines .
though by 2004 , at the earliest , an s-class diesel will hit the market , and the xj may well follow suit , a french official revealed to bbc news online .
" france and italy have been calling for a diesel for years , " he said .
" but the main reason why we are doing it now is because of growing demand in the uk . "
catching up jaguar 's competitors audi , bmw , mercedes have enjoyed great success with their executive diesel models for years .
" when you look to the german car manufacturers now , they are fighting against each other with the biggest statement , with more horse power , and these days a diesel engine car is as powerful as a petrol car , " saab europe 's claude makowski told bbc news online .
saab cottoned on to this just in time , if not even slightly too late , to ride the wave when it launched its first executive diesel 9-5 in 2001 , four years after introducing a smaller 9-3 diesel .
in france , italy and spain , up to 70 % of all executive cars sold have diesel engines , mr makowski said .
lately , the phenomenon has spread to the uk where changes to company car taxation have fuelled demand for executive diesels .
low carbon dioxide emissions are all that matters in the uk at the moment , one british official said .
the germans have been convinced too by technological advances which show that the quality of diesel engines has improved dramatically .
market leader across europe , diesel engines have become incredibly popular , not only in executive models but in small cars as well .
so at the moment , diesel cars outsell petrol cars .
this is good news , according to claude satinet , chief executive of citroen .
" they are completely good , they do n't make any more noise than petrol cars , and the reaction for the driver is exactly the same , " he told bbc news online .
" it 's the only solution to reduce fuel consumption in the short-term . "
less pollution the greater mileage per litre achieved with a diesel car has often made its advocates hail the engines as an environmentally friendly alternative to petrol engines .
but while petrol is a major co2 polluter , diesel is instead releasing a wide range of particles which have been blamed for causing asthma , cancer or worse .
" we say that if you do n't pay attention to petrol engines , you will be poisoned , while if you do n't pay attention to diesel engines you will not be able to breathe , " said saab 's mr makowski .
new filter a solution to diesel 's problems may soon be found , however .
psa peugeot citroen 's chief executive , jean-martin folz , on thursday announced that it has developed a new filter which will soak up virtually all the particles normally released by diesel engines .
" it means our diesel cars are as clean as petrol cars , " mr folz 's sergeant at citroen , mr satinet , said .
" we are hoping that our competitors will have the same solution in a year or so because the only way to get around the criticism of diesel cars is if they are clean . "
in a meeting on friday , executives from all the major car makers agreed to throw their weight behind the development of clean diesel technology .
" current diesel engines are dramatically more efficient than conventional gasoline engines in terms of both fuel economy and carbon dioxide emissions .
" diesel engines also have the potential to meet stringent requirements regarding local emissions , " the automotive executives said in a joint statement .
