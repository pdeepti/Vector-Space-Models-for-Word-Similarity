as hundreds of protesters drifted home , police set up roadblocks to ensure they did not smuggle away the escapee refugees .
police have warned that the asylum seekers could die of dehydration if they flee into the surrounding desert .
they were among 50 detainees who staged a mass break-out on friday and the federal government is now investigating how such an embarrassing breach of security occurred .
clashes about 800 demonstrators marched on woomera , 450 kilometres -lrb- 280 miles -rrb- north-west of adelaide , over the easter weekend and clashed with riot police on horseback .
thirty people have been arrested .
all have received bail , including the condition that they leave woomera and will appear in court on 27 may .
of the escaped refugees , protesters say some of the fugitives have already reached major cities , where they are being harboured by sympathisers .
but there remain concerns for their safety .
superintendent wayne bristow said it was " a tragedy waiting to happen " .
" this is a desert area , these people had no knowledge of it , " he said .
temperatures at this time of year can rise to 30c , falling to below 10c at night .
some of the protesters plan a further demonstration later on monday at the site of another detention centre under construction on the outskirts of port augusta , about 200 km south of woomera .
police under fire immigration minister phillip ruddock has criticised the police for failing to prevent the break-out on friday .
he said those who had escaped would be dealt with by the courts and could face five years in prison , and warned that people harbouring them could face a similar punishment .
the break-out happened after about 1,000 activists crossed a restricted area , ripped down perimeter fences and advanced into the detention centre .
some asylum seekers scaled fences topped with razor wire , while others broke through holes in the perimeter fences .
australia 's prime minister , john howard , said the demonstrations would not change the government 's policy on immigration .
" if anything it will strengthen the resolve of the australian people to support even more the government 's policy , " he said .
and philip ruddock said the government 's tough policy to deter asylum seekers from arriving by boat was succeeding .
he said there had been no new arrivals for five months - the longest such period in four years .
hundreds held over the past two years , detainees at woomera have staged a series of sometimes violent demonstrations , including a hunger strike earlier this year when many of those involved sewed their lips together .
some critics have described woomera as " a concentration camp " .
up to 800 detainees can be held within its razor wire fences while their applications for refugee status are considered .
the process takes a few months on average , but can last up to five years .
more than 300 detainees are currently believed to be in the centre , most of them from afghanistan and iraq .
the government says its policy of mandatory detention of asylum seekers is necessary for security and health reasons .

chief minister narendra modi arrived in delhi as hindu-muslim clashes continued in gujarat , just days before a proposed visit by mr vajpayee - his first since the riots began in february .
more than 700 people have been killed in the violence and mr modi 's administration has been severely criticised by opposition parties as well as india 's human rights commission for failing to contain the bloodshed .
the violence has spilled into neighbouring maharashtra state , where seven people are now reported to have died officials in the main city of ahmedabad said 50 buildings were set ablaze during street clashes between hindu and muslim groups on sunday .
at least nine people have been killed in the state since saturday .
curfews are in force in several areas and paramilitary police are patrolling the streets .
in maharashtra , the authorities have ordered a judicial inquiry into religious clashes in the town of akola over the weekend .
the violence broke out during the hindu religious festival of holi , prompting the police to open fire in the town , some 300 kilometres east of the state capital bombay .
modi under fire mr modi , who belongs to the prime minister 's hindu nationalist bharatiya janata party -lrb- bjp -rrb- , has faced widespread calls for his resignation .
opposition politicians have alleged the state government did little to stop hindu gangs from destroying muslim property and mosques in what some say was clearly a pre-planned operation .
mr modi has denied the allegations .
on saturday , he told investors in bombay that gujarat , one of the most prosperous indian states , was fast returning to normal .

it was n't worth the damage to my reputation , but that does n't mean the attacks were true , " he said .
the former president also told the magazine that osama bin laden was conspiring to assassinate him .
controversy marc rich , a commodities trader , is alleged to have evaded more than $ 48m worth of income taxes and to have illegally bought oil from iran during the 1979 hostage crisis .
his ex-wife denise lobbied intensely for his pardon , and the us attorney 's office for new york 's southern district is currently investigating whether mr rich 's pardon , and others , were bought with political donations and personal gifts . "

in return , the cree are allowing environmental assessments to start on a huge new hydro project .
the deal cree get s $ 2.2bn in quebec funds all cree legal claims are dropped dam creates 8,000 construction jobs work starts in 2004-2005 quebec also gets forestry and mining rights for the first time , the cree will receive at least $ 44m a year for the first 50 years of this agreement , including royalties from the hydro projects on their ancestral lands that generate over half quebec 's electricity , and from forestry and logging .
but many cree are angry that hundreds of square kilometres of hunting land will be flooded .
sacred land this new agreement between the cree and the quebec government was negotiated in secrecy between the leaders on both sides .
when it was announced , it was a shock to most of those in the 12,000-strong cree nation . "
i do n't see this as betrayal .
the fact is , a lot of those young people do n't live off the land , and trying to live off the land is not economically viable any more " former chief of chisasibi , violet pachanos many felt that it went against their belief that the land is sacred and must not be harmed .
" the land is the base of our strength , and if we give up too much , there might not be enough to use to protect the land that might be left there , " said abraham rupert , the chief of chisasibi .
in the recent referendum on the agreement , chisasibi was the only community to vote against it .
the deal was approved - although with a low turnout only a minority of the cree actually voted in favour .
the cree leadership successfully argued that the agreement protects much of their land while allowing the quebec government to divert a river and flood hundreds of square kilometres of hunting-grounds to boost production in the existing la grande complex of dams near chisasibi .
betrayal the cree have spent decades fighting against proposals to build more hydro schemes on their land , and many feel they have now been betrayed by their leaders .
but the former chief of chisasibi , violet pachanos , disagrees : " i do n't see this as betrayal .
the fact is , a lot of those young people do n't live off the land , and trying to live off the land is not economically viable any more , " she said .
until very recently , the cree were a nomadic hunting people , but in the last few decades they have settled into communities with modern houses and services .
many are battling to cope with that transformation , and jobs are scarce .
the new money will make a material difference , but many cree fear that the connection to their ancestral lands may be weakening .
