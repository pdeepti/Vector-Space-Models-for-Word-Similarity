mr blair said it would be wrong to shut down the british nuclear fuels plant in cumbria , without official evidence to back up claims it posed a threat .
he was responding to sdlp leader john hume in the house of commons , after the irish mp asked mr blair if he was aware of the widespread concerns about the plant .
there are fears in the uk and ireland sellafield might be leaking nuclear pollution into the irish sea .
' strict standards ' the wife of u2 pop singer bono is spearheading a protest campaign against the plant .
speaking on wednesday , mr blair said : " i am aware of the concern that is expressed .
" however , the sellafield plant , and indeed any other plant in this country , is subject to the strictest , not just national but international , standards . "
he said the plant is regularly inspected and none of the types of problems alleged by campaigners have been found .
mr blair said : " of course we take these concerns seriously , but there is a proper procedure .

with its manicured lawns , tasteful houses and hedge-lined roads , halfpenny green would appear an unlikely setting for a battleground .
but now the picturesque village is set to become the frontline in a clash which could be played out in other areas across the uk .
for next to halfpenny green lies an aerodrome - and while its windswept runway and spartan buildings provide little indication of its surging ambition , the site could soon become an international airport for wolverhampton .
and with passenger numbers potentially soaring to one million every year , neighbours fear their ears could be in for a bashing .
wolverhampton airport would be transformed " there will be more noise , more pollution , more traffic on the roads , " said norman jones , chairman of the local parish council .
" we will have medium-sized passenger jets in the air day-in day-out .
we will completely lose our tranquility and privacy .
" we would hope that the existing major airports can take all the extra passengers they can and that the overspill is not too large . "
he points to bristol as one of the airports that could be expanded .
indeed , with the number of passengers using uk airports set to double over the next 20 years to more than 400 million a year , more and more small aerodromes could try to cash in on the boom .
it 's a nightmare , the noise shakes the place to pieces , it makes life very stressful airport neighbour jo lucas it is estimated up to 25 airports across the uk will need to expand to meet the demand , from well-established airports like birmingham and bristol to smaller hubs like norwich and sheffield .
developers say the expansion is unstoppable and will create thousands of jobs , but homeowners fear that life under a flight path will become unbearable .
about £ 12m is being earmarked by developers to expand wolverhampton business airport , six miles east of the city .
although currently home to a fleet of small jets , its owners hope to create a small terminal for holidaymakers and business travellers .
journey time cut proposals for the new facilities include a 60-seat restaurant .
developers hope to fly 100-seater passenger jets to destinations like london , edinburgh , brussels and malaga .
chairman of the airport graham silk estimates the airport would create or maintain 12,000 jobs and predicts that up to 25 airports across the country will need to expand to match the demand .
" it will cut the four-hour train journey to london to an hour-and-a-half from office to office , " he said .
residents fear their tranquillity will disappear yet in bristol , which already boasts a thriving small airport , it is not an idea that gets the support of jo lucas .
she lives with dozens of airplanes flying at 300 feet over her house each day as they take-off from bristol international airport .
" it 's a nightmare , the noise shakes the place to pieces , it makes life very stressful , " she said .
she has been unable to sell her bungalow , despite dropping the price by £ 70,000 .
" we 're trapped , there is nothing we can do about it , " she said .
" i do n't believe anyone who tells us that residents ' views are being considered , they are n't .
" i just hope that other people do n't get an airport near them because it will make their lives a misery . "
tourism boost but paul morgan , who runs a hotel next to the airstrip near wolverhampton , can see the benefits .
" as long as adequate measures are taken to reduce the noise the effects could be quite negligible , " he said .
" the airport could open up the tourism business for south staffordshire . "
the government is set to publish a consultation paper later this year considering the expansion of regional airports and plans to outline its proposals for legislation by the end of the year .

pre-tax profits were down 9 % to £ 11.6m -lrb- $ 16.9m -rrb- , and the company said it still had " operational issues " to resolve .
body shop founder anita roddick , who became one of the uk 's most high-profile businesswomen as the store chain rose to prominence in the 1980s , stepped down in february after talks with potential buyers for the company ended .
sales at stores open at least a year fell 2 % during the first seven weeks of 2002 , the store said as it published its 2001 results on thursday .
strong competition " the 2002 financial results were disappointing , not so much in the aggregate but more in the missed opportunity , " executive chairman adrian bellamy said in a statement .
" the single most important priority is to improve comparable store sales performance across the business through the introduction of new product ... to drive higher conversion of customer traffic into sales . "
the chain , which built its reputation on selling products not tested on animals and exotic herbal toiletries , has seen its market challenged in recent years as mainstream competitors adopted similar tactics .
last year , talks with mexican nutritional supplements specialist grupo omnilife , who were reported to be putting together a £ 300m offer for body shop , came to nothing .
the body shop owns about 500 stores in 50 countries , and also runs a network of international franchised outlets .

live racing coverage from the uk 's 49 top courses was due to end on tuesday , after the racecourse association 's -lrb- rca -rrb- annual general meeting rejected an offer from bookmakers .
but that deadline was extended for one day as talks continued , and on wednesday night a deal in principle was agreed .
full details of the new deal are expected to be released later this week .
this agreement is good news for the whole industry keith brown , chairman of the rca keith brown , chairman of the rca , said : " this agreement is good news for the whole industry as it protects income which would certainly have suffered otherwise . "
the rca at negotiations last week dropped its cash demand from the equivalent of £ 5,000 per betting office , while the bookmakers increased their offer by £ 100 per outlet .
bookmakers had threatened to ditch uk racing in favour of screening irish , south african , italian and us meetings , plus greyhound racing , if racecourse chiefs held out for too high a fee .
the deal means coverage of thursday 's racing at brighton , redcar and southwell , which had been due to be pulled from screens , will now go ahead .
digital rival bookmakers ladbrokes said they were " delighted " agreement had been reached .
christopher bell , chief executive officer of ladbrokes worldwide , said : " i am very pleased to have been able to agree a commercially sound deal with the racecourses , based on our ability to pay .
" i am now looking forward to working together with the racing industry to realise the opportunity this agreement gives us to maximise the profitability of all of our businesses . "
the deal comes as racing channel attheraces was launched over the sky digital network .
the channel has been backed by sky , channel 4 and racecourse owner arena leisure .

seven counts ms gehring , a biology teacher , was ordered to pay £ 4,300 in costs at the hearing in toronto on wednesday .
she was found guilty of seven counts of professional misconduct , including abusing students " physically , sexually , verbally , psychologically or emotionally " .
the tribunal also said she had failed to uphold the profession 's standards , had improperly disclosed information about a student and had behaved in a way that could be viewed as " disgraceful , dishonourable or unprofessional " .
ms gehring 's ban will not automatically apply to the uk , although information on teachers who have been banned by the toronto college is shared with british education authorities .
the college ruled ms gehring could not reapply for a teaching certificate for 10 years , after which she must then have a psychological assessment to prove she is no longer a risk to pupils .

the timeplan company , which employed and brought ms gehring to the uk , faced scrutiny in the wake of the court case earlier this year .

bbc news online 's darren waters looks at the increased competition in the marketplace .
let battle commence .
sony , microsoft and nintendo are the key figures in a struggle for supremacy in the $ 20bn computer games market .
microsoft 's xbox , nintendo 's gamecube and sony 's playstation 2 represent the next generation of console gaming with cd quality sound , photo-real images and the ability to connect to the internet for multi-player online gaming .
the three machines have differing specifications , prices and capabilities and the consumer now has a difficult choice to make .
the three companies hope simply that the market place is big enough to accommodate their console and for the video game fan there has never been a better time to indulge their hobby .
sony is the market leader , with more than 28 million playstation 2 consoles and its teething problems at launch now seem a long time ago with titles such as metal gear solid 2 impressing fans and critics alike .
european launch xbox has launched successfully in the us , and despite some problems in japan , there are now more than three million of microsoft 's consoles in the market .
the european launch on 14 march pushed that figure up and the company hopes to ship between four and six million by the middle of the year .
reports of slow sales in japan and europe prompted the xbox to drop its price to £ 199 , a price which puts its head to head with sony .
nintendo is playing catch-up but is counting on the loyalty of the millions of owners of gameboy advance hand-held consoles .
a pre-launch price cut in europe in £ 129 makes it the cheapest of the three consoles and its launch line-up of games makes a strong package .
paul jackson , managing director of giant software firm electronic arts , said the gamecube was a welcome addition to the market .
" we are a software producer and want to produce games for any console format we think is going to have significant presence in the market . "
the company is producing many of its key titles - including fifa world cup 2002 - for the machine .
" gamecube is a nice looking machine and also a powerful machine . "
while xbox is accept to be the most powerful of the consoles everyone recognises this may not be enough of an edge to win the day .
david mccarthy , news editor of the edge maazine , said : " everyone goes on about the raw power of xbox .
i am not entirely convinced about that argument .
' quality ' " it is about games and xbox has four or five games - halo , amped , dead or alive 3 for example - that make me want to buy it . "
david gosen , managing director of nintendo europe , agreed that it was software not hardware which was important .
" ultimately , the consumer will decide which company is successful or not .
the key determinant is the quality of the games .
" it is not about the technology or how many polygons it can shift across the screen , it is the gaming experience . "
sony 's original console , the playstation , proved that games console were not only attractive to children and to teenagers and some surveys state that up to a quarter of all us households have one .
joe fielder , editor of gamespot , said : " i think the market has grown over the last 10 years .
gamers have got older having grown up with computer games .
' older gamers ' " the age range for games players has really increased and the three systems carve up that range .
" nintendo is for younger games , ps2 for teenagers and xbox for slightly older gamers . "
but mr gosen disagrees : " we believe gaming is an attitude not an age .
we want to make sure our games appeal to all ages . "
" it is considerably more difficult for microsoft than it was for sony when it released the ps2 , " said mccarthy " it was a relatively open playing field for sony then .
but microsoft is used to tough challenges . "

the international monetary fund chief has held out the prospect of new financial help for the conflict-torn democratic republic of congo . "
output per person is $ 85 per year - lower than in 1990 . "
imf assessment speaking during a six hour visit to the capital , kinshasa , the imf 's managing director horst koehler also said he thinks that the country 's foreign debt will not be a problem .
he said he thinks congo will qualify for extensive debt relief under a scheme run by the imf and the world bank .
debt problems congo owes a total of $ 13bn -lrb- £ 8.2bn -rrb- to the imf and other creditors .
it was built up during the cold war years when the country , then known as zaire , was run by the kleptocratic dictator mobutu sese seko .
but the country has been cut off from the imf and the world bank since the early 1990s .
it 's widely thought that western donors knew perfectly well that their aid money was being pillaged by the previous regime .
speaking at a press conference in kinshasa , mr koehler acknowledged that the imf was open to criticism for its role in the country 's unhappy history .
but he said he wants to help the congolese people overcome the difficult situation they have been living through for so long .
aid promises mr koehler gave no figures for debt relief or imf financial assistance .
but the congolese economy and finance minister matungulu mbayamu ilankir told the bbc that he anticipates $ 10bn -lrb- £ 6bn -rrb- worth of debt relief .
on the unhappy history of the debt , he said that many congolese people feel they were abandoned by the rich countries after the cold war .
but he wants to think more about the future .
economic decline first , however , congo will have to perform to the imf 's satisfaction in terms of economic reforms .
it is likely to get new soft loans during this period .
the imf lending that mr koehler held out would be under an arrangement called the poverty reduction and growth facility .
mr matungulu said that is likely to be $ 730m .
once that has been agreed , probably in a few months , he said the world bank and rich country governments are likely to chip in .
total loans , including the imf 's would be approaching $ 3bn .
a recent assessment by the imf said that since 1990 , the congo economy had suffered a vicious spiral due to economic mismanagement , political conflict and war with the result that the economy is now smaller than it was then .
in 2000 , the imf said , output per person was equivalent to just $ 85 a year , or 23 cents a day .

the three-year astrogrid project is attempting to give astronomers a common way of accessing and manipulating diverse data archives .
the project will also help scientists cope with the wave of data that novel telescopes and instruments are expected to generate .
the researchers behind the initiative believe astronomers will only be able to do meaningful science with this wealth of new data by tapping the net 's huge information processing potential .
day-to-day data delay astrogrid is a £ 5m project that attempts to put a single , friendly interface on the huge number of astronomical archives and data sets currently held online .
it is one of many projects inspired by research on ways of using the computers attached to the net as a coupled supercomputer or a storage system with almost limitless capacity .
the grid could help with forecasts of space weather nicholas walton , project scientist for astrogrid , said many astronomers currently spent a lot of their time hunting for data or turning what they needed into a form they could use .
" data sets are archived but not always in the same format or in a way that 's accessible to all , " said dr walton .
astrogrid will create a standard way of querying almost any astronomical database and remove any need to understand the technical quirks of an instrument to get the most out of the information .
to make this happen , the astrogrid project is defining a " metadata " format that can be used to interpret sets of data so they can be queried through one interface similar to a web browser .
we want to enable astronomers to do more effective and economic science dr nicholas walton , astrogrid " we want to make it easier for everyone to have access to the same data but ensure they 're presented in the same uniform way , " said dr walton .
" we 'll have been successful when they are using it but do n't know they are using it , " he said .
the ability to combine datasets from different sources was becoming much more important to astronomers , said dr walton .
only by combining x-ray , radio , magnetic , infra-red and optical information about astronomical objects such as supernova remnants would scientists get a thorough understanding of the universe , he said .
instrument explosion astrogrid will also help astronomers cope with the enormous amounts of data that new instruments , such as the visible & infrared survey telescope for astronomy -lrb- vista -rrb- , are expected to produce .
telescope arrays generate huge amounts of data dr walton said that before now total surveys of the sky were typically done once every few decades .
by contrast , vista will survey the sky every few days and produce 100gb of data per night .
other planned instruments such as europe 's very large telescope array and the american space agency 's living with a star project will produce similar reams of data .
the only way that astronomers were going to be able to archive and analyse such enormous amounts of data was by using the net as a storage system and a vast supercomputer , said dr walton .
without the help of the internet , scientists would have no chance of finding the tens of objects that interest them out of the billions that instruments are recording information about .
" we want to enable astronomers to do more effective and economic science , " he said .
" we want them to do the things they do now faster and to do things they can not contemplate now . "

"
we have given the call for a peaceful strike and condemn these blasts and violence " mqm official nasreen jalil the 12-year-old boy , shamsur rehman , was killed when a bomb exploded in a shop in an eastern suburb on thursday .
reports said six family members were wounded .
a second bomb exploded in a market in a southern karachi neighbourhood , damaging some cars parked nearby .
the blasts followed two explosions late on wednesday in different market areas of the city , which wounded at least 18 people , police said .
the violence coincided with a strike called by the ethnic muttahida qaumi movement -lrb- mqm -rrb- in protest at the murder of two of its members last week .
mob violence according to the associated press news agency , groups of masked men roamed the city overnight , stopping at least 12 vehicles , ordering people to get out , then setting them on fire .
soldiers and paramilitary troops were deployed to restore calm and help maintain the peace during thursday 's strike .

uk cable operator telewest has said it plans to cut 1,500 jobs in an effort to save up to £ 50m -lrb- $ 73m -rrb- over the next 12 months .
the layoffs were " a necessary but painful response to market conditions " in order to stabilise the firm 's financial future , said chief executive adam singer .
we are in a climate in which capital is scarce and we have to respond to that adam singer , chief executive most of the job cuts - 14 % of the company 's total workforce - will come from network operations .
the consumer and business divisions will be merged to streamline the company .
figures for the first three months of this year suggest telewest 's business is gaining strength , with increases in revenue and a reduction in net losses .
but investors remained unconvinced .
telewest shares are slumped near all-time lows , standing at 9.4p in thursday trading , down 1.1p on the day and more than £ 5.50 , or 98 % , down on their tech boom peak .
debt worries both telewest and rival uk cable operator ntl ran up hefty debts to develop their networks , which deliver a mix of cable tv , internet and phone services .
investors have recently become anxious about the level of debt and have been voting with their feet by selling the shares .
ntl is in the midst of pulling together a restructuring of its $ 17bn of debt under which bondholders would accept shares in the company but many are not happy and the firm has held talks this week to keep the deal together .
ntl 's debt-for-equity swap has sparked rumours that telewest may opt for a similar solution for its debts of £ 5.3bn.
telewest 's chief executive stressed the job cuts and the firm 's plans to slice £ 50m off capital expenditure were to convince investors it was serious about sorting out its finances .
" despite good operational improvement , we recognise the capital markets -lsb- have -rsb- doubts about the sector and ... require us to do even more , " said mr singer .
" we are in a climate in which capital is scarce and we have to respond to that . "
losses narrow core profits for the first three months of 2002 rose 34 % to £ 91m , compared with £ 68m in the january-to-march period of last year .
telewest reduced its net loss for the period to £ 166m from £ 209m a year earlier .
this figure includes a number of items excluded from the " core " figure .
sales grew 4 % to £ 334m , but revenue from potentially lucrative business customers fell 6 % .
domestic customers yielded 11 % more revenue than a year ago .
average monthly revenue per household climbed to £ 41.97 , its highest ever level .
telewest has 1.78 million domestic subscribers .
its blueyonder broadband internet service gained 27,000 subscribers in april and has 148,000 altogether .
fragile attention on the cable companies has increased following the collapse of digital terrestrial broadcaster itv digital .
this leaves the fragile cable company businesses as the only existing rival in the digital tv sector to rupert murdoch 's bskyb , analysts have said .

the publication of the challenging document known unofficially as the burns report has kicked off an unprecedented discussion on the future of post-primary education in northern ireland .
a team led by former ombudsman gerry burns drew up the proposals .
they originally thought that having reached unanimous agreement among their group the wider population would soon see the virtues of the package .
not so .
all who have commented say they appreciate the motives and the general aims of the report , but the " devil is in the detail " .
some of the issues have caused much disquiet . "
about a third of the pupils go to grammar schools , with the rest going to secondary schools " to recap : this is a proposed solution to the acknowledged problems in deciding to which schools pupils should transfer after primary school .
at the moment , about three quarters of the age group sit the 11-plus tests .
the top grades may win coveted places in the academic hot houses - the grammar schools .
about a third of the pupils go to grammar schools , with the rest going to secondary schools .
academic selection the vast majority of those in grammar schools are from non-manual working backgrounds .
the majority in secondary schools are from manual backgrounds . "
the grammar schools are told they can remain specialist schools for the academically gifted " that social division is one issue the burns team tried to address .
the burns package would alter the power base of the grammar schools .
it would mean : the 11-plus would be scrapped and no academic selection would be permitted a pupil profile compiled throughout primary school would help parents choose the best route for their child but would not be available to post primary schools choosing pupils , because that could be used for selecting on academic grounds schools would be grouped together in area clusters called collegiates which would be expected to co-operate and allow pupils to swap from one to the other , either permanently or for occasional classes .
the most active campaign on the burns proposals has come from the massed opposition of the grammar school lobby .
they have a number of objections : the grammar schools would probably have more applications than places , so they would have to choose between them , without using high exam grades as a deciding factor as the proposals stand , children living nearest to a school would get priority that has brought accusations of " selection by postcode " , and estate agents are expecting increased demand for houses close to popular schools .
' unwieldy and unworkable ' the grammar schools are told they can remain specialist schools for the academically gifted , but if they are forced to take in all abilities , they will have to change their teaching approach . "
it now looks as though most of their proposals are open to amendment " that would , they say , mean lowering their academic expectations .
secondary schools are broadly in favour of the changes , because they feel grammar schools are poaching the best , and more recently , even the middle-range pupils .
but even those schools are concerned that the collegiate system is unwieldy and unworkable .
the consultation will continue until the end of june , and it is now predicted that the burns proposals will not be accepted in their entirety .
from a starting position of the burns team saying there should be no " cherry picking " , it now looks as though most of their proposals are open to amendment .

the publication of the challenging document known unofficially as the burns report has kicked off an unprecedented discussion on the future of post-primary education in northern ireland .
a team led by former ombudsman gerry burns drew up the proposals .
they originally thought that having reached unanimous agreement among their group the wider population would soon see the virtues of the package .
not so .
all who have commented say they appreciate the motives and the general aims of the report , but the " devil is in the detail " .
some of the issues have caused much disquiet .
about a third of the pupils go to grammar schools , with the rest going to secondary schools to recap : this is a proposed solution to the acknowledged problems in deciding to which schools pupils should transfer after primary school .
at the moment , about three quarters of the age group sit the 11-plus tests .
the top grades may win coveted places in the academic hot houses - the grammar schools .
about a third of the pupils go to grammar schools , with the rest going to secondary schools .
academic selection the vast majority of those in grammar schools are from non-manual working backgrounds .
the majority in secondary schools are from manual backgrounds .
the grammar schools are told they can remain specialist schools for the academically gifted that social division is one issue the burns team tried to address .
the burns package would alter the power base of the grammar schools .
it would mean : the 11-plus would be scrapped and no academic selection would be permitted a pupil profile compiled throughout primary school would help parents choose the best route for their child but would not be available to post primary schools choosing pupils , because that could be used for selecting on academic grounds schools would be grouped together in area clusters called collegiates which would be expected to co-operate and allow pupils to swap from one to the other , either permanently or for occasional classes .
the most active campaign on the burns proposals has come from the massed opposition of the grammar school lobby .
they have a number of objections : the grammar schools would probably have more applications than places , so they would have to choose between them , without using high exam grades as a deciding factor as the proposals stand , children living nearest to a school would get priority that has brought accusations of " selection by postcode " , and estate agents are expecting increased demand for houses close to popular schools .
' unwieldy and unworkable ' the grammar schools are told they can remain specialist schools for the academically gifted , but if they are forced to take in all abilities , they will have to change their teaching approach .
it now looks as though most of their proposals are open to amendment that would , they say , mean lowering their academic expectations .
secondary schools are broadly in favour of the changes , because they feel grammar schools are poaching the best , and more recently , even the middle-range pupils .
but even those schools are concerned that the collegiate system is unwieldy and unworkable .
the consultation will continue until the end of june , and it is now predicted that the burns proposals will not be accepted in their entirety .
from a starting position of the burns team saying there should be no " cherry picking " , it now looks as though most of their proposals are open to amendment .
this may be the only way to reach the consensus necessary for major changes to go ahead .

the new york times calls him china 's " mystery man " , noting that his trip is " an essential coming out " .
the newspaper has been looking for clues as to what type of president he might make .
hu 's official biography boasts that he has a photographic memory but no one in washington formed lasting impressions usa today " he comes across as blandly modern - never seen with a hair out of place and never speaking out of turn , " the paper says .
it says mr hu sounds " more like a policy expert that a politician " , noting that he answered a journalist 's question on unemployment with a 15 minute explanation of farming , urbanisation and labour policies .
the washington post reports that mr hu tends to speak in complete paragraphs without notes .
he is famed for his precise memory , the paper says .
the post notes that mr hu 's visit to washington resembled a state visit , with motorcades and high-level meetings .
however it points out that mr hu did not get a " fancy white house dinner " .
even so , the welcome given to the chinese vice-president is highly significant , says the post , since mr hu is expected to take over the presidency when jiang zemin retires next year .
his chinese handlers ... have wrapped him in a cocoon washington post but the newspaper reports that the leadership job is not in the bag for mr hu , who has given no interviews during his trip .
" his chinese handlers , fearing that a mis-step could open him up to allegations at home of being too pro-american , have wrapped him in a cocoon , " the paper reports .
the new york times makes the point that mr hu has never previously visited the us , perhaps for " tactical reasons " while he was climbing the political ladder .
but it does observe that one of his children attended graduate school in new york , though under an assumed name .
usa today says mr hu 's visit has shed little light on what he believes .
it says us officials and members of congress who met mr hu described him as cautious and said he echoed the official chinese line .
" hu 's official biography boasts that he has a photographic memory ... but no one in washington formed lasting impressions , " the paper says .

but it is not all green pastures for the sheep farming industry .
a severe drought and rising returns from dairy and forestry are enticing farmers to diversify into other land uses .
in the past two decades sheep numbers have fallen from 70 million in 1982 to around 40 million now .
the big question is whether sheep farming in new zealand is going out of fashion .
sheep census counting sheep might be an activity best left to insomniacs , but when they are a key part of the national economy it is a serious business .
activity for insomniacs : counting sheep the sheep industry is worth $ 2bn a year to new zealand , so every animal counts .
since the last livestock census in 1996 there has been much heated debate about how many sheep are actually in the fields .
nick nicholson , chairman of the wool exporters association , thinks numbers have fallen far below the official estimates .
" our economic service has had a very very good record at predicting it , but i think the last couple of years they have been well off track , " he said .
" i think the drop has been much more significant and particularly in the last 12-18 months we have seen some big drought areas in new zealand and farmers have had to drop capital stock . "
waiting to come in just how much numbers have dropped is the source of all the controversy .
the wool exporters say there are only around 38 million sheep left in new zealand .
the statisticians are holding firm at 44 million .
sheep sculptures still dominate the roadside so , where are the missing 6 million sheep ?
tony brennan from the new zealand wool board economic service is adamant they are still out there ... somewhere .
" what we 've got is we 've got a situation with a very wet season .
the sheep are very slow to get shorn because they 're wet .
the quality of the grass with lack of sunlight has n't been up to standard .
so the lambs are n't coming forward to the works and the whole season 's been late .
but we 'll get there eventually . "
all change now is a period of rapid change for the industry as farmers increasingly choose other land uses over the notoriously tough life of a sheep farmer .
conventional wisdom has it that farmers in new zealand grow grass for a living .
they then just find the most suitable animals to eat it .
but the sheep is still king .
with annual wool exports of us $ 330m , the importance of sheep is evident everywhere in the rural economy , from playground rides to towering sculptures by the roadside .
new zealand will still be making its living off the sheep 's back for quite some time to come .

the man rolling around the rooftop high above the city streets appears at first to be holding a small parcel .
but it soon becomes clear that the object in his arms is in fact a small child , no older than two .
the child is his son and he 's a drug-crazed addict intent on ending both their lives .
then through a hole in the roof clamber two desperate-looking rescuers .
they rugby-tackle the drug addict , wrestling the child away , everybody rolling precariously on the sloping roof .
a fall will kill them all .
at one point the rescued baby is dropped on the roof , sending him skidding back into the arms of the madman , before again being retrieved .
welcome to the world of crazy medicine , a world in which a pernicious form of speed has taken grip .
it 's a world only too obviously evident if you go to thailand where the narcotic - locally known as yaba - is every drug-taker 's favourite tipple at present .
where did yaba come from ?
the nazis created the stimulant to keep the troops awake for days during wwii thailand is just the latest country to suffer - japan and the us have been here already .
the authorities say the drug is spreading like a tidal wave across the world .

the man rolling around the rooftop high above the city streets appears at first to be holding a small parcel .
but it soon becomes clear that the object in his arms is in fact a small child , no older than two .
the child is his son and he 's a drug-crazed addict intent on ending both their lives .
the drug-addled father restrained by his relatives then through a hole in the roof clamber two desperate-looking rescuers .
they rugby-tackle the drug addict , wrestling the child away , everybody rolling precariously on the sloping roof .
a fall will kill them all .
at one point the rescued baby is dropped on the roof , sending him skidding back into the arms of the madman , before again being retrieved .
welcome to the world of crazy medicine , a world in which a pernicious form of speed has taken grip .
it 's a world only too obviously evident if you go to thailand where the narcotic - locally known as yaba - is every drug-taker 's favourite tipple at present .
where did yaba come from ?

extra police officers have been on duty in london , paris , sydney and berlin , amid fears that there may be a " hardcore " intent on violence .
those taking part in the may day events this year include the trades union congress and the socialist umbrella group globalise resistance .
organisers say the two groups are increasingly coming together on issues such as privatisation , third-world debt and the environment .
what can may day street protests achieve in your opinion ?
have you been involved in or seen any protests taking place ?
nick dearden of socialist umbrella group globalise resistance took your questions in a live forum for the bbc 's six o 'clock news , presented by manisha tank .
transcript manisha tank : may day is increasingly becoming synonymous with protest , often of the anti-capitalist type .
but do these protests just wreak more havoc on what already seems to be a rather crazy world .
you 've been sending in your questions and your comments on the subject and here to answer them is nick dearden of the socialist umbrella group or some would say , anti-capitalist group - globalise resistance .
nick thanks for coming in .
i know that you 've been at the protest this year but there was a marked difference between this year and last year and you were at those also .
nick dearden : absolutely .
this year it was an extremely celebratory atmosphere - very colourful - there were bands playing .
but the big difference was that we had a march in conjunction with the trade union movement , in conjunction with people who were worried about the effects of globalisation in this country as well as people who were worried about the international situation and people making those links and that 's a really new thing .
manisha tank : so in turn you are saying that it was a colourful protest this year - it was more of a celebration of people coming together .
joe gibson , england emails : i just want to congratulate nick and globalise resistance on a joyous , peaceful march .
the weather was glorious and arriving at trafalgar square to the strains of steel drums was a treat .
nick dearden : fantastic - that 's absolutely how i felt as well .
it was wonderful to get up - it was sunny weather - everybody was there , obviously very angry about what 's happening in the world , angry about what 's happening in this country .
but i feel quite pleased to so many other people who agreed with us and who were saying that were going to do something about this .
manisha tank : although there were some who were very happy to be out there , there were others that perhaps disagree .
rob , uk : are n't these demonstrations irrelevant ?
we will all have to go back to spending our money in the same shops tomorrow .
i think making the point that none of us can get away from capitalism as an idea .
nick dearden : well if you look at how social changes happened throughout history , it 's basically like this - it 's building mass movements , it 's large actions , large demonstrations of people who say - we 're not going to put up with this anymore - we 're not going to put up with a world where basically you have the american president spending as much on his military budget as could basically feed everybody in the world , clothe everybody in the world , create a decent world , this year alone .
people are fed up with these contradictions and that 's how things have changed .
that 's how we 're able to sit here in the studio today , people are able to watch tv at home , through people who 've gone out on the streets in the past and done exactly this sort of thing and made it a celebration of that as well .
manisha tank : in a way huw thomas in the uk sort of agrees with you - he asks : is your organisation itself not a product of capitalism ?
the organisation would not succeed without using the internet , and hence the platform provided by microsoft .
practice what you preach is a phrase which comes to mind .
nick dearden : well we use any technology that 's created in order to further us or to further a better world for everybody - we 're not anti-technology by any manner of means .
we say that technological improvements throughout history have made it possible for people to live in the west to a reasonable living standard .
we want to basically globalise that living standard - we want to use technology to make people 's lives better rather than just to enrich the few .
manisha tank : another email here from david feehan , in the uk - again attacking groups like yours and asks : your groups are a pathetic attempt to undermine what has given countries like ours a strong economic foothold in the world today .
would you prefer it if we all lived in countries barely out of the stone age ?
this is a lot to do with the perceptions of your groups .
nick dearden : we 'd prefer it if western countries with specifically large corporations and the elites in western countries would stop going into the developing world and taking food , taking out basic resources , enriching themselves and leaving people starving .
why is it that in the year 2002 we have 28 million people on the starvation line in africa when food is being shipped out of those countries every year in order to make a profit in the west , where food is being dumped in the sea to keep its prices high ?
this is the sort of crazy world that we live in and we 're basically saying - in conjunction with those people in the developing world , because there are millions of people marching today all over the world in a really global movement which is what makes this so exciting - that we 're not going to tolerate this any longer .
manisha tank : we have a text message from andy : why are n't these protesters at work ?
nick dearden : well i took a holiday and i think a lot of people did as well .
many in the trades unions have holidays today but everybody i know took a holiday .
manisha tank : simon wood , bradford , uk : given the increase in people who attend these events , do you think that the mass media can accurately report on them , or does it sensationalise the acts of a minority of trouble makers ?
nick dearden : well it does of course - i was watching the bulletin early and i was very pleased to see that it was made clear that it was a minority of people who were causing trouble .
but i was standing in trafalgar square and literally i 'd marched from clerkenwell green - i 'd been there this morning - and i 've seen absolutely no trouble at all , all day .
i think that people do focus - both the police and the media - want to focus on the violence because it makes exciting pictures but that 's not what 's exciting about a day like to day .
what 's exciting is the sheer number of people who come out in agreement .
manisha tank : there were incidences today of a little bit of a fracas , if you like , with the police and they did get out some of their riot gear when it came to piccadilly and the trocedero .
gemma , uk : if there is trouble , however minor , does n't this alienate people from your cause ?
with that we 'd like to know , does a police presence sometimes encourage some of the violence that we see ?
nick dearden : absolutely .
when we went into soho earlier on - i came here from old compton street where you saw the pictures from earlier on - and literally all of the back streets , which we did n't see on the footage , were lined with police vans with police sitting in them in riot gear .
this absolutely inflames people because people know that the reason they 're out on a day like this is a completely just one .
it 's for a better world , where people can have decent living standards , where people can have secure jobs , where people can have enough food to eat and enough clothes to wear .
so to see in a so-called democracy like ours , to see people ready , basically , for a fight just absolutely inflames people who are already pretty angry about the situation .
manisha tank : but sticking with this theme of the violence that sometimes occurs with these protests and the things that we were certainly worried about a year ago .
ben , in the uk asks : are n't you in a difficult situation ?
if the protests are peaceful no one notices , if there is violence you get the wrong sort of publicity and the issues are overlooked .
nick dearden : that 's definitely a point obviously .
what we try and do is make sure that every demonstration we have , however large it is , is to make sure we get word of it around .
there was an absolutely enormous demonstration on palestine a couple of weeks ago that did n't receive that much media attention , despite the fact it was the biggest demonstration ever on palestine in this country .
we use our networks to try to tell people and try and enthuse people but there 's all sorts of alternative media channels that are putting this sort of stuff out as well - but i agree , of course that is the problem .
manisha tank : jennifer ethington , usa : would you say that the protestors who advocate violence really believe they are achieving something worthwhile , or are they just yobs who have found an excuse to behave poorly ?
i am sure in your time you 've met people who 've perhaps gone to the other end of the spectrum and have n't been peaceful .
nick dearden : absolutely but i think the point of demonstrations like today 's is to say that we are absolutely condemning real violence in the world and real violence is keeping people away from their food .
real violence is keeping people who are suffering with hiv and aids in southern africa - the millions of people there who are suffering - keeping drugs from them that could help them live normal lives - basically to just enrich a few corporations and a few individuals - that 's real violence .
what we 're talking about is an absolutely tiny minority of people who basically smash a window or two - that 's vandalism and i would n't even call it violence .
in none of these protests has anybody ever been killed apart from of course in genoa when the police killed that young protester .
but i would say we 're absolutely opposing the violence of globalisation and also the violence of wars in afghanistan , iraq , palestine and it was the linking of those two things today that we saw - it 's a return to the anti-globalisation movement that so many people and so many politicians were crowing about six months ago .
manisha tank : let 's talk about your interests as a group .
let 's move onto the developing world .
oliver kamm , uk : a notable beneficiary of globalisation is the third world .
developing countries need foreign capital in order to fund the current account deficits that arise when a country 's investment opportunities exceed their domestic savings .
how do you feel about your role in campaigning to keep the third world poor ?
with that we 've had another email from hugh akston , uk : capitalism is simply a corollary of freedom - the freedom to engage with others in mutually advantageous trade agreements .
this is what has lifted the west out of the poverty in which the third world still languishes .
how do you expect citizens of third world countries to do the same if substantial barriers are erected to their freedom to trade with the world at large ?
nick dearden : well all of these economic theories are basically manmade constructs - we 've created the world to operate like this and it 's in the interest of a few people who 've created the world to operate like this that it continues to operate like this .
we 're part of a global movement , so today there were millions of people in africa , in asia , in latin america , also marching with us .
we quite often take our lead from those movements and those people are saying - we do n't want the freedom to be part of the world trade organisation , we do n't want the freedom to take world bank loans , we have enough food , we have enough basics in our country to feed and clothe everybody in our country .
it 's the economic system that the west has created that forcibly removes those resources from our country in order to make a few people in the west far richer than they actually need to be .
so i would completely dispute the fact that we 're taking money out of the third world .
what we are arguing for is a democratic third world , is a democratic globe where people can decide how the resources that they create are used and we want those resources to be used on making people 's lives decent rather than basically making a few corporations very wealthy .
manisha tank : that 's exactly the point and it 's not just the western world that has to play a role in doing that .
this is something that our next email point out .
rob coppinger , uk : why do you focus your protests against western governments and companies , when surely it 's the governments of the developing world who are responsible for not legislating against the child labour and poor pay that you 're fighting against ?
let 's face it , in some of the developing countries we 've issues with democracy too .
nick dearden : absolutely but who 's put those governments in the developing world in the first place - who supports those governments ?
if you look at where most of the united states open development aid goes - it goes to turkey , it goes to saudi arabia , it goes to colombia - really anti-democratic countries which use that american assistance , use american weapons - that they 're often just given at the expense of the american taxpayer - to suppress democracy in their own countries .
this is the sort of world that we 're living in - this is exactly what we 're fighting against .
these so-called corrupt regimes are almost all regimes that have been put there by the west at some time or another to serve their interests and basically stop the people in those countries enjoying the resources .
if you look at saddam hussein , who 's nowadays regarded as some new hitler - saddam hussein was basically supported and put in place by western governments the ability for him to create biological , chemical and nuclear weapons was given to him by the british government - was sold to him over many years at the british taxpayers ' expense .
this is the problem and that 's why we focus our protests at the western governments because we 're living in the west , because they call themselves democracies and because this is what we 're doing to the world .
manisha tank : what you 're obviously being able to do is give the information and see things from this different perspective which often does n't get onto the media and that 's is what may day is becoming .
so finally , to wrap it all up , we have a question from caz in the uk : it seems that providing people with lots of information that challenges their world view simply scares them off .
what advice do you have for anti-capitalist or corporatist individuals and groups who wish to educate the public and the police without becoming confrontational doing exactly what you 're doing ?
nick dearden : i think you 've got to say to people that they 're interest - ordinary people 's interest is not in the system that we 're living under at the moment .
although there may be people poorer than them in the world , the fact that we go out to work every day , that we 're scared about our jobs , that we get laid off and that we have to buy mortgages and that our pensions are invested in the stock market and we 're worried about our old age - this is n't in the interest of ordinary people , it 's just made to seem like it is .
i think that since september 11th , to be quite honest , the reason the anti-globalisation , anti-capitalist movement has grown so incredibly is that suddenly people 's certainties are shaken , suddenly people realise how the whole system works - that the system works by the west pulling resources out of the developing world and then going over and bombing people when they do n't do exactly what western governments want them to do .
i think that people have to be made to realise that their interests lie in the mass of people who are out there today .

manisha tank : what you 're obviously being able to do is give the information and see things from this different perspective which often does n't get onto the media and that 's is what may day is becoming .
so finally , to wrap it all up , we have a question from caz in the uk : it seems that providing people with lots of information that challenges their world view simply scares them off .
what advice do you have for anti-capitalist or corporatist individuals and groups who wish to educate the public and the police without becoming confrontational doing exactly what you 're doing ?
nick dearden : i think you 've got to say to people that they 're interest - ordinary people 's interest is not in the system that we 're living under at the moment .
although there may be people poorer than them in the world , the fact that we go out to work every day , that we 're scared about our jobs , that we get laid off and that we have to buy mortgages and that our pensions are invested in the stock market and we 're worried about our old age - this is n't in the interest of ordinary people , it 's just made to seem like it is .
i think that since september 11th , to be quite honest , the reason the anti-globalisation , anti-capitalist movement has grown so incredibly is that suddenly people 's certainties are shaken , suddenly people realise how the whole system works - that the system works by the west pulling resources out of the developing world and then going over and bombing people when they do n't do exactly what western governments want them to do .
i think that people have to be made to realise that their interests lie in the mass of people who are out there today .

over the last two years , the price of cars in britain has been the subject of inquiries by uk fair trade regulators and the european commission .
in a survey of 1,500 motorists , researchers found the proportion of those who felt they had been asked to over-pay was almost unchanged from two years ago .
at that time , 55 % of motorists felt " ripped off " but since then this has risen to 56 % .
lower or not ?
" although some car prices have fallen it seems that consumer perceptions are slow to change or they have n't changed enough , " said mintel consultant dominique allport .
but the consumer association maintained that prices are still too high .
" the government has laid down orders to reduce car prices by 10 % and manufacturers have refused to do this , " a spokeswoman for the association said .
in 2000 , the uk 's competition commission found motorists were paying between 10 % and 12 % more to buy a new car than drivers in the rest of europe - even though two-thirds of cars sold in britain were imported .
it proposed changes to the relationship between dealers and manufacturers .
in february , the european commission also announced a shake up of the car industry , designed to do away with big price differences between member countries .
it proposed to abolish the car industry 's exemption from european competition law - known as the block exemption - which has allowed a rigid network of national or regional dealers , selected by car manufacturers , to flourish .
