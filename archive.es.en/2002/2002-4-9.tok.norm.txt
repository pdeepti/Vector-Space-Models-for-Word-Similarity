all foreigners wishing to study in the us must obtain clearance before they can start a course , under a requirement that has been implemented with immediate effect .
officials also want to limit the time granted to business visitors and tourists to 30 days from as much as six months .
the tightening of rules comes after outrage that the immigration and naturalization service issued student visas to two of the 11 september hijackers - six months after the attacks took place .
under the changes which have already taken effect : all foreigners must obtain student visa before they begin studies foreigners may not enter the us on a business or visitor visa and then start studying while awaiting a student visa .
two of the men who hijacked planes and crashed them in new york and washington on 11 september came to the us on visitor visas and later applied for student visas .
approvals of the student permits for mohammed atta of egypt and marwan al-shehhi of united arab emirates were sent just last month to a flight school in florida where they are believed to have practised for the attacks .
bush ' stunned ' all 19 of the suspected hijackers entered the us legally , though three overstayed their visas .
at the time of the attacks , approximately 600,000 foreign students were enrolled in us colleges and universities and ins officials acknowledged they could not verify the whereabouts of many .
news of the visa approvals for atta and al-shehhi - believed to be the men who guided two passenger jets into the towers of the world trade center - sparked outrage from president george w bush and attorney general john ashcroft .
mr bush , who said he was " stunned " by the incident , fumed : " -lsb- the ins -rsb- needs to be modernised so we know who 's coming , and who 's going out and why they 're here . "
" these new rules strike the appropriate balance between ins ' mission to ensure that our nation 's immigration laws are followed and stop illegal immigration and our desire to welcome legitimate visitors " ins commissioner james ziglar the proposed overhaul of visitor visas would eliminate the six-month maximum admission period and visas would be granted for the amount of time needed for a trip .
in practice , that would average about 30 days , the ins said .
extensions would only be granted if a visitor could show an unexpected or compelling reason , such as the need for medical treatment or a delay in completing a business matter , one official said .
the changes would have a huge impact on people visiting relatives for more than one month and retirees and young people who want to spend many weeks sightseeing .
the ins said about 10 million people received tourist visas in 2000 , the latest year with available data , and 75 % of them stayed less than a month .
another 2.5 million travelled to america on business and stayed an average of 13 days .
ins commissioner james ziglar said : " these new rules strike the appropriate balance between ins ' mission to ensure that our nation 's immigration laws are followed and stop illegal immigration and our desire to welcome legitimate visitors to the united states . "

a shock profit warning from ibm was quickly followed by an upbeat statement from its competitor compaq .
the revised forecasts come just ahead of the reporting season when us companies tell investors how they fared during the january to march period .
analysts are especially concerned to assess when the ailing technology sector will recover .
this year - or next ?
corporate spending on technology has been dismal for the past year due to the economic downturn , hampering profits at most technology companies and denting computer sales .
many companies have been predicting a modest recovery in the second half of this year .
but industry research group gartner dataquest said two weeks ago that technology spending by large european companies would not really pick up before the second half of 2003 .
gartner predicted growth of about 4-5 % during 2002 , half of the ten-year average .
gloom but the news from ibm made it clear that companies have not yet started spending again , investors said .
" ibm 's news implies that the strength of the us recovery is weaker than the markets had thought , " said one paris-based trader .
it was the first time since june 1991 that the leading us computer maker had warned that its figures would disappoint .
" ibm is so involved in so many aspects of technology .
this is not good for the technology sector , " said okumus capital president ahmet okumus .
consolidation hopes compaq 's promise that it will meet or beat its profit and sales estimates during the first three months of the year follows a similar announcement from number one computer maker , dell .
compaq said it had retained its market share , despite claims from competitors that ongoing takeover negotiations with hewlett-packard had confused customers and encouraged defections to rival computer makers .
compaq 's us rival sun microsystems said last week that it , as well as peers dell and ibm , stand to benefit from the integration of compaq and hp .

the bbc 's correspondent in cairo says the announcement of the pull-out should help the atmosphere of mr powell 's meeting with president hosni mubarak , but the egyptians will still demand greater us pressure on israel .
mr mubarak has been a key us ally in the middle east but is now becoming frustrated by america 's reluctance to intervene .
withdrawal welcomed mr powell gave a cautious welcome to the withdrawal , though he repeated calls for the israelis to leave all the west bank towns it has occupied .
" let us hope that this is not a little bit of this and a little bit of that , but the beginning of a pullback , " mr powell said .
earlier he told morocco 's king mohammed that he wanted to co-ordinate a plan with arab and european allies before he arrived in israel on thursday .
he gave a similar message to saudi crown prince abdullah , asking for arab help to tell palestinians that " violence is not the way to achieve our mutually desired goal of a palestinian state " .

israel 's foreign minister shimon peres said mr powell would be allowed to enter the restricted area where mr arafat is besieged inside his west bank headquarters .

it warns that some sectarian attitudes may remain beneath the surface because the church has turned a blind eye in the past .
the kirk 's church and nation committee , which compiled the report , recommends that a working group be set up immediately to " tackle the demon in society " .
the report will be submitted to the church 's general assembly in may and stresses that " sectarianism is not someone else 's problem " .
our church 's record on this issue in times past is far from blameless .
church of scotland report the report 's authors said they recognised the part played by the church of scotland in promoting anti-catholic sentiments in the 1930s .
" our church 's record on this issue in times past is far from blameless , " they said , recalling how the committee campaigned against irish immigration to scotland during the depression .
while the present organisation may feel itself more enlightened , the report added : " we may also be judged in hindsight to have turned a blind eye to sectarian attitudes which will still remain on and under the surface of the church of scotland today . "
progress has been made on ecumenical relations with other churches , notably the catholic church in scotland .
racial equality but the report added that although the orange order " clearly see themselves as a law-abiding group which promotes civil and religious liberty in scotland " it is " widely perceived to be a sectarian organisation " .
sectarianism has plagued scotland for years the committee said " those within the church of scotland who associate themselves with the order should reflect upon this and take this to heart " .
the general assembly will be asked to consider the need to introduce an offence of " sectarian aggravation " similar to legislation relating to " religiously aggravated crime " in the wake of the 11 september terror attacks .
the committee has called on public authorities to promote racial equality and new standards of professionalism within institutions .
the report praised the work of initiatives such as bridging the gap in gorbals , glasgow , and the scottish centre for non-violence in dunblane .
it has called for a working group to be set up , if possible , in partnership with the roman catholic justice and peace commission .
