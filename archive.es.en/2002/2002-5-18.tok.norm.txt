more than 50 million of the world 's most beloved plastic bricks await visitors at lego 's new theme park in bavaria .
the company expects its two million annual visitors will jumpstart the local economy . it used to be that travelers wishing to visit the reichstag , the brandenburg gate , or the kaiser wilhelm memorial church had to go all the way to berlin .
but that all changed with the opening on friday in günzberg of danish toymaker lego 's latest theme park .
germany 's greatest attractions and countless others have been immortalized using 50 million brightly colored , interlocking plastic bricks and brought together in a disneyland-like park for daydreamers .
legoland ’ s 80 designers worked for two years to faithfully recreate just about every famous landmark in the country using scale models .
campaigning with legos at the park 's public opening on friday , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who is campaigning to become germany 's next chancellor , seemed impressed .
he leaned up against the scale model of the reichstag and offered : " i 'm always pleased to be in berlin . "
stoiber 's wife karin , who joined him at the ribbon-cutting event , said her husband loves playing with legos , especially with his grandson , johannes .
" at the moment , granddad is taking turns with me and -lrb- johannes ' -rrb- father building a garage , " she claimed .
25 soccer fields of fun the hordes of tourists will add a welcome economic push to the small town of 20,000 , and günzberg has been feverishly preparing for its new star attraction .
hotels have been revamped to accommodate families and children .
" obviously , our target group is families with small children , " says john jakobsen , legoland germany 's ceo .
" and there ’ s a limit as to how many people we want to have together in one place on one day .
our vision for this park is about two million visitors annually . "

the survey , conducted by icm for radio 4 's today programme , also found that eight out of ten people think the way political parties currently raise their finances makes people ' suspicious of politicians ' .
and it showed that seven out of ten people believe rich individuals and big businesses exert too much influence on party policy .
the results will make difficult reading for tony blair , who said earlier this week that he would like to put an end to fundraising , but conceded it was unlikely the public would agree to state funding .
frustration just one in four people surveyed said they supported the idea that taxpayers should cover the cost of having political parties .
and despite the opposition to donor influence six out of ten decided it is a price worth paying and the system should not change . "
you ca n't have a situation where we as a government use our majority to push it through " tony blair almost half said they did not approve of the way the parties collected money from business , the unions and the rich .
the findings come after the prime minister spoke on bbc 2 's newsnight programme of his frustration over complaints about the way the labour party has raised money from big business and trade unions .
he said : " if i could get shot of ever raising a single penny for the labour party ever again , would i not do it ?
absolutely , of course i would . "
but he said he would not condone the move unless there was a consensus amongst the political parties .
mr blair said : " you ca n't have a situation where we as a government use our majority to push it through .
" and i 'm not sure the public would accept it either . "

president george bush on friday made his first personal statement on the issue , saying he " would have done everything in his power to stop the attacks if he had known in advance " .
suicide bombers could crash-land an aircraft packed with high explosives into the pentagon , the headquarters of the cia or the white house september 1999 intelligence report but the senate majority leader , tom daschle , dismissed mr bush 's defence , accusing him of missing the point .
" i think the question is , why did n't he know ?
if the information was made available , why was he kept in the dark ? " the democrat politician said .
his comments came as it was revealed that two years before the 11 september attacks , an analysis prepared for us intelligence warned that osama bin laden 's terrorists could hijack an airliner and fly it into government buildings .
" suicide bomber -lrb- s -rrb- belonging to al-qaeda 's martyrdom battalion could crash-land an aircraft packed with high explosives -lrb- c-4 and semtex -rrb- into the pentagon , the headquarters of the central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- , or the white house , " the september 1999 report said .
no alarm the bush administration has asserted that no-one in government had envisioned a suicide hijacking before it happened .
white house press secretary ari fleischer said the administration was aware of the report , which was prepared by the library of congress for the national intelligence council , which advises the president and us intelligence on emerging threats .
our nation is not well served when the charge of partisan politics is levelled at those who simply seek information that the american people need and deserve to know democrat richard gephard he said the document did not contain direct intelligence pointing towards a specific plot but rather included assessments about how terrorists might strike .
" what it shows is that this information that was out there did not raise enough alarm with anybody , " mr fleischer said .
he indicated that he found the criticism of the president unacceptable .
" i think that any time anybody suggests or implies to the american people that this president had specific information that could have prevented the attacks on our country on 11 september , that crosses the lines , " he said .
but the democrat house minority leader , richard gephardt called for a congressional inquiry into the affair .

about 3,000 people died in the 11 september attacks the white house had earlier revealed that a presidential order to topple the al-qaeda network was prepared just before 11 september .
but the proposals had not reached mr bush at the time of the attacks .

the ships were sent to accompany indonesia 's president megawati sukarnoputri as she attends celebrations marking the territory 's independence . "
we are not angry , just puzzled with this ostentatious display of navy hardware " jose ramos-horta the east timorese foreign minister , jose ramos-horta , said indonesia was mounting an " ostentatious display of military hardware " .
east timor broke away from indonesia in 1999 after a referendum organised by the united nations which sparked a wave of violence by the indonesian military and pro-jakarta militias .
the territory has been administered by the un since then .
ahead of sunday 's celebrations , when the un flag will be lowered , president-elect xanana gusmao said the improvement of living standards - not revenge - should be the new country 's priority .
' public relations failure ' " there was no such thing as a security arrangement .
we did not agree for indonesia to bring in six warships or so , " said mr ramos-horta .
he said only one ship would be allowed to dock , and indonesian personnel would be allowed to remain on shore only if they were unarmed .
" we are not angry , just puzzled with this ostentatious display of navy hardware that obviously is not a good public relations exercise for indonesia in the eyes of the timorese and -lrb- of -rrb- major powers such as the us , " he said .
the indonesian ships have a large number of military personnel on board .
indonesian officials have apparently requested that more than 100 be allowed to protect the president during the independence celebrations on sunday night .
east timor key facts : population of 800,000 asia 's poorest country languages include tetum , portuguese and indonesian 90 % roman catholic see also : east timor in depth president megawati is due to fly into east timor for the ceremony at midnight -lrb- 1500 gmt -rrb- on sunday , when the un administration will formally hand over sovereignty to east timor 's new administration former us president bill clinton will also be arriving on sunday , as will the u n secretary general , kofi annan and australian prime minister john howard .
their security contingents will be far smaller than that requested by indonesia .
a bbc correspondent in the east timorese capital , dili , says that despite this diplomatic incident the east timorese government remains confident the indonesian president will attend the ceremony .
most of the navy ships have already moved away from the coast to international waters .
mr horta praised mrs megawati 's political courage in deciding to press ahead with the visit , despite protests from members of her own parliament .
it is highly likely , our correspondent says , that elements within the indonesian military are also opposed to her attendance and may be deliberately trying to spark an incident to force her to cancel .
call for reconciliation on friday , the un security council approved a new peacekeeping mission for east timor , consisting of 5,000 troops and 1,250 police officers .
mr gusmao told a news conference that those responsible for the atrocities surrounding east timor 's 1999 vote for independence should be punished , but feelings of hatred and revenge should be eradicated .
" we must do our best to eradicate old sentiments of hatred and revenge ... otherwise we are living with the ghosts of the past , " he said .
he suggested that those who took part in the violence should be tried and jailed .
but their sentences could be commuted for good behaviour , and offenders should be fully rehabilitated into the community , he said .
mr gusmao reiterated his desire to be a pumpkin farmer rather than president .
" but i promised i would go again and again to listen to them , to discuss their difficulties ... hoping that five years later i can serve -lrb- them -rrb- a big pumpkin " .
he said the people of east timor fought for independence " to see their daily lives improve " , adding that : " right from the beginning we have many problems .
we are the poorest country in asia . "

ahead of sunday 's celebrations , when the un flag will be lowered , president-elect xanana gusmao said the improvement of living standards - not revenge - should be the new country 's priority .
' public relations failure ' " there was no such thing as a security arrangement .
we did not agree for indonesia to bring in six warships or so , " said mr ramos-horta .
president megawati 's trip has been controversial he said only one ship would be allowed to dock , and indonesian personnel would be allowed to remain on shore only if they were unarmed .
" we are not angry , just puzzled with this ostentatious display of navy hardware that obviously is not a good public relations exercise for indonesia in the eyes of the timorese and -lrb- of -rrb- major powers such as the us , " he said .
the indonesian ships have a large number of military personnel on board .
indonesian officials have apparently requested that more than 100 be allowed to protect the president during the independence celebrations on sunday night .
east timor key facts : population of 800,000 asia 's poorest country languages include tetum , portuguese and indonesian 90 % roman catholic see also : east timor in depth president megawati is due to fly into east timor for the ceremony at midnight -lrb- 1500 gmt -rrb- on sunday , when the un administration will formally hand over sovereignty to east timor 's new administration former us president bill clinton will also be arriving on sunday , as will the u n secretary general , kofi annan and australian prime minister john howard .
their security contingents will be far smaller than that requested by indonesia .
a bbc correspondent in the east timorese capital , dili , says that despite this diplomatic incident the east timorese government remains confident the indonesian president will attend the ceremony .
most of the navy ships have already moved away from the coast to international waters .
mr horta praised mrs megawati 's political courage in deciding to press ahead with the visit , despite protests from members of her own parliament .
it is highly likely , our correspondent says , that elements within the indonesian military are also opposed to her attendance and may be deliberately trying to spark an incident to force her to cancel .
call for reconciliation on friday , the un security council approved a new peacekeeping mission for east timor , consisting of 5,000 troops and 1,250 police officers .
mr gusmao told a news conference that those responsible for the atrocities surrounding east timor 's 1999 vote for independence should be punished , but feelings of hatred and revenge should be eradicated .
" we must do our best to eradicate old sentiments of hatred and revenge ... otherwise we are living with the ghosts of the past , " he said .
he suggested that those who took part in the violence should be tried and jailed .
but their sentences could be commuted for good behaviour , and offenders should be fully rehabilitated into the community , he said .
mr gusmao reiterated his desire to be a pumpkin farmer rather than president .
" but i promised i would go again and again to listen to them , to discuss their difficulties ... hoping that five years later i can serve -lrb- them -rrb- a big pumpkin " .
he said the people of east timor fought for independence " to see their daily lives improve " , adding that : " right from the beginning we have many problems .
we are the poorest country in asia .

although the software problem was fixed on friday , airlines are struggling to clear the backlog of flights which built up .
british airways , which had to cancel 87 flights on friday , said it expected problems to continue into the weekend .
toby nicol , from budget airline easyjet , said it had been forced to refund passengers without any hope of receiving compensation itself .
he told bbc radio 5 live : " for those people going away on a friday or coming back into the country ... it 's just been a complete and utter mess . "
' significant disruption ' airports said they hoped to clear the backlog during saturday , but passengers were advised to call ahead as they could still be affected .
air traffic controllers at swanwick had to halve the number of aircraft normally in the skies because only half of the control positions were working at full capacity on friday morning .
services were further affected by an air traffic control problem in brussels , which has delayed the recovery of flights out of gatwick and heathrow in particular .
a spokeswoman for heathrow airport said it expects to continue to suffer " significant disruption into the weekend as a result of air traffic control problems " .
gatwick airport said 70 % of flights were affected at one point on friday .
stansted was also badly affected by the software glitch , while regional airports said they had started to clear the backlog during the afternoon on friday .
a spokesman for baa scottish airports said the problems had a knock-on effect north of the border .
' no safety issues ' nats said the problem began after a regular monthly computer upgrade at swanwick , which controls most of the airspace across england and wales .
nats chief executive richard everitt insisted safety had not been compromised .
he said : " there are no safety issues , i can assure you on that .
our systems are designed with safety right at the heart of them , including our fall-back position . "
it is the third time in two months flights have been delayed by air traffic control system problems .

on saturday an ex-labour defence minister became the latest person to claim the royal marines ' success had been exaggerated , and that little had been achieved . "
there certainly is a suspicion that . there is a need to hype up the success of the operation when probably not a lot has been achieved " doug henderson british and us forces were called to assist australian troops in south-eastern afghanistan after they came under attack from suspected taleban and al-qaeda fighters on thursday .
mr hoon insisted the operation had gone according to the plan outlined in the house of commons .
" i think it is very , very important to stress that this is not ... some sort of war by safari .
this is specifically a reaction to particular information , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" the australian forces knew they were engaging the enemy .
they were attacked by elements of al-qaeda and the taleban .
there was a prolonged fire-fight .
" i have very good reasons for knowing these forces were in that particular position for a number of days for that particular purpose .
" they were attacked .
they then called in support for coalition forces . "
casualty risk the defence secretary said he was " very proud " of the royal marines ' performance .
" certainly there has been combat and certainly our forces have been engaged in assisting other coalition forces in that effort , " he said .
mr hoon has come under fire for warning of possible casualties when he announced that the marines would be sent in to track down al-qaeda and taleban forces .
but the defence secretary insists he acted entirely properly - and that his warning remains in effect .
" when i warned the house of commons of the risk of casualties arising from combat i was warning the country quite properly of the need to recognise the real risk to our forces and that remains absolutely the case , " he said .
' task unclear ' ex-labour defence secretary doug henderson 's " hype " accusation came as the royal marines ' latest mission , alongside australian special forces , appeared to fall short of the major assault on al-qaeda described by commanders .
" there certainly is a suspicion that because the task is unclear , because perhaps the motivation may have been more political than military , there is a need to hype up the success of the operation when probably not a lot has been achieved , " he told today .
" if the purpose is to rid afghanistan of al-qaeda forces and forces sympathetic to al-qaeda they wo n't do that in three months .

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- israel 's modern immigrants categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : middle east front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 18 may , 2002 , 10:09 gmt 11:09 uk israel 's modern immigrants sharon wants most of the world 's jews in israel by 2020 by raffi berg bbc news online as the palestinian intifada -lrb- uprising -rrb- continues , israel is conducting a second , more global campaign - to attract foreign jewish settlement .
shortly after becoming prime minister in 2001 , ariel sharon set as his goal the task of attracting one million jews to israel in the next decade .
even when i was in south africa , i felt israel was always my home jacob chitiz it was an ambitious target , not least since the influx of foreign jews to israel dropped as the intifada gained pace .
whether the two events can be linked is debatable .
immigration from the former soviet union -lrb- fsu -rrb- , for example , declined as the economy stabilised - and for many jews who have made the move the eruption of violence was not a consideration .
" not for a second was the intifada an issue for me , " said 31-year-old jacob chitiz , who emigrated to israel from durban , south africa , in january , 2002 .
" i made a decision to move here regardless of the problems , " he said .
foreign jews make ' aliyah ' - literally , going up to israel - for a multitude of reasons , but one common thread among immigrants is a belief in israel as a jewish homeland .
" even when i was in south africa , i felt israel was always my home , " said jacob .
" i feel comfortable here .
i do n't have to worry about being jewish because everyone else is jewish here as well , " he said .
jews , in fact , comprise 81 % of israel 's population and , according to israel 's central bureau of statistics , one in every seven people now living in israel arrived within the last 10 years .
culture shock despite his enthusiasm , jacob concedes he does n't yet feel integrated into israeli society .
just because things are n't so good at the moment you ca n't just run away mel davidson " anyone who comes from a different culture and says they fit in is not telling the truth . "
it 's a view echoed by mel davidson from manchester , england , who emigrated in january 2001 .
" it 's very easy to move to this country and not be israeli , " she said .
mel said she moved to israel " to do something a bit different " .
" i was never zionist and did n't know anything about the country before i moved here , " she said .
mr sharon has championed jewish immigration " what i miss about britain is how easy it was to do things over there - the attitude and red tape here is terrible .
" what i like about israel , though , is that anything goes here - nobody judges you at all .
it does n't matter if you work in a restaurant or sweep the street , there 's not the same importance attached to status that there is in england . "
when mel moved to israel the intifada was four months old and the fighting has worsened considerably since .
the violence , she says , has made life hard , " but just because things are n't so good at the moment you ca n't just run away " .
soviet factor since israel was founded in 1948 , more than a third of all immigrants have come from the fsu - nearly one million since 1989 alone .
israel 's immigrants say anti-semitism in europe led to their decision there are 400,000 jews still in russia and although the exodus has slowed , the flow continues .
asia gelfand moved to israel from st petersburg 12 years ago during the height of the first intifada .
then 10 years old , she says her parents decided to emigrate because of rising anti-semitism .
now she says : " i feel israel is home but my parents would probably think twice before they answer this question .
" young russian immigrants are accepted here much better than our parents - we learn the language quicker and we adjusted to our new surroundings much easier , " she said .
political impact the huge influx of russian jews has had a significant impact on the shape of israeli politics , and , consequently , the peace process .
i see what 's going on in europe and i 'm not that optimistic that the holocaust ca n't happen again asia gelfand traditionally hawkish , voters from the former soviet republics - about 15 % of the israeli electorate - helped unseat former prime minister ehud barak in elections in 2001 , in favour of the right-wing sharon -lrb- himself the son of russian immigrants -rrb- .
" we do n't always approve of what the government 's doing but , as sharon said , this is the only place on earth where we can protect ourselves , " said asia .
" i see what 's going on in europe and i 'm not that optimistic that the holocaust ca n't happen again .
" a lot of people think like i do , " she said , " that israel is our homeland , our only homeland , and it must survive " .

dave mill became trapped on an ice floe after delays scuppered his attempt to become the first man to complete a solo and unaided walk from canada to the pole .
now he must travel 100km to reach ice which is solid enough to allow a rescue aircraft to land .
this is literally a life or death scenario team spokeswoman his crew said he was facing " certain death " if he did not make it within eight days .
the 34-year-old , from kenmore in perthshire , said : " the next eight days will be like walking into the jaws of a shark . "
mr mill set off from canada at the end of march in his third attempt to complete the journey .
last year he returned home after setting a new record for walking solo and unaided towards the north pole before melting ice forced him to abandon his attempt .
mr mill was also on the back-up expedition that followed sir ranulph fiennes in 2000 when the english explorer had to abort his attempt due to frostbite .
mr mill must travel 100km in eight days the scottish explorer fell behind schedule on his latest expedition after experiencing a number of problems , including a broken stove .
this meant that he found himself in an area which is more prone to ice break-up as the north pole approaches the longest day of the year .
he now needs to travel about 100km using a pulk , a sledge which can be used as a small boat to cross water , to find ice which is solid enough that an aircraft can land and rescue him .
a spokeswoman from his team said : " this is literally a life or death scenario .
" if the plane does n't reach him in the next eight days , the full moon 's gravitational pull will force the ice rubble into a mountain meaning certain death for him . "

but this year , the focus looks set to shift to the film industry .
the technology that enabled music tracks to be compressed to a size that could be sent over the internet is now being used to put whole movies on to the net .
one of the most common is called divx , a highly versatile video compression technology based on the mpeg-4 format .
however , it can also be used to turn a dvd film into a small enough file to fit on a blank cd .
sharing films downloading movies has been popular with americans wired up to broadband .
it has not quite reached the proportions of music file-sharing .
but there are enough movies being made available by hardcore enthusiasts that you are likely to find your favourite blockbuster available for download .
like copying a music album to mp3 , creating a compressed film is as simple as loading a dvd movie and running one of the many freely available software " rippers " .
for those living in countries outside the us where broadband is available , downloading a movie from the net is particularly enticing .
many of the newest films available have not yet received a worldwide release .
more often than not , this is because in the us , dvds are sold to the public shortly after the cinemas stop showing the film .
however , there are even cases where disgruntled film industry workers have managed to obtain a digitised version of a film and put it out on to the web before its release in the us .
pc screen technology has not only made sharing films much easier .
it has also opened up other means of watching movies on a computer .
vhs tapes : the way we were having successfully downloaded the movie to your computer , one is obviously left with the problem of storing and managing what is understandably a large file .
divx technology is able to compress a movie to such an extent that the film can fit on to a recordable cd , with little loss in quality .
the encoding software automatically selects the compression rate needed to create the 700 mb file that would fit on a cd .
the resulting file is about 15 % of the size of the original dvd .
this means you can burn the file straight on to a cheap , blank , recordable cd and watch the movie on any computer , even those that do not have a dvd drive .
this is achieved by using the large amount of processing power available on a computer to compress the data .
during playback an equally large amount of processing power is needed to convert the compressed film into something viewable .
dvds use a much smaller level of compression , which allows them to play in devices that do not have a massive amount of processing power such as a home dvd player .
stopping piracy independent filmmakers are already releasing their work in divx format .
like the record industry , work is under way to modify the technology to include a " secure wrapper " so that internet users can legally download hollywood movies after paying a subscription charge .
once downloaded , these modified movie files might only play for a time-limited period , just like renting a video .
at the moment , blocks put on dvds to stop them being copied are simply circumvented by most dvd ripping software .
it is inevitable that any further measures implemented by the industry will just be hacked and evaded .
the popularity of mp3s has hit the record industry hard and not just in terms of legal fees and sales it argues it has lost .
now it is the film industry 's turn and one can not help thinking that they are in for a rough ride .

money box has found that even those on a low income , who signed up to deals that they thought would protect them , are finding they are having to pay more .
saga energy , in conjunction with northern electric and gas , is among the suppliers that has increased prices on its special deal for the over fifties .
one moneybox listener has found that the 13 % rise in his bill has wiped out any savings he had hoped to make .
and saga is not alone in increasing its prices .
txu energy , whose stay warm deal promises to cut bills for thousands of pensioners , this week increased prices for some customers by as much as 14 % .
the consumer watchdog energywatch says this new completely free market means customers need to be increasingly vigilant about the deal they sign up to .
however ofgem estimates that you can save as much as £ 100 pounds a year by switching your energy supplier .
organisations like energywatch and uswitch can calculate for you which gas and electricity suppliers will offer the best price .
when you contact them you need to know the name of your current supplier , the size of your annual bill and how you want to pay .
once you have made the decision to move you must notify your existing supplier in writing giving 28 days notice , and do not forget to read the meter the day you change over .
if you want to cut your fuel bill firstly look at your method of payment .
direct debit is by far the cheapest - many suppliers will give a small discount because they know they will get regular payments .
whereas if you are on a pre-payment meter energywatch has estimated that you can expect to pay as much as 15 % more .
secondly , take advice on how to make your home more energy efficient .
local councils around the country are trying to cut energy consumption and many have grants and loans available to help pay for loft insulation and the like .

when it finally arrived , it allowed me and a cameraman four days in pyongyang , the capital of north korea .
the schedule was prearranged and a pair of cheerful , ruthlessly efficient minders met us at the airport and never let us out of their sight .
pyongyang has an unnerving stillness to it .
the traffic , even at rush hour , is little more than a trickle .
public transport is scarce .
everybody walks , often alone and silent , down green boulevards , past huge white apartment blocks .
north korea has been in crisis for a decade now .
when the soviet union collapsed , soviet aid dried up .
no more subsidised oil and food .
north korea had to fend for itself .
by the mid-1990s the famine was so severe that more than a million people are thought to have died from malnutrition and related illness .
international food aid saved north korea .
but only in part .
the country owes its continued cohesion to its politics .
life in north korea is utterly dominated by the cult of personality surrounding its late president kim il-sung , known as the great leader , and his son , kim jong-il , the dear leader .
kim jong-il is now in charge .
he smiles from billboards , and from the lapel pins that every north korean wears .
he drops into factories , farms and offices to give what is called on the spot guidance .
his subjects burst into applause and grateful tears .
no-one has ever interviewed kim jong-il .
the bbc was n't about to be the first to do so .
sightseeing in fact , our schedule turned out to be a mixture of those things reporters dread most - monuments , exhibitions , and performances .
we saw kim il-sung 's birthplace .
we wandered through an exhibition of north korean achievements in heavy industry .
and we were taken to the children 's palace for a cultural performance .
the lobby of the children 's palace is a monstrosity in marble and chandeliers .
in it stands a model - some 20 foot high - of the space shuttle on its launch pad .
in a strange fantasy of technology and power , the space shuttle has become north korean .
it has north korean insignia on it and north korean slogans .
there is no reference to its true origins at all .
every day 5,000 children come to the palace after school for lessons in music , dance and martial arts .
it is a hothouse .
children who show talent are taken into special classes in the accordion or dancing with hoops .
in the martial arts hall , as the afternoon light streamed in , we watched 14-year old girls practising tae kwon do .
they were focused and concentrated unlike any children i have ever seen .
one girl , a brown belt , caught my eye amid a flurry of punches .
short haired , arms like steel cable , she looked as if she was about to tear my kidneys out .
' a cultural performance ' the children take their inspiration from the revolutionary exploits of the great leader kim il-sung , said our children 's palace guide , and ushered us on .
the " cultural performance " was a waking nightmare .
tiny girls in thick makeup and skimpy costumes did coy little dances .
talented boys in sequins thrashed away on xylophones .
and a choir turned in teary salute to a portrait of kim jong-il surrounded by white doves .
it was all technically brilliant , and void of any meaning or artistic merit , a tribute to despotism by exploited , overwrought kids . "
the kim cult has imposed more than ideology ; it has imposed a whole climate of thought and behaviour " the children 's successes , said our stony faced guide , were thanks to the wise leadership of the dear leader and supreme commander , comrade kim jong-il .
i have reported from other cities that labour beneath repressive regimes .
it is often surprisingly easy to spot the small , spirited acts of dissent - a scrap of graffiti , a taxi driver 's joke , an article of clothing worn askew .
the kim cult but in pyongyang , nothing .
the kim cult has imposed more than ideology ; it has imposed a whole climate of thought and behaviour .
north korea can not go on forever as it is .
the country ca n't feed itself .
its industry has collapsed .

when it finally arrived , it allowed me and a cameraman four days in pyongyang , the capital of north korea .
the schedule was prearranged and a pair of cheerful , ruthlessly efficient minders met us at the airport and never let us out of their sight .
life in north korea is dominated by kim jong-il and his late father , kim il-sung pyongyang has an unnerving stillness to it .
the traffic , even at rush hour , is little more than a trickle .
public transport is scarce .
everybody walks , often alone and silent , down green boulevards , past huge white apartment blocks .
north korea has been in crisis for a decade now .
when the soviet union collapsed , soviet aid dried up .
no more subsidised oil and food .
north korea had to fend for itself .
by the mid-1990s the famine was so severe that more than a million people are thought to have died from malnutrition and related illness .
international food aid saved north korea .
but only in part .
the country owes its continued cohesion to its politics .
life in north korea is utterly dominated by the cult of personality surrounding its late president kim il-sung , known as the great leader , and his son , kim jong-il , the dear leader .
kim jong-il is now in charge .
he smiles from billboards , and from the lapel pins that every north korean wears .
he drops into factories , farms and offices to give what is called on the spot guidance .
his subjects burst into applause and grateful tears .
no-one has ever interviewed kim jong-il .
the bbc was n't about to be the first to do so .
sightseeing in fact , our schedule turned out to be a mixture of those things reporters dread most - monuments , exhibitions , and performances .
we saw kim il-sung 's birthplace .
we wandered through an exhibition of north korean achievements in heavy industry .
and we were taken to the children 's palace for a cultural performance .
the lobby of the children 's palace is a monstrosity in marble and chandeliers .
in it stands a model - some 20 foot high - of the space shuttle on its launch pad .
in a strange fantasy of technology and power , the space shuttle has become north korean .
it has north korean insignia on it and north korean slogans .
there is no reference to its true origins at all .
north koreans are forbidden to speak to visitors every day 5,000 children come to the palace after school for lessons in music , dance and martial arts .
it is a hothouse .
children who show talent are taken into special classes in the accordion or dancing with hoops .
in the martial arts hall , as the afternoon light streamed in , we watched 14-year old girls practising tae kwon do .
they were focused and concentrated unlike any children i have ever seen .
one girl , a brown belt , caught my eye amid a flurry of punches .
short haired , arms like steel cable , she looked as if she was about to tear my kidneys out .
' a cultural performance ' the children take their inspiration from the revolutionary exploits of the great leader kim il-sung , said our children 's palace guide , and ushered us on .
the " cultural performance " was a waking nightmare .
tiny girls in thick makeup and skimpy costumes did coy little dances .
talented boys in sequins thrashed away on xylophones .
and a choir turned in teary salute to a portrait of kim jong-il surrounded by white doves .
it was all technically brilliant , and void of any meaning or artistic merit , a tribute to despotism by exploited , overwrought kids .
the kim cult has imposed more than ideology ; it has imposed a whole climate of thought and behaviour the children 's successes , said our stony faced guide , were thanks to the wise leadership of the dear leader and supreme commander , comrade kim jong-il .
i have reported from other cities that labour beneath repressive regimes .
it is often surprisingly easy to spot the small , spirited acts of dissent - a scrap of graffiti , a taxi driver 's joke , an article of clothing worn askew .
the kim cult but in pyongyang , nothing .
the kim cult has imposed more than ideology ; it has imposed a whole climate of thought and behaviour .
north korea can not go on forever as it is .
the country ca n't feed itself .
its industry has collapsed .
but there is no sign of how , or when , it might begin to change .
optimists say that the dear leader kim jong-il does want to introduce reform , but does n't know how to go about it .
pessimists say north korea is trapped in an orwellian hell of its own making .
and nothing short of disintegration will bring change .
what do ordinary koreans make of their predicament ?
i have no idea .
i was n't allowed to speak to any .
i wish i could say that they are just waiting for their moment ; that the students are strumming guitars and reading forbidden books ; or that gravel voiced dissidents are holding forth in smoky backrooms .
but i do n't know .
and if they are , i do n't fancy their chances .

but now they 've come together for the first time to pledge co-operation in helping afghanistan get back on its feet .
this is an important start on a bigger , longer foreign investment trail undp chief mark malloch brown with that goal in mind , finance ministers from all three countries are holding a two-day conference in the iranian capital , tehran , chaired by the un development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- .
the idea of iran and pakistan working together to help afghanistan towards stability first arose during a visit by the iranian foreign minister to islamabad before the emergence of the interim administration in kabul .
now it is starting to come to fruition .
wading in the conference in tehran brings together the finance and economy ministers as well as business leaders of all three countries .
foreigners are eying afghan markets their aim is to set up a joint commission , composed of both public and private sector economic leaders .
the commission is to clear the way for much greater trade and economic co-operation between the three and stimulate development in afghanistan .
" there 's a lot of big talk from the major global economic powers but it 's the neighbours who are the first to put their feet in the water , " says undp administrator mark malloch brown .
" this is an important start on a bigger , longer foreign investment trail that we want to take afghanistan down , " he added .
ambitious plans afghanistan is , of course , a land-locked country which has historically straddled major trade routes , both between east and west , and between north and south .
afghanistan is heavily dependent on food aid afghan minister hedayat amin-arsala said kabul was determined to regain that vital role as a bridge , with the private sector being designated as the main engine of development and growth .
legal frameworks were already being finalised , he said , to provide incentives and security for potential investors .
one of the top priorities of the joint commission will be to look at the high tariff barriers erected by both pakistan and iran , which have led to a huge volume of smuggling in the region .
the ministers from both iran and pakistan expressed the hope that enhanced trade between all three countries could not only stabilise afghanistan but also give a boost to wider economic co-operation in the region .
the undp chief even saw the move as the potential nucleus of a new central asian market .
so , lots of ambitious talk and good intentions , but as always the proof will depend on concrete steps being taken to translate them into reality .

this is an important start on a bigger , longer foreign investment trail " undp chief mark malloch brown with that goal in mind , finance ministers from all three countries are holding a two-day conference in the iranian capital , tehran , chaired by the un development programme -lrb- undp -rrb- .
the idea of iran and pakistan working together to help afghanistan towards stability first arose during a visit by the iranian foreign minister to islamabad before the emergence of the interim administration in kabul .
now it is starting to come to fruition .
wading in the conference in tehran brings together the finance and economy ministers as well as business leaders of all three countries .
their aim is to set up a joint commission , composed of both public and private sector economic leaders .
the commission is to clear the way for much greater trade and economic co-operation between the three and stimulate development in afghanistan .
" there 's a lot of big talk from the major global economic powers but it 's the neighbours who are the first to put their feet in the water , " says undp administrator mark malloch brown .
" this is an important start on a bigger , longer foreign investment trail that we want to take afghanistan down , " he added .
ambitious plans afghanistan is , of course , a land-locked country which has historically straddled major trade routes , both between east and west , and between north and south .
afghan minister hedayat amin-arsala said kabul was determined to regain that vital role as a bridge , with the private sector being designated as the main engine of development and growth .
legal frameworks were already being finalised , he said , to provide incentives and security for potential investors .
one of the top priorities of the joint commission will be to look at the high tariff barriers erected by both pakistan and iran , which have led to a huge volume of smuggling in the region .
the ministers from both iran and pakistan expressed the hope that enhanced trade between all three countries could not only stabilise afghanistan but also give a boost to wider economic co-operation in the region .
the undp chief even saw the move as the potential nucleus of a new central asian market .
so , lots of ambitious talk and good intentions , but as always the proof will depend on concrete steps being taken to translate them into reality .

" the body was found in a room which resembles closely what was shown on the pictures sent by e-mails showing pearl in captivity " pakistani police official cnn cited us state department sources as saying that initial forensic tests had confirmed that the remains were those of the late wall street journal reporter .
the network reported that one final genetic test would be conducted to confirm the results .
pakistani police , who dug up the remains from an isolated shed outside the city of karachi , have so far declined to give any firm confirmation .
the dismembered and decomposed body was recovered from a shallow grave after three men recently detained by pakistani security forces tipped off the police .
four other men , including the british-born militant omar sheikh , are being tried by a special court at hyderabad on charges of abducting and murdering mr pearl .
they have pleaded not guilty .
on friday , pakistani officials stressed that detailed forensic examinations , including dna testing , would be needed to identify the body and that this could take a number of days .
fbi help however , pakistani sources have indicated that circumstantial evidence suggests the remains are indeed those of mr pearl .
police told the afp news agency the body had been found in a room which " resembles closely what was shown on the pictures sent by e-mails showing pearl in captivity . "
police also found a chair that resembles the one in photographs sent to news agencies by pearl 's kidnappers , chief investigator mansour mughal told the associated press .
mr mughal said buttons from the shirt pearl was wearing in the photographs were also found .
the remains and the site where they were found were inspected by fbi agents , who are helping pakistani policemen with their investigation .
dire warning on saturday , the police in karachi were reluctant to comment on the reports from washington .
sources told the bbc they were anxious to present " irrefutable evidence " to the special court in hyderabad and would not make any public comment before then .
meanwhile , prime suspect omar sheikh was quoted by the local press as having warned that if pakistan wanted peace , it should end its friendship with the united states .
omar sheikh 's lawyer rai bashir is reported to have passed on his comment that the us role in saudi arabia , palestine and afghanistan demanded a change in pakistani policy .
he is said to have added that , unless pakistan " honoured the blood of martyrs " , it could face the wrath of god in the form of natural calamities .

as the pope celebrates his eighty-second birthday , there have been renewed concerns about his health and speculation that he might retire .
his official spokesman insists that he will soldier on .
but the decision to have the pope only read the beginning and the end of a speech before an audience of thousands of children in rome will no doubt fuel more speculation .
occasionally , assistants do read the pope 's speeches , especially if they are in languages he finds difficult .
but the pope normally reads remarks in italian , such as saturday 's speech , himself .
reuters news agency reported that the arrangement appeared to have been agreed upon in advance , and was not caused by any new worsening in the pope 's health .
" thank you very much for your greetings , " the pope told the crowds of children , who sang happy birthday to him .
polish pilgrims the pope also received birthday greetings at a special vatican audience with 7,000 pilgrims , many of them from his birthplace , poland .
in recent months , john paul - one of the longest-serving popes in history - has become increasingly immobile .
his speech is often slurred , and his face mask-like , the result of parkinson 's disease .
he is in almost constant pain when he walks and may have to take to a wheelchair .
yet he continues to receive bishops and visiting dignitaries most days at the vatican .
foreign travel next week , he is due to resume his foreign travels after a gap of eight months .
on wednesday , he will travel to the former soviet republic of azerbaijan and to bulgaria .
later in the year , he is planning to visit canada , mexico and guatemala , and also his native poland in august .
two senior cardinals have hinted this week that the pope might consider stepping down if his health declines to the point that he becomes incapacitated .
traditionally , once elected , a pope serves for life .
no pope has resigned in modern times , although there is now a provision in canon law - the law of the roman catholic church - which states that he can resign if he wishes .
in this case , a conclave would be held and a successor elected by the college of cardinals , all of whom now have to be under 80 years old to vote - two years younger than the pope .

i think that it would be a great pity if people allowed their views of wales to be judged by this " welsh sports minister jenny randerson cardiff 's ninian park has been the scene of a series of violent incidents this season .
most notorious were matches against stoke city and leeds united , whose fans are second and third on the list of those banned .
unfairly branded but followers of the second division club insist that it is tackling the problem caused by a small minority of thugs .
clive francis , chairman of the cardiff city supporters club , said hooligans should not be described as fans .
" they do n't bring any credit to cardiff city football club or the city of cardiff , " he said .

" i think that it would be a great pity if people allowed their views of wales to be judged by this . "
john williams , director of the sir norman chester centre for football research at leicester university , said the prominence of cardiff in the list reflected a blanket approach by police .
he said the law allowed them to act against potential as well as convicted troublemakers if they had " reasonable grounds " to suspect they might misbehave .
" any club whose fans have been involved in large scale incidents will appear strongly on this list , " he said .
preventative measures bryan drew , head of the specialist intelligence branch of the national criminal intelligence service -lrb- ncis -rrb- said they had worked on getting the bans for the past two years with japanese colleagues .
" we have the power to prevent them leaving the country , " he said .
the next target would be " risk supporters " , he added .
" these are people not currently the subject of a football banning order but who may have a history or criminal record in this country , " he said .
these factors may still allow the japanese authorities to refuse them entry .
england fans heading for the world cup in japan have been warned about their behaviour .
the foreign and commonwealth office -lrb- fco -rrb- says those who break the law may be arrested and detained for up to 27 days while the police investigate the case .
