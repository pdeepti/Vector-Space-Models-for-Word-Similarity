mother and baby magazine said it found that 24 % of surveyed parents in scotland said they had attended a course on emergency treatment compared to 34 % in the rest of the uk .
and less than a third of those who had attended first aid classes said they could remember what had been taught .
the survey also found that parents north of the border were more likely to face the longest journeys for accident and emergency treatment in the uk .
the average was eight miles compared to six miles in the rest of the uk .
the average time for scottish parents undertaking this journey was recorded as 18 minutes or 31 minutes during rush-hour , compared to a 15-minute journey time for the rest of the uk .
the survey results also suggested a shortfall in basic home safety knowledge among scots parents .

readers ' responses just under one quarter , or 24 % , of parents north of the border believed children would obey warnings to stay away from lakes or ponds , compared to the uk average of 14 % .
the results of the survey were compiled from responses submitted by readers who had children aged under five .
the magazine said a sample of 2,000 responses , including about 160 scottish replies , were independently analysed by a research company to account for demographic spread .
the magazine said it plans to launch a series of life-saving courses run by st john ambulance at tesco stores for treating babies and young children .

over 4,000 women in the uk die from ovarian cancer each year and the latest initiative by the university of wales college of medicine will seek to offer vital new information .
lazar amso : an estimated 16,000 women aged from 50-75 will be randomly selected for the £ 650,000 three-year programme , which will be headed by consultant gynaecologist lazar amso .
mr amso said the project would help decide whether a national routine screening programme was required in the uk .
he added that it would also help contribute to the medical profession 's understanding of the disease .
" this study will alert us to any women currently suffering in the early stages of the disease that we otherwise might not know about , " said mr amso .
blood tests " the campaign is seeking to recruit up to 200,000 women from across the uk . "
similar existing screening programmes are undertaken for cervical and breast cancer .
half of those involved undergo blood tests and the other half will be given ultrasound scans .
women with a family history of ovarian cancer - or who have undergone treatment for cancer - will not be eligible to take part in the project .
intensive treatment funding for the uwcm programme has come from the medical research council , nhs research and development and leading cancer charities .
mr amso 's research will be studied by the london school of medicine .
in january , it was announced a new , intensive form of chemotherapy was being trialled to help treat women with ovarian cancer .
almost 80 % of those taking part in the trials - involving the drug cisplatin - saw their tumours shrink and 43 % saw the cancer disappear .
sir paul nurse , director general of the imperial cancer research fund , said the results of the study were very encouraging .
