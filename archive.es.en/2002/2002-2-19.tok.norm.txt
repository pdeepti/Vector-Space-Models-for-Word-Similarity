mrs yates , a 37-year-old former nurse , who has pleaded not guilty because of insanity , faces the death penalty if convicted .
her eyes were wider than what i 'd consider normal david knapp , first police officer on scene as her trial got underway in houston , defence lawyer george parnham said his client suffered from post natal depression with psychotic features , which he described as " the cruellest and most severe of mental illnesses " .
prosecutors agreed that she suffered from a mental illness but said that mrs yates was well aware of her actions when the children were killed last june .
" she knew this was an illegal thing .
it was a sin .
she knew it was wrong , " harris county assistant district attorney joe owmby said .
support from husband her husband , russell yates , has said he stands by his wife , saying she had twice attempted suicide and had been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for treatment .
yates ' children had been drowned in a bathtub in the family 's home the children , aged between six months and seven years old , were found dead in the family home in june last year after mrs yates called the police .
four of the children were discovered under sheets on a bed while a fifth was found in a bathtub .
all had been drowned .
mrs yates fidgeted and pulled at her fingers as she sat through the testimony of the first witness , police officer david knapp , who was the first to arrive at the yates ' home after the killings .
no emotion mr knapp said that when mrs yates opened the door to her house her hair and her clothes were wet .
she told him that she had called the police because she had killed her children .
he said that she led him to the master bedroom where four of the children lay .
if she -lsb- had -rsb- received the medical treatment that she deserved , then the kids would be alive and well husband russell yates according to mr knapp , " her eyes were wider than what i 'd consider normal " , but other than that , he said , mrs yates had displayed no emotion .
jurors heard mrs yates ' emergency call in which she requested police and an ambulance and told the switchboard operator she was " ill " .
history of depression mrs yates ' medical records reportedly give full details of her frequent bouts of depression and suicidal behaviour .
and a doctor also reportedly cautioned mrs yates and her husband not to have further children following the birth of their fourth child .
yates ' husband says he is standing by his wife she may face the death penalty under texas law , which states that the murder of a child under six or the killing of two people at the same time warrants capital punishment .
the case has strongly divided american opinion , with many unnerved by the prospect of sending a woman to the execution chamber but outraged by the horrific nature of the crime .
denied treatment others , particularly women 's rights groups , have argued that mrs yates had been denied treatment she desperately needed and should now be helped , not punished .
mrs yates ' husband echoed this sentiment when in a january interview with american television station cbs he said the blame for his children 's death lay with the doctors who he claimed failed to treat her successfully .
" i do n't blame her a bit , " he said on the station 's 60 minutes programme .
" if she -lsb- had -rsb- received the medical treatment that she deserved , then the kids would be alive and well .
and andrea would be well on her way to recovery . "

at the end of the two and a half days he was generously given by judge richard may to outline his case , he waved a video cassette which he had not had time to play , with the air of a man who had been asked to sum up his entire life in 30 seconds .
but what use did he make of the time he was allotted ?
in truth , there was only one theme - that the real authors of yugoslavia 's misfortunes and the war crimes which took place were nato and the western powers .
in his words , they had fanned the flames of ethnic hatred by their policies - for example , germany 's decision to recognise croatia as an independent state - and the serbs had reacted to events rather than instigated them .
serb support for mr milosevic , this line has two virtues .
it clearly appeals to serbs and serb supporters who feel aggrieved that they have been asked to bear the brunt of a collective failure to prevent the balkan tragedy .
it also reinforces his argument that the court needs to hear from key western politicians - bill clinton , madeleine albright et al - so that it can understand the context in which the events unfolded .
did he land any effective blows during his marathon opening ?
politically , he undoubtedly did .
there are questions about the attitude of western governments to milosevic , up to and including the dayton peace accords of 1995 .
but this is a matter for historians to adjudicate on .
in a court of law , it is the evidence which counts and what mr milosevic conspicuously did not do was to try to rebut the charges against him .
first witness after he sat down , the court was swiftly reminded of those charges when the first prosecution witness gave his testimony .
mahmut bakalli was not an insider witness from the milosevic inner circle , whom the prosecution has been assiduously courting .
but the veteran albanian communist gave a strong flavour of the persecution of ethnic albanians in kosovo which followed the first flexing of mr milosevic 's nationalist muscles at the end of the 1980s .
he also provided the trial with another memorable quote .
complaining to mr milosevic of the murder of an entire family , women and children included , by serb police , he told the court the reply from the serb leader was : " do n't get carried away .
we gave them two hours to get out of the building . "
it is a phrase which may come back to haunt the defendant .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- more women die after heart surgery categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 19 february , 2002 , 06:32 gmt more women die after heart surgery survival rates for men and women are equal in the uk women are up to three times more likely to die during or shortly after heart bypass surgery than men , a study reveals .
the younger the patients , the greater the mortality difference between the sexes , scientists suggest in the journal of the american heart association .
the findings follow studies which show women who have heart attacks have a higher in-hospital death rate than men , especially among those under the age of 60 .
other studies suggest women undergoing heart surgery have a higher risk than men of suffering a stroke shortly after the operation .
in the uk there is very little difference in death rates between genders sir charles george , british heart foundation coronary artery bypass surgery uses blood vessels to re-route blood flow around arterial blockages to improve the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart .
heart surgeons perform about 571,000 bypass operations every year in the usa , including about 182,000 in women .
the team at emory university of atlanta , which carried out the research , were unable to determine why death rates were different between the sexes .
dr viola vaccarino , who led the team , said the explanation might be some unknown factor that increases the risk for women who have bypass surgery , or something in the surgical procedure itself that might be subject to change .
the researchers reviewed records of 51,187 patients who received bypass surgery between october 1993 and december 1999 .
of these patients , 15,178 were women .
overall , 5.3 % of the women died in the hospital , compared with 2.9 % of the men .
when broken down , statistics showed 3.4 % of women younger than 50 died , compared with 1.1 % of men .
in the 50-59 age group , women had an 86 % higher risk of in-hospital death than men .
further investigation dr vaccarino said : " women tended to have more pre-existing illnesses and risk factors in their medical history , but they had less extensive coronary atherosclerosis -lrb- progressive narrowing and hardening of the arteries -rrb- and their hearts had better pump function . "
scientists thought diabetes may be to blame for the higher death rates among women - diabetes was twice as common in women among patients younger than 50 .
however additional ailments and heart disease risk factors accounted for less than 30 % of the mortality differences between young men and women .
the british heart foundation says britain does not replicate the findings of the us survey .
medical director at the british heart foundation professor sir charles george said : " this american study raises concerns , however uk statistics do n't show the same results .
" in the uk there is very little difference in death rates between genders .
" for both men and women , coronary artery bypass graft -lrb- cabg -rrb- surgery remains a relatively low-risk operation with high survival rates , in fact for men and women under 60 the survival rate is 97-98 % .
" the us figures show that three times as many men having cabg operations as women .
" the women who have a cabg are also more likely to have other illnesses such as diabetes and kidney failure , which may complicate the procedure and increase the risks . "
the us team says further investigation is necessary to determine the causes of the mortality differences .

a prototype lightweight roof system , which can also be used for athletic fields , has been produced by dundee university 's architecture school .
the experimental design is the result of three years of collaborative research with the university of munich .
the design could be employed at numerous events now academics from dundee hope to make the design commercially viable and end the misery suffered by sporting spectators around the world .
in february 2000 students at dundee 's lightweight structures unit -lrb- lsu -rrb- began investigating the weight-bearing properties of the canopy structures .
they compared their practical results with computer models developed in munich before progressing to full-scale working models of the canopy .
their work will be put to the test on tuesday when their canopy will be demonstrated at the university 's tennis courts at belmont hall .
during the design stage both teams worked within the requirements of the lawn tennis association and uk athletics .
safer structure studies of existing canopies found that they could only be deployed from the ground using heavy lifting equipment .
the students attempted to design a lighter , safer structure , which also has the benefit of taking up less space court or track-side when not in use .
they are now confident that they have come up with a deployable roof system which will protect sports people on tennis courts and athletic fields .
neil burford , co-founder of dundee 's lsu , said : " the workshop has been a great success and we 're now working to make the canopy commercially viable . "

last june , saudi arabia signed a series of interlinked contracts worth about $ 25bn with eight major foreign firms to develop gas fields the size of sweden over a 30-year period .
exxonmobil was chosen to lead the biggest project , know as south ghawar , or core venture 1 .
an exxon spokeswoman confirmed that chief executive lee raymond had held talks with saudi officials , but declined to give any details .
" all i can say is that it 's part of our ongoing negotiations regarding the core ventures , " said cynthia langlands of exxon .
profits worries ?
the deal , the first major foreign investment in the saudi energy sector since it was nationalized in 1975 , has reportedly run in difficulties .
analysts say oil firms have become unhappy about high taxes and are disappointed at the size of the reserves available .
shell , bp and the us company phillips are also involved in the core venture 1 project .
exxon is also the lead firm in core venture 2 , a project on the red sea coast , where its consortium partners are occidental and marathon .
the shaybah development , or core venture 3 , is based in saudi arabia 's south-eastern empty quarter desert .
it is to be led by shell taking a 40 % stake , with france 's totalfinaelf and conoco of the us , each expecting a 30 % share .
export boost ?
the projects - to be carried out in co-operation with state-run saudi aramco for up to 30 years - are expected to involve the development of natural gas fields , along with power plants , pipelines and water desalination projects .
saudi arabia hopes the projects will help convert the country 's domestic utilities from oil to gas dependency , freeing up more of the country 's crude oil output for export .
prince saud , seen as a moderniser , was one of the driving forces behind the initiative and successfully faced down the reluctance of national energy company saudi aramco to allow foreign investment in gas exploration and production .
in addition to the largest oil reserves in the world , saudi arabia has proven natural gas reserves of 6,600bn cubic metres .

the move was described as " entirely normal " by a british military spokesman in kabul , although he would not say whether it was for the soldiers ' own protection . "
they made no inquiries before they started shooting " reported conclusion of local investigator colonel zemary fazil four other paras remain in afghanistan but have been removed from the " theatre of operation " , which the ministry of defence says is standard practice during an investigation .
the six soldiers have said they returned fire from a kabul observation post after they were shot at in the early hours of saturday morning .
but the family that came under fire say they were unarmed and were victims of an unprovoked attack , which killed one and injured four .
the british military and afghan police both launched investigations .
hamid intervention according to the times newspaper , a local police report contradicts the british soldiers ' version of events .
with the incident threatening otherwise good relations between locals and the british-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , interim afghan leader hamid karzai has intervened .
he said although events were unclear there was " some sort of incident of firing " in which one or two shots were fired at the peacekeepers ' post .
but it is claimed that police investigator colonel zemary fazil believes the british troops opened fire after spotting the car 's lights during kabul 's night-time curfew .
before the paras ' firing nothing was heard by some of his own men stationed at the same building nor as he patrolled in the same area .
" i am absolutely certain that the only shooting had been from the isaf position , " the times quoted him as saying .
" they made no attempt to find out what was going on .
they made no inquiries before they started shooting . "
curfew defied the british-led peacekeepers have so far been warmly welcomed in the afghan capital but the " unfortunate " incident had undermined afghans ' faith in isaf , the colonel added .
a british military spokesman in kabul said he was aware of the reported police findings but could not comment further as the military investigation was still underway .
the family said they had defied the strict night time curfew -lrb- from 2130 local time -rrb- to take 21-year-old faria ishaq to hospital to give birth when they came under fire at about 0120 local time .
they say her brother in-law amaun , 20 , was killed outright .
her husband , mohammed ishaq , 25 , her mother-in-law and a neighbour , who was driving , were all injured .
mr ishaq said the family fled home where his wife gave birth before a joint patrol of peacekeepers and afghan police arrived at first light .
the baby boy appeared to be healthy , he said .
" we did not have any weapons of any kind , " he said , adding : " we did not hear any gunfire until we ourselves were shot . "
the patrol found a car riddled with gunshots near the family 's house .
isaf spokesman captain graham dunlop said the paras has " identified the firing point and they returned fire " .
the same patrol had also found the dead man , he went on , a woman and baby and two other people in the house .
they were all taken to hospital for treatment for injuries and no weapons were found at the house , he said .
