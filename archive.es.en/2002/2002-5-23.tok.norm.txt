sir michael buckley accuses the cabinet office of withholding information and says the home office failed to keep files properly on the " highly sensitive " case . "
this is a challenge to the very heart of the democratic process " norman baker lib dem mp opposition mps have seized on the comments , arguing that it suggests the government had something to hide .
peter mandelson resigned in the hinduja row - which centred around the passports applications of two millennium dome donors - but he has been cleared of wrongdoing .
the ombudsman 's criticisms arise from his investigation into whether the cabinet office and home office broke the rules on open government .
' deep concern ' in a report published on thursday , sir michael complains about the lack of co-operation he got from both departments in that inquiry .
the cabinet office appeared to be " withholding papers " , he says .
" i was deeply concerned about this development , " sir michael continues .
" such a refusal strikes at the very heart of my office 's function . "
the watchdog reports that it took six months for the home office to arrange a contact point so his staff could get the papers he needed to see .
" i am also critical of the home office for their clear failure to maintain their files , on what was a highly sensitive matter , in anything approaching an adequate manner . "
sir michael later received apologies from both departments and was given the papers he had requested .
liberal democrat mp norman baker , said the ombudsman 's report was couched in " unprecedented language " .
' something to hide ? '
" it is a very serious matter that the cabinet office was withholding documents from the ombudsman , " said mr baker .
" this is a challenge to the very heart of the democratic process .
" it also shows that the government , while maintaining on the surface that there was nothing to hide , was paddling away furiously under the water to keep information from the ombudsman . "
sir michael was investigating a complaint by a journalist who had claimed the two departments had refused to give him information about the hinduja case .
the journalist wanted copies from the home office of any letters labour mp keith vaz , then a minister , had written about the srichand and gopichand hinduja .
he also asked for details of a conversation between mr mandelson had with home office minister mike o 'brien about the two brothers ' passport applications .
mr mandelson now disputes that conversation took place and the home office told the ombudsman there were no details of it they could provide to the reporter .
apologies sir michael said the department had been wrong to refuse to provide mr vaz 's one letter on the matter until the hammond inquiry into the hinduja case was finished .
but the journalist had been given a copy of the letter after it was published by the hammond inquiry report .
that point was underlined by a home office spokesman .
but he added : " we accept , however , that there are lessons to be learned in terms of administration and the delays that arose largely due to the need for consultation . "
hinduja inquiries a cabinet office spokesman emphasised its apology for the initial delay in dealing with sir michael 's initial request .
in his second inquiry earlier this year , treasury solicitor sir anthony hammond cleared mr mandelson and mr vaz of wrongdoing in the affair .
but he said it remained " likely " that mr mandelson had telephoned mr o 'brien about the hindujas .
those findings prompted downing street to say that mr mandelson might not have needed to resign had the full details been known from the start .

bbc news online provides a step-by-step guide to the dispute .
why is tension so high ?
the territory has witnessed a number of violent incidents recently against the background of continuing tension between india and pakistan .
gunmen attacked an army camp in indian-controlled kashmir , killing more than 30 people .
india blamed pakistani-backed militants , a charge pakistan rejected .
forces from both countries deployed along the frontline are regularly shelling each other , causing deaths and injuries to civilians in the area .
and a leading moderate kashmiri politician , abdul ghani lone , was murdered at a rally in srinagar , further increasing fears over instability in the region .
is there a real danger of war ?
international concern over the situation in kashmir is growing , and there have been calls for restraint from the us , the eu and others .
uk foreign secretary jack straw is due to visit both india and pakistan as is us assistant secretary of state richard armitage .
the eu commissioner for external relations , chris patten , is already in the region .
there are fears that even a minor incident along the border could trigger a conflagration between the two nuclear-capable powers .
and both president musharraf and prime minister vajpayee are under considerable domestic pressure not to back down in this latest stand-off .
why is kashmir disputed ?
the territory of kashmir was hotly contested even before india and pakistan won their independence from britain in august 1947 .
under the partition plan provided by the indian independence act of 1947 , kashmir was free to accede to india or pakistan .
the maharaja , hari singh , wanted to stay independent but eventually decided to accede to india , signing over key powers to the indian government - in return for military aid and a promised referendum .
since then , the territory has been the flashpoint for two of the three india-pakistan wars : the first in 1947-8 , the second in 1965 .
in 1999 , india fought a brief but bitter conflict with pakistani-backed forces who had infiltrated indian-controlled territory in the kargil area .
in addition to the rival claims of delhi and islamabad to the territory , there has been a growing and often violent separatist movement fighting against indian rule in kashmir since 1989 .
watch a 50-minute special report , presented by phil rees for the bbc 's correspondent programme , on the tensions in kashmir .
what are the rival claims ?
islamabad says kashmir should have become part of pakistan in 1947 , because muslims are in the majority in the region -lrb- see below -rrb- .
pakistan also argues that kashmiris should be allowed to vote in a referendum on their future , following numerous un resolutions on the issue .
delhi , however , does not want international debate on the issue , arguing that the simla agreement of 1972 provided for a resolution through bilateral talks .
india points to the instrument of accession signed in october 1947 by the maharaja , hari singh .
both india and pakistan reject the so-called " third option " of kashmiri independence .
what is the line of control ?
a demarcation line was originally established in january 1949 as a ceasefire line , following the end of the first kashmir war .
in july 1972 , after a second conflict , the line of control -lrb- loc -rrb- was re-established under the terms of the simla agreement , with minor variations on the earlier boundary .
the loc passes through a mountainous region about 5,000 metres high .
india and pakistan trade fire over the loc the conditions are so extreme that the bitter cold claims more lives than the sporadic military skirmishes .
north of the loc , the rival forces have been entrenched on the siachen glacier -lrb- more than 6,000 metres high -rrb- since 1984 - the highest battlefield on earth .
the loc divides kashmir on a two-to-one basis : indian-administered kashmir to the east and south -lrb- population about nine million -rrb- , which falls into the indian state of jammu and kashmir ; and pakistani-administered kashmir to the north and west -lrb- population about three million -rrb- , which is labelled by pakistan as " azad " -lrb- free -rrb- kashmir .
what 's the un involvement ?
the un has maintained a presence in the disputed area since 1949 .
currently , the loc is monitored by the un military observer group in india and pakistan -lrb- unmogip -rrb- .
it is commanded by major-general hermann loidolt of austria .
according to the un , their mission is " to observe , to the extent possible , developments pertaining to the strict observance of the ceasefire of december 1971 " .
is religion an issue ?
religion is an important aspect of the dispute .
partition in 1947 gave india 's muslims a state of their own : pakistan .
so a common faith underpins pakistan 's claims to kashmir , where many areas are muslim-dominated .
the population of the indian state of jammu and kashmir is over 60 % muslim , making it the only state within india where muslims are in the majority .
who are the militants ?
there are several groups pursuing the rival claims to kashmir .
armed kashmiri militants : a growing presence not all are armed , but since muslim insurgency began in 1989 , the number of armed separatists has grown from hundreds to thousands .
the most prominent are the pro-pakistani hizbul mujahideen .
islamabad denies providing them and others with logistical and material support .
the jammu and kashmir liberation front -lrb- jklf -rrb- was the largest pro-independence group , but its influence is thought to have waned .
other groups have joined under the umbrella of the all-party hurriyat -lrb- freedom -rrb- conference , which campaigns peacefully for an end to india 's presence in kashmir .
indian forces announced a unilateral ceasefire against militant groups in november 2000 , but violence continued .
attempts to get talks going between the government and the separatist parties have foundered over separatist demands that pakistan should be included in any dialogue .
india says there can be no discussion involving pakistan because it sponsors violence in kashmir .
india and pakistan failed to narrow their differences over kashmir at a summit in the indian city of agra in july 2001 .
since then , they have continued to trade accusations and outside attempts to get them to resolve their differences have made no headway . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's tom heap " tensions between india and pakistan date back more than 50 years " home when we are on air recent forums programme archive studio tour today 's information meet the team presenters reporters your say contact us your comments full coverage key stories tensions rise again q & a : kashmir dispute dispute origins who are the militants ?

it was the second straight month the trade surplus has risen .
but the economic picture was clouded by the lowest rise in overall exports for four months , up just 0.3 % .
analysts said the figure suggested that any recovery remains fragile , particularly as the us economy is set to grow at a more moderate pace in the next few months after powering ahead between january and march .
yen advantage " if the us recovery is weak , japan will be pushed in the same direction eventually , " said takahiro nakayama of morley fund management in tokyo .
japan 's exports have been helped by the fall in the value of its currency , which traded 6.1 % lower on average last month than in april 2002 .
however , this advantage has been disappearing in recent weeks , as pessimism about the us economy has led to the dollar weakening against other currencies .
regional recovery japanese exports to the rest of asia jumped 93.1 % , as chinese shoppers rushed to buy japanese cars and big manufacturers around the region sucked in industrial raw materials .
" the background for the increase in exports of plastics and other materials is the rebound in asian economies , led by global manufacturers , " a finance ministry official said .
" among the largest contributors were car exports to china , up 97.6 % over the previous year , " he added .
japan 's trade surplus in april totalled 836.7bn yen -lrb- $ 6.7bn -rrb- .
total exports grew 1.6 % to 4,400.7bn yen from april last year , the month that marked the start of recessions in japan and the us .
imports fell 2.9 % to 3,564.1bn yen , the ministry said .
the drop in imports reflected stagnant consumer spending in japan , analysts said . watch / listen on this story ron bevaqua , commerzbank in tokyo " japan has a trade off to make between social stability and greater wealth . "

appearing in court in cambodia 's capital phnom penh , sam bith was charged with kidnapping , conspiring in premeditated murder , terrorism and robbery .
we are very worried about his health police officer sam bith , 69 , looked pale and unwell .
a police officer said he suffered very high blood pressure overnight and two doctors had been assigned to look after him .
the charges relate to a july 1994 ambush of a train by former khmer rouge rebels .
at least 10 cambodians were killed during the attack .
the three foreigners - australian david wilson , frenchman jean-michel braquet and briton mark slater - and several cambodians were taken to the nearby vine mountain rebel base in the southern cambodian province of kampot .
they were killed after negotiations for their release and the payment of a $ 150,000 ransom broke down .
the khmer rouge commander of vine mountain , nuon paet , was jailed for life in june 1999 for his role in the affair .
international concern during his trial , nuon paet said that his superior officer , sam bith , had ordered the tourists killed .

sam bith , who was made a general in the cambodian army after defecting from the khmer rouge in 1996 , was arrested in the north-western province of battambang on wednesday .
a warrant was issued for his arrest in 1999 , but police said they had been unable to find him .

i hope this will be a warning that we mean business leader of oxfordshire council , keith mitchell lawyers for patricia amos , 43 , told oxford crown court the jail term imposed at banbury magistrates ' court nearly two weeks ago was excessive .
they argued that 28 days would have been a more appropriate sentence .
the court agreed .
because she had served half the sentence she was freed .
judge peter crawford qc , who heard the appeal with two magistrates , told amos she had " persistently and deliberately " refused to accept her parental obligations .
unprecedented but he said : " we have taken all the circumstances into account and the sentence of 60 days imprisonment - although justified in principle - we think the sentence was longer than necessary . "
he made it clear to amos that if she went back to the same sort of behaviour when she left prison she might find herself in front of him again .
patricia amos had been sent to prison for failing to ensure that her daughters , emma , 15 , and jackie , 13 , attended lessons at their banbury comprehensive school .
oxfordshire 's keith mitchell : " children need their education " it was believed to be the first time magistrates had passed such a sentence on a parent under powers they gained in november 2000 .
during the appeal hearing louise worton , for the prosecuting authorities , said amos had repeatedly failed to ensure her children attended school and had repeatedly missed meetings with education officials .
she had also breached a parenting order obliging her to ensure the girls attended morning and afternoon registrations at their school .
bereavement from september 2001 to february this year , the court was told , the older daughter , emma , had attended only 55 out of 190 school registrations - a 29 % record .
her younger sister attended 64 of 190 school sessions - a 34 % attendance rate .
paul reid , the barrister acting for amos , told the court that the death of her 63-year-old mother at the family home in 1999 - where she was found by the two teenage girls - had exaggerated the problem of the children 's truancy and had caused " devastation " in the family .
a letter to the court from jennifer wolfendene , a bereavement councillor at holloway prison , said : " the extreme distress experienced by this family after this woman 's death became pathological . "
tough warnings the leader of oxfordshire county council , keith mitchell , said outside the court that the judge had backed its action and it would do the same again if necessary .
" i hope this will be a warning that we mean business , " he said .
" children need their education .
they only have one chance and we will do what we can to ensure they have the best chance . "
a spokesperson for the department for education said : " children must go to school and parents have to play their part in making sure they do .
attendance " we will continue to support parents who need extra help and who work with schools to tackle truancy .
" fifty thousand young people play truant every day and it is absolutely right that we take the tough decisions to reduce this . "
the children have been staying with their eldest sister on the bretch hill estate in banbury .
they are believed to have been attending school regularly since the sentence .
delays technically amos served only 13 days - not the 14 which would have been half the sentence , but holloway agreed to her release following the court hearing .
the appeal proceedings had been delayed because amos was taken from holloway jail to oxford via two other courts .
the appeal court was told at midday that the securicor van had gone to guildford crown court in surrey , then on to high wycombe magistrates ' court in buckinghamshire , to drop off other prisoners .
the judge said that in his view she had been detained unlawfully in the prison van and he would be demanding a full explanation .
" it is the duty for custody authorities to produce prisoners on time for their appearance in court .
i 'm not aware of any legal justification for detaining a person after a time they are required to appear in court , " he said . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's mike baker " patricia amos ' daughters are now back at school " keith mitchell , leader , oxfordshire county council " it was a last resort that we took her to court " the bbc 's richard lister at oxford crown court " it seems that the judge has come up with a ruling that will go some way to satisfying both sides " talking point child truancy should parents be held responsible ?

"
i hope this will be a warning that we mean business " leader of oxfordshire council , keith mitchell lawyers for patricia amos , 43 , told oxford crown court the jail term imposed at banbury magistrates ' court nearly two weeks ago was excessive .
they argued that 28 days would have been a more appropriate sentence .
the court agreed .
because she had served half the sentence she was freed .
judge peter crawford qc , who heard the appeal with two magistrates , told amos she had " persistently and deliberately " refused to accept her parental obligations .
unprecedented but he said : " we have taken all the circumstances into account and the sentence of 60 days imprisonment - although justified in principle - we think the sentence was longer than necessary . "
he made it clear to amos that if she went back to the same sort of behaviour when she left prison she might find herself in front of him again .
patricia amos had been sent to prison for failing to ensure that her daughters , emma , 15 , and jackie , 13 , attended lessons at their banbury comprehensive school .
it was believed to be the first time magistrates had passed such a sentence on a parent under powers they gained in november 2000 .
during the appeal hearing louise worton , for the prosecuting authorities , said amos had repeatedly failed to ensure her children attended school and had repeatedly missed meetings with education officials .
she had also breached a parenting order obliging her to ensure the girls attended morning and afternoon registrations at their school .
bereavement from september 2001 to february this year , the court was told , the older daughter , emma , had attended only 55 out of 190 school registrations - a 29 % record .
her younger sister attended 64 of 190 school sessions - a 34 % attendance rate .
paul reid , the barrister acting for amos , told the court that the death of her 63-year-old mother at the family home in 1999 - where she was found by the two teenage girls - had exaggerated the problem of the children 's truancy and had caused " devastation " in the family .
a letter to the court from jennifer wolfendene , a bereavement councillor at holloway prison , said : " the extreme distress experienced by this family after this woman 's death became pathological . "
tough warnings the leader of oxfordshire county council , keith mitchell , said outside the court that the judge had backed its action and it would do the same again if necessary .
" i hope this will be a warning that we mean business , " he said .
" children need their education .
they only have one chance and we will do what we can to ensure they have the best chance . "
a spokesperson for the department for education said : " children must go to school and parents have to play their part in making sure they do .
attendance " we will continue to support parents who need extra help and who work with schools to tackle truancy .
" fifty thousand young people play truant every day and it is absolutely right that we take the tough decisions to reduce this . "
the children have been staying with their eldest sister on the bretch hill estate in banbury .
they are believed to have been attending school regularly since the sentence .
delays technically amos served only 13 days - not the 14 which would have been half the sentence , but holloway agreed to her release following the court hearing .
the appeal proceedings had been delayed because amos was taken from holloway jail to oxford via two other courts .
the appeal court was told at midday that the securicor van had gone to guildford crown court in surrey , then on to high wycombe magistrates ' court in buckinghamshire , to drop off other prisoners .
the judge said that in his view she had been detained unlawfully in the prison van and he would be demanding a full explanation .
" it is the duty for custody authorities to produce prisoners on time for their appearance in court .
i 'm not aware of any legal justification for detaining a person after a time they are required to appear in court , " he said .

the de montford university-led study into alternative ways of voting aimed to root out barriers to e-voting in a bid to offer an e-enabled general election sometime after 2006 .
trials on 2.5 million potential voters carried out at the local elections earlier this month found that in some areas , like two wards in liverpool , turnout increased from 20.71 % to 27.49 % .
but in newham , where electronic voting and e-counting were trialled , turnout fell by 0.4 % to 27.6 % .
abuse safeguards local government minister nick raynsford said the sole purpose of the research was to make it easier for people to vote .
" this was an important stage in the government programme to test alternative ways of voting that may make it easier for people to exercise their democratic rights , " he said .
" any changes to the voting system must be properly researched to ensure that they are of real benefit to the public , as well as incorporating effective safeguards against abuse .

" i believe the pilots were a success .
the postal voting pilots clearly did have a positive impact on the level of turn out . "
resistance mr raynsford said the e-voting was found to be easy to use and more than 10 % of those who voted in swindon , voted by internet - higher than those who voted by post .
dr laurence pratchett , who led the research , said : " there is support for e-voting in the population , even among those who wo n't use it .
" a lot of older people in the focus groups said that they would n't use electronic voting , but they could n't see why others should n't use it . "
but he added : " there were significant pockets of resistance . "
the use of cash and lottery machines were seen as " non starters as far as the public is concerned " , said dr pratchett .
public confidence the affect of e-voting on the numbers of people going to the polls is likely to be " minimal " .
" those who do n't vote are no more likely to vote , " he said .
dr pratchett said some people felt e-voting disconnected the voter from the system even further .
the survey said widescale remote voting by electronic means should not be embarked on until issues of secrecy , security and public confidence in the different voting methods were addressed .
electors should be able to choose from a range of ways to vote , including the traditional polling station , to suit their commitments and lifestyles , it added .
mr raynsford said e-voting would make it easier for local authorities to test public views instantly on issues , including the rate of council tax .
ben fairweather , from de montford university , said e-voting needed to be designed to detect hacking immediately .
postal voting in may 's local elections was reported to have increased by 28 % , while e-voting increased by 5 % and online voting by 1 % .
local government secretary stephen byers suggested on tuesday that the 2004 european elections could be the first nationwide all-postal vote .

petty criminals should be serving community sentences , martin narey told breakfast this morning .
spending a couple of months in jail means that offenders lose their jobs , but fail to benefit from the long term training or rehabilitation that prisons can offer .
narey : community punishments would be better mr narey was responding to a series of special reports on prison overcrowding which we 've been running this week on bbc breakfast .
yesterday graham satchell reported on a day in the life of wormwood scrubs prison in west london. click here to read about wormwood scrubs in an outspoken interview , martin narey , the director general of the prison service said : when we have prisoners for long enough , we can make a real difference : we can get them off drugs , for instance .
" but , sending someone to prison for just a few months , which means they stay with us a few weeks , is just a waste of public money . "
" if the aim is to reduce crime , i want to say very publicly that it 's much more effective to put someone on community penalty than to ssend them to pirson .
" if you send someone to us for a few weeks , it will do nothing to reduce crime at all , and it will distract us from doing constructive work with our other prisoners to make them less dangerous. click here to watch martin narey 's interview in full watch / listen on this story do n't jail petty offenders , says narey home when we are on air recent forums programme archive studio tour today 's information meet the team presenters reporters your say contact us your comments e-mail this story to a friend links to more breakfast stories in this section running the red soak the rich metrosexual man casualty 's big day rail passengers face above inflation rise the truth about nanotechnology hoover street revival hitchcock blonde when violence begins at home more children suffering from eating disorders calling time on licensing laws the lessons of the trupti patel case open all hours ^ ^ back to top news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes - to bbc sport > > -pipe- to bbc weather > > -pipe- to bbc world service > > - © mmiii -pipe- news sources -pipe- privacy

i think ari is a good man for princess martha - i 'll be watching from outside the cathedral on friday isabel moser 11-year-old norwegian flags are everywhere and specially selected flowers in green and white decorate all public spaces , in anticipation of friday 's wedding between princess martha louise and author ari behn .
more than 500 representatives from international media scurry up and down the street in the sweltering sun , hoping with everyone else the clear blue skies stay until the end of the week .
the official wedding colours - a much-debated combination of mint and pink - are starting to appear in the shape of banners and shop front window decorations .
short book list in is only 9 months since crown prince haakon magnus married mette marit in oslo .
the crown prince 's choice was seen by many as controversial .
mette marit was a single mother who admitted to a past where she had been in contact with drugs .
the crown prince also chose a controversial spouse now the crown prince 's sister is facing criticism for her own choice of life partner .
mr behn is the author of only one book - the 90 pages long " sad as hell " .
he hit the headlines in norway after making a tv documentary in which he was seen partying with prostitutes who were using cocaine .
an opinion poll early this week showed 43 % of norwegian feel the young royals ' choice of partners has weakened the monarchy .
happy to have them but there is little sign of discontent with the royals and the groom-to-be in trondheim .
it is great that they chose to come here to marry malfrid riseth flower stall owner this is a small city of 150,000 people , and a large part of society has in some way or other been taking part in the preparations for friday 's event .
all the children of the city have been asked to pick wild white flowers and to decorate the square in front of the nidaros cathedral , where the wedding ceremony will take place .
" i think ari is a good man for princess martha .
i 'll be watching from outside the cathedral on friday " , 11-year-old isabel moser told bbc news online .
in the square between the cathedral and the royal residence , malfrid riseth is setting up her flower stall with excitement .
" it is great that they chose to come here to marry , " she said .
" and i think ari behn is getting better and better , the more we get to know him .
i think she 's made a good choice . "
trondheim mayor liv sandven says she has put most political decision-making aside this week .
" it 's a hectic and happening week .
yesterday we had a meeting on oil policies , but apart from that it has been all about the wedding " , she said while trying on her new ballroom gown in green thai silk .
wedding cake in danger not all preparations have gone smoothly though .
last week a strike by hotel and catering staff threatened both the wedding cake and accommodation for royalty and other guests alike .
but agreement was reached just in time , so by friday norway will be able to enjoy what is probably the last royal wedding of this generation - cake and all .
