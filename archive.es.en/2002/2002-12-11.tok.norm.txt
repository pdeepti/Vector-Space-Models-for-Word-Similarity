trade unions are up in arms . good news for ardent shoppers in germany : as early as next month , a new law could be in place enabling shops to open until 8pm on saturdays - four hours more than allowed under present rules . following proposals made by german economics minister wolfgang clement last week , the cabinet on wednesday endorsed the draft law .
chancellor gerhard schröder said he hoped it would boost retail spending .
" the discussion took about three minutes , " he said . "
no one in the cabinet had any difficulty supporting the draft .
we hope that the reticence in retail spending in germany will come to an end , he said . " provided it is passed in parliament , the new law could go into effect as early as january .
under current german law on opening hours which was last reformed in 1956 , retail businesses are only allowed to open until 4pm on saturdays and there is a far-reaching ban on shops opening on sundays and on public holidays . despite massive resistance from trade unions representing the service industry in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder is standing by his minister .
“ the chancellor has said he would welcome shops being able to open until 8pm instead of 4pm in the future , ” a government spokesperson said . both the greens and the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are also for the longer opening hours .
green mp , franziska eichstädt-bohlig proposed that the new law should go further , allowing shops in the center of towns and cities to open until 10pm every day , should they wish . even the oppositon christian democrats along with their fdp coalition partners in saxony anhalt have already proposed that saturday opening hours be extended to 6pm in the state . ‘ not in citizens ’ interest ’ but trade unions are furious about the new plans .
ver.di , the trade union which represents service industry workers in germany maintained in a statement that longer opening hours wouldn ’ t aid economic growth or employment .
the change would result in huge job cuts in the retail sector , as business struggle to reduce their costs in the face of increased competition , they said in the statement . “ it is absurd that the government says they want – on the one hand , to champion unemployment , but on the other hand , with a lengthening of shop opening hours will unleash a process that will destroy thousands of jobs , ” one of the heads of ver.di , franziska wiethold said . ver.di boss , frank bsirske added in a reuters interview that he “ rejected ” the proposed changes , saying they were not “ in citizens ’ interest ” .
ver.di has said if the government is really serious about the changes , then they will have to reckon with huge resistance from the union sector . but whether the new law will actually be successful remains questionable .

moshe katsav was full of praise for germany , a close ally of his country for decades .
he thanked the german government for its support for israel and for its efforts to combat antisemitism and extremism .
still , katsav described as " terrible " a resurgence of anti-semitism in europe and particularly in germany , where the holocaust had destroyed so many jewish people .
although they were only a small minority , he said , " one never knows how many people will allow themselves to be influenced . "
more military hardware on the cards the issue of the supply of german military hardware to israel dominated talks on monday between katsav and the german chancellor .
after the meeting , schröder announced that his government had not ruled out expanded military support for israel .

-lrb- ap photo / ho -rrb- schröder reiterated germany 's willingness to supply israel with us-built patriot missiles , and said " other assistance " had also been discussed , but he was tight-lipped about the details of any further military aid .
katsav himself has remained reticent about israel 's wish-list , although he has said he still expects the fuchs armored troop carriers requested by israel to be delivered .
over the weekend , katsav did not rule out the possibility that the tanks would be used against " palestinian terrorists " .
the decision whether germany will go ahead with the supply of the tanks still hangs in the balance .
katsav 's failure to deny that they could be used in operations in palestinian areas has worried opponents of the move , especially the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens .
the defence minister peter struck has repeatedly said germany ca n't spare the fuchs tanks .
that assertion will have little bearing on the final ruling by the federal committee on security .
it 's being seen as an attempt to avoid embarrassment should the decision go against israel .
a symbolic visit though brief , katsav 's visit was heavy with symbolism .
on sunday he became the first israeli president to consecrate a german synagogue in a ceremony in wuppertal described by the german chancellor gerhard schröder , as " moving " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.12.2002 discontent in chancellor schröder 's party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure - german chancellor gerhard schröder an unfortunate remark by the german chancellor has prompted rumors about his resignation and exposed rifts within the social democrats .
it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .
nagging issue of captial gains tax raises its head again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier of lower saxony sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on tuesday , the spd premier of the state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel -lrb- photo -rrb- reasserted the resolve of spd-ruled states to reintroduce the capital gains tax , which is fiercely opposed by chancellor schröder .
schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .
the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principle that the state must not take more than half of any citizen ’ s income .
gabriel also rejected criticism that the reintroduction of the capital gains tax would scare away investors .
most of the spd-ruled states that are pressing for a reintroduction of the tax argue that it would generate around 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
gabriel announced on tuesday in parliament that he plans to introduce the issue of the 1 percent capital gains tax in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in january .

" all those who had hoped for that , are wrong .

eager to play down the differences within the spd over the controversial capital gains tax , schröder said , " it has to be clear that in the end only that will happen , what the german chancellor and the party chairman believe to be right . "
schröder calls for unity with eye on elections schröder also called upon his party to unite in the face of upcoming elections in the states of lower saxony and hessen on february 2 , 2003 .

it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .
nagging issue of captial gains tax raises its head again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier of lower saxony sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on tuesday , the spd premier of the state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel -lrb- photo -rrb- reasserted the resolve of spd-ruled states to reintroduce the capital gains tax , which is fiercely opposed by chancellor schröder .
schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .

but the cap has failed .
larger farms are paid not to produce , while smaller ones have come to heavily rely on subsidies . reform of the common agricultural policy has become urgent , because the accession of central european countries threatens to break the bank .
farming subsidies in the european union already account for about half of the eu ’ s entire budget – not including the new members .
european farming receives a staggering $ 39 billion a year in direct subsidies - more than the rest of industry combined . franz fischler , the eu 's agriculture minister , outlined proposals for cap reform , according to which farmers would no longer be paid to over-produce .
instead , they would get flat payments , which would be progressively cut back .
the money saved would instead be redirected towards rural development . predictably , the plan met with opposition from the big beneficiaries of the cap : france , spain , greece and ireland .
farm lobbies in those countries fear they would not be able to survive in an unprotected global market .
they have made clear they would fight to prevent a reform that might cost them money . on the other side are countries like germany and the netherlands , which recently argued that if the cap was not reformed before the eu expands eastwards , farm spending would swell by a further $ 20 billion a year in a few years ’ time .
they are determined to keep pressing .

trade unions are up in arms . good news for ardent shoppers in germany : as early as next month , a new law could be in place enabling shops to open until 8pm on saturdays - four hours more than allowed under present rules . following proposals made by german economics minister wolfgang clement last week , the cabinet on wednesday endorsed the draft law .
chancellor gerhard schröder said he hoped it would boost retail spending .
" the discussion took about three minutes , " he said . "
no one in the cabinet had any difficulty supporting the draft .
we hope that the reticence in retail spending in germany will come to an end , he said . " provided it is passed in parliament , the new law could go into effect as early as january .
under current german law on opening hours which was last reformed in 1956 , retail businesses are only allowed to open until 4pm on saturdays and there is a far-reaching ban on shops opening on sundays and on public holidays . despite massive resistance from trade unions representing the service industry in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder is standing by his minister .
“ the chancellor has said he would welcome shops being able to open until 8pm instead of 4pm in the future , ” a government spokesperson said . both the greens and the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are also for the longer opening hours .
green mp , franziska eichstädt-bohlig proposed that the new law should go further , allowing shops in the center of towns and cities to open until 10pm every day , should they wish . even the oppositon christian democrats along with their fdp coalition partners in saxony anhalt have already proposed that saturday opening hours be extended to 6pm in the state . ‘ not in citizens ’ interest ’ but trade unions are furious about the new plans .
ver.di , the trade union which represents service industry workers in germany maintained in a statement that longer opening hours wouldn ’ t aid economic growth or employment .
the change would result in huge job cuts in the retail sector , as business struggle to reduce their costs in the face of increased competition , they said in the statement . “ it is absurd that the government says they want – on the one hand , to champion unemployment , but on the other hand , with a lengthening of shop opening hours will unleash a process that will destroy thousands of jobs , ” one of the heads of ver.di , franziska wiethold said . ver.di boss , frank bsirske added in a reuters interview that he “ rejected ” the proposed changes , saying they were not “ in citizens ’ interest ” .
ver.di has said if the government is really serious about the changes , then they will have to reckon with huge resistance from the union sector . but whether the new law will actually be successful remains questionable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.12.2002 israel , germany defuse dispute over arms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel and germany - their past and future inextricably linked relations between israel and germany have remained intact after a visit by israel 's head of state , moshe katsav , despite recent tensions over the supply of military hardware . as the israeli president wrapped up a three-day visit with final official appearances on tuesday , there was little sign of the tension that has characterized the relationship with his hosts in recent weeks .
moshe katsav was full of praise for germany , a close ally of his country for decades .
he thanked the german government for its support for israel and for its efforts to combat antisemitism and extremism .
still , katsav described as " terrible " a resurgence of anti-semitism in europe and particularly in germany , where the holocaust had destroyed so many jewish people .
although they were only a small minority , he said , " one never knows how many people will allow themselves to be influenced . "
more military hardware on the cards the issue of the supply of german military hardware to israel dominated talks on monday between katsav and the german chancellor .
after the meeting , schröder announced that his government had not ruled out expanded military support for israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handout-foto zeigt den deutschen spuerpanzer " fuchs " .
der einsatz deutscher spuerpanzer im irakischen grenzgebiet ist nicht ausgeschlossen , sagte der stellvertretende vorsitzende des auswaertigen ausschusses im bundestag , hans-ullrich klose , der ' bild ' -zeitung vom samstag , 23.nov.
2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / ho -rrb- schröder reiterated germany 's willingness to supply israel with us-built patriot missiles , and said " other assistance " had also been discussed , but he was tight-lipped about the details of any further military aid .
katsav himself has remained reticent about israel 's wish-list , although he has said he still expects the fuchs armored troop carriers requested by israel to be delivered .
over the weekend , katsav did not rule out the possibility that the tanks would be used against " palestinian terrorists " .
the decision whether germany will go ahead with the supply of the tanks still hangs in the balance .
katsav 's failure to deny that they could be used in operations in palestinian areas has worried opponents of the move , especially the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens .
the defence minister peter struck has repeatedly said germany ca n't spare the fuchs tanks .
that assertion will have little bearing on the final ruling by the federal committee on security .
it 's being seen as an attempt to avoid embarrassment should the decision go against israel .
a symbolic visit though brief , katsav 's visit was heavy with symbolism .
on sunday he became the first israeli president to consecrate a german synagogue in a ceremony in wuppertal described by the german chancellor gerhard schröder , as " moving " .

-lrb- ap photo / str -rrb- katsav 's official duties also included a visit to a former concentration camp at sachsenhausen outside berlin , and a speech before berlin 's jewish community , in which he stressed israel 's right to defend itself against palestinian terrorism .
demonstrations " a disgrace " german neo-nazis marching through berlin on monday failed to cast a shadow over the israeli president 's visit .
about 100 supporters of the far-right npd demonstrated , holding up banners saying " hands off palestine – no german weapons for israel " .
several hundred anti-nazi demonstrators were also gathered along the protest route , kept apart from the right-wingers by a police cordon .
germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer described the demonstrations as " a disgrace " .

moshe katsav was full of praise for germany , a close ally of his country for decades .
he thanked the german government for its support for israel and for its efforts to combat antisemitism and extremism .
still , katsav described as " terrible " a resurgence of anti-semitism in europe and particularly in germany , where the holocaust had destroyed so many jewish people .
although they were only a small minority , he said , " one never knows how many people will allow themselves to be influenced . "
more military hardware on the cards the issue of the supply of german military hardware to israel dominated talks on monday between katsav and the german chancellor .
after the meeting , schröder announced that his government had not ruled out expanded military support for israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handout-foto zeigt den deutschen spuerpanzer " fuchs " .
der einsatz deutscher spuerpanzer im irakischen grenzgebiet ist nicht ausgeschlossen , sagte der stellvertretende vorsitzende des auswaertigen ausschusses im bundestag , hans-ullrich klose , der ' bild ' -zeitung vom samstag , 23.nov.
2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / ho -rrb- schröder reiterated germany 's willingness to supply israel with us-built patriot missiles , and said " other assistance " had also been discussed , but he was tight-lipped about the details of any further military aid .
katsav himself has remained reticent about israel 's wish-list , although he has said he still expects the fuchs armored troop carriers requested by israel to be delivered .
over the weekend , katsav did not rule out the possibility that the tanks would be used against " palestinian terrorists " .
the decision whether germany will go ahead with the supply of the tanks still hangs in the balance .
katsav 's failure to deny that they could be used in operations in palestinian areas has worried opponents of the move , especially the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens .
the defence minister peter struck has repeatedly said germany ca n't spare the fuchs tanks .
that assertion will have little bearing on the final ruling by the federal committee on security .
it 's being seen as an attempt to avoid embarrassment should the decision go against israel .
a symbolic visit though brief , katsav 's visit was heavy with symbolism .
on sunday he became the first israeli president to consecrate a german synagogue in a ceremony in wuppertal described by the german chancellor gerhard schröder , as " moving " .

-lrb- ap photo / str -rrb- katsav 's official duties also included a visit to a former concentration camp at sachsenhausen outside berlin , and a speech before berlin 's jewish community , in which he stressed israel 's right to defend itself against palestinian terrorism .
demonstrations " a disgrace " german neo-nazis marching through berlin on monday failed to cast a shadow over the israeli president 's visit .
about 100 supporters of the far-right npd demonstrated , holding up banners saying " hands off palestine – no german weapons for israel " .
several hundred anti-nazi demonstrators were also gathered along the protest route , kept apart from the right-wingers by a police cordon .
germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer described the demonstrations as " a disgrace " .
after germany , the israeli president heads to italy for meetings with the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and pope john paul ii , with whom he will discuss the israeli army presence in the west bank town of bethlehem . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israel arms request creates dilemma for germany chancellor schröder finds himself caught between an israeli government expecting promised tanks and homegrown opposition against offensive deployment as the fuchs armored vehicle affair rolls on .

trade unions are up in arms . good news for ardent shoppers in germany : as early as next month , a new law could be in place enabling shops to open until 8pm on saturdays - four hours more than allowed under present rules . following proposals made by german economics minister wolfgang clement last week , the cabinet on wednesday endorsed the draft law .
chancellor gerhard schröder said he hoped it would boost retail spending .
" the discussion took about three minutes , " he said . "
no one in the cabinet had any difficulty supporting the draft .
we hope that the reticence in retail spending in germany will come to an end , he said . " provided it is passed in parliament , the new law could go into effect as early as january .
under current german law on opening hours which was last reformed in 1956 , retail businesses are only allowed to open until 4pm on saturdays and there is a far-reaching ban on shops opening on sundays and on public holidays . despite massive resistance from trade unions representing the service industry in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder is standing by his minister .
“ the chancellor has said he would welcome shops being able to open until 8pm instead of 4pm in the future , ” a government spokesperson said . both the greens and the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are also for the longer opening hours .
green mp , franziska eichstädt-bohlig proposed that the new law should go further , allowing shops in the center of towns and cities to open until 10pm every day , should they wish . even the oppositon christian democrats along with their fdp coalition partners in saxony anhalt have already proposed that saturday opening hours be extended to 6pm in the state . ‘ not in citizens ’ interest ’ but trade unions are furious about the new plans .
ver.di , the trade union which represents service industry workers in germany maintained in a statement that longer opening hours wouldn ’ t aid economic growth or employment .
the change would result in huge job cuts in the retail sector , as business struggle to reduce their costs in the face of increased competition , they said in the statement . “ it is absurd that the government says they want – on the one hand , to champion unemployment , but on the other hand , with a lengthening of shop opening hours will unleash a process that will destroy thousands of jobs , ” one of the heads of ver.di , franziska wiethold said . ver.di boss , frank bsirske added in a reuters interview that he “ rejected ” the proposed changes , saying they were not “ in citizens ’ interest ” .

but the cap has failed .
larger farms are paid not to produce , while smaller ones have come to heavily rely on subsidies . reform of the common agricultural policy has become urgent , because the accession of central european countries threatens to break the bank .
farming subsidies in the european union already account for about half of the eu ’ s entire budget – not including the new members .
european farming receives a staggering $ 39 billion a year in direct subsidies - more than the rest of industry combined . franz fischler , the eu 's agriculture minister , outlined proposals for cap reform , according to which farmers would no longer be paid to over-produce .
instead , they would get flat payments , which would be progressively cut back .
the money saved would instead be redirected towards rural development . predictably , the plan met with opposition from the big beneficiaries of the cap : france , spain , greece and ireland .
farm lobbies in those countries fear they would not be able to survive in an unprotected global market .
they have made clear they would fight to prevent a reform that might cost them money . on the other side are countries like germany and the netherlands , which recently argued that if the cap was not reformed before the eu expands eastwards , farm spending would swell by a further $ 20 billion a year in a few years ’ time .

but the cap has failed .
larger farms are paid not to produce , while smaller ones have come to heavily rely on subsidies . reform of the common agricultural policy has become urgent , because the accession of central european countries threatens to break the bank .
farming subsidies in the european union already account for about half of the eu ’ s entire budget – not including the new members .
european farming receives a staggering $ 39 billion a year in direct subsidies - more than the rest of industry combined . franz fischler , the eu 's agriculture minister , outlined proposals for cap reform , according to which farmers would no longer be paid to over-produce .
instead , they would get flat payments , which would be progressively cut back .
the money saved would instead be redirected towards rural development . predictably , the plan met with opposition from the big beneficiaries of the cap : france , spain , greece and ireland .
farm lobbies in those countries fear they would not be able to survive in an unprotected global market .
they have made clear they would fight to prevent a reform that might cost them money . on the other side are countries like germany and the netherlands , which recently argued that if the cap was not reformed before the eu expands eastwards , farm spending would swell by a further $ 20 billion a year in a few years ’ time .
they are determined to keep pressing .

many of the candidate countries are worried that they will do better in 2003 , during which they receive aid from the eu for accession , than when they officially join in 2004 . wary of the trend and eager to solve the financial dispute , the current president of the eu , denmark , proposed a sweetened financial package in late november . the new package addresses the agriculture subsidy concern by creating loopholes that would greatly increase the amount of money polish farmers , for example , receive .
under earlier proposals , the new countries would get only 25 percent of the subsidies current member states receive from the 39 billion euro eu agricultural budget .
under the new plan have access to up to 40 percent of the eu average between 2004 and 2006 .

farming subsidies in the european union already account for about half of the eu ’ s entire budget – not including the new members .
european farming receives a staggering $ 39 billion a year in direct subsidies - more than the rest of industry combined . franz fischler , the eu 's agriculture minister , outlined proposals for cap reform , according to which farmers would no longer be paid to over-produce .
instead , they would get flat payments , which would be progressively cut back .
the money saved would instead be redirected towards rural development . predictably , the plan met with opposition from the big beneficiaries of the cap : france , spain , greece and ireland .
farm lobbies in those countries fear they would not be able to survive in an unprotected global market .
they have made clear they would fight to prevent a reform that might cost them money . on the other side are countries like germany and the netherlands , which recently argued that if the cap was not reformed before the eu expands eastwards , farm spending would swell by a further $ 20 billion a year in a few years ’ time .
they are determined to keep pressing .

now , the baltic nation is on track for accession to the european union . since emerging from behind the iron curtain in 1990 , latvia has lobbied hard for eu membership . reforming its economy took priority in the mid-1990s , and latvia began boasting sizeable growth rates each year .
the rates hovered around 4 percent and have recently been booming .
a growth rate of more than 7 percent , tops in the baltic states , is expected this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's flag but amid the good news , unemployment remains a major problem .
some eastern regions of the country have rates reaching close to 20 percent , though the country 's average is 7.8 percent , according to latvian economics ministry statistics . the problematic economy was one of the main reasons the european union passed over latvia for its “ first wave ” of membership in 1998 , a major disappointment for many in the government . since then , latvia has dismantled much of its soviet-era planned economic policies and moved its ideology closer to the west .
the country earned high praise for its efforts when it managed to report positive growth rates during the russian economic crisis in the late 1990s . nevertheless , brussels has continued urging more reform , particularly in liberalizing former state-owned companies , and streamlining a large bureaucracy . not all of the eu ’ s suggestions are economic .
latvia ’ s social system is also in need of tweaking . linguistic limbo only a little more than half of the population is actually true-blue latvian .
most of the minority are made up of russian-speakers , caught in linguistic and diplomatic limbo ever since the collapse of the soviet union . the government in riga has recently taken steps to ensure more rights for russian-speakers and better integrate them into society through language programs .
in 1998 , the pro-eu government removed language requirements in the election law , guaranteeing the minority new voting rights . brussels has also praised latvia ’ s commitment to further human rights , such as riga ’ s move to abolish the death penalty in 1999 . last october ’ s elections put a new government in place , spelling the end of prime minister andris berzins term as prime minister .
but as all parties were in favor of both eu and nato accession , the country remained on track . the populace is a little less sure .
concern that nato and eu will be too expensive for the country of 2.4 million is one of the major reasons public opinion of accession in both alliances has rated low .

but the cap has failed .
larger farms are paid not to produce , while smaller ones have come to heavily rely on subsidies . reform of the common agricultural policy has become urgent , because the accession of central european countries threatens to break the bank .
farming subsidies in the european union already account for about half of the eu ’ s entire budget – not including the new members .
european farming receives a staggering $ 39 billion a year in direct subsidies - more than the rest of industry combined . franz fischler , the eu 's agriculture minister , outlined proposals for cap reform , according to which farmers would no longer be paid to over-produce .
instead , they would get flat payments , which would be progressively cut back .
the money saved would instead be redirected towards rural development . predictably , the plan met with opposition from the big beneficiaries of the cap : france , spain , greece and ireland .
farm lobbies in those countries fear they would not be able to survive in an unprotected global market .
they have made clear they would fight to prevent a reform that might cost them money . on the other side are countries like germany and the netherlands , which recently argued that if the cap was not reformed before the eu expands eastwards , farm spending would swell by a further $ 20 billion a year in a few years ’ time .

it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .
nagging issue of captial gains tax raises its head again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier of lower saxony sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on tuesday , the spd premier of the state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel -lrb- photo -rrb- reasserted the resolve of spd-ruled states to reintroduce the capital gains tax , which is fiercely opposed by chancellor schröder .
schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .
the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principle that the state must not take more than half of any citizen ’ s income .
gabriel also rejected criticism that the reintroduction of the capital gains tax would scare away investors .
most of the spd-ruled states that are pressing for a reintroduction of the tax argue that it would generate around 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
gabriel announced on tuesday in parliament that he plans to introduce the issue of the 1 percent capital gains tax in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in january .

recent days have seen demonstrations and threats of strikes by registered doctors and medical practitioners against the spd ’ s proposed reforms to the health sector .
sceptical voices within the spd gabriel has n't been the only doubting voice within the spd ranks .
schröder ’ s categorical " no " to the introduction of the capital gains tax last week prompted much surprise within his party .
though his opposition to the tax was well known , his pronounced rejection of it ran counter to the spd states ‘ long-planned proposals to reintroduce the tax and took many by surprise .
even the chancellor ’ s outburst on monday during his party meeting , as he engaged in a verbal duel with parliamentary group leader franz müntefering was described by many present as " overbearing and arrogant " .

" the chancellor will not leave the ship , " he said .
" all those who had hoped for that , are wrong .
and all those who would have been disappointed , can be happy about it . "
eager to play down the differences within the spd over the controversial capital gains tax , schröder said , " it has to be clear that in the end only that will happen , what the german chancellor and the party chairman believe to be right . "
schröder calls for unity with eye on elections schröder also called upon his party to unite in the face of upcoming elections in the states of lower saxony and hessen on february 2 , 2003 .
" within the party one can discuss heatedly , but one must speak with one voice outside .
it ’ s my duty to make sure that happens , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.12.2002 israel , germany defuse dispute over arms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel and germany - their past and future inextricably linked relations between israel and germany have remained intact after a visit by israel 's head of state , moshe katsav , despite recent tensions over the supply of military hardware . as the israeli president wrapped up a three-day visit with final official appearances on tuesday , there was little sign of the tension that has characterized the relationship with his hosts in recent weeks .
moshe katsav was full of praise for germany , a close ally of his country for decades .
he thanked the german government for its support for israel and for its efforts to combat antisemitism and extremism .
still , katsav described as " terrible " a resurgence of anti-semitism in europe and particularly in germany , where the holocaust had destroyed so many jewish people .
although they were only a small minority , he said , " one never knows how many people will allow themselves to be influenced . "
more military hardware on the cards the issue of the supply of german military hardware to israel dominated talks on monday between katsav and the german chancellor .
after the meeting , schröder announced that his government had not ruled out expanded military support for israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handout-foto zeigt den deutschen spuerpanzer " fuchs " .
der einsatz deutscher spuerpanzer im irakischen grenzgebiet ist nicht ausgeschlossen , sagte der stellvertretende vorsitzende des auswaertigen ausschusses im bundestag , hans-ullrich klose , der ' bild ' -zeitung vom samstag , 23.nov.
2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / ho -rrb- schröder reiterated germany 's willingness to supply israel with us-built patriot missiles , and said " other assistance " had also been discussed , but he was tight-lipped about the details of any further military aid .
katsav himself has remained reticent about israel 's wish-list , although he has said he still expects the fuchs armored troop carriers requested by israel to be delivered .
over the weekend , katsav did not rule out the possibility that the tanks would be used against " palestinian terrorists " .
the decision whether germany will go ahead with the supply of the tanks still hangs in the balance .
katsav 's failure to deny that they could be used in operations in palestinian areas has worried opponents of the move , especially the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens .
the defence minister peter struck has repeatedly said germany ca n't spare the fuchs tanks .
that assertion will have little bearing on the final ruling by the federal committee on security .
it 's being seen as an attempt to avoid embarrassment should the decision go against israel .
a symbolic visit though brief , katsav 's visit was heavy with symbolism .
on sunday he became the first israeli president to consecrate a german synagogue in a ceremony in wuppertal described by the german chancellor gerhard schröder , as " moving " .

-lrb- ap photo / str -rrb- katsav 's official duties also included a visit to a former concentration camp at sachsenhausen outside berlin , and a speech before berlin 's jewish community , in which he stressed israel 's right to defend itself against palestinian terrorism .
demonstrations " a disgrace " german neo-nazis marching through berlin on monday failed to cast a shadow over the israeli president 's visit .
about 100 supporters of the far-right npd demonstrated , holding up banners saying " hands off palestine – no german weapons for israel " .
several hundred anti-nazi demonstrators were also gathered along the protest route , kept apart from the right-wingers by a police cordon .
germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer described the demonstrations as " a disgrace " .

it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .
nagging issue of captial gains tax raises its head again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier of lower saxony sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on tuesday , the spd premier of the state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel -lrb- photo -rrb- reasserted the resolve of spd-ruled states to reintroduce the capital gains tax , which is fiercely opposed by chancellor schröder .
schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .
the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principle that the state must not take more than half of any citizen ’ s income .
gabriel also rejected criticism that the reintroduction of the capital gains tax would scare away investors .
most of the spd-ruled states that are pressing for a reintroduction of the tax argue that it would generate around 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
gabriel announced on tuesday in parliament that he plans to introduce the issue of the 1 percent capital gains tax in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in january .
spd too meek in policy-making ?

taking a dig at chancellor schröder ’ s traditionally close relationship to labor unions , he said that the spd shouldn ’ t " fear demonstrations " and " we shouldn ’ t duck from lobbyists . "
recent days have seen demonstrations and threats of strikes by registered doctors and medical practitioners against the spd ’ s proposed reforms to the health sector .
sceptical voices within the spd gabriel has n't been the only doubting voice within the spd ranks .
schröder ’ s categorical " no " to the introduction of the capital gains tax last week prompted much surprise within his party .
though his opposition to the tax was well known , his pronounced rejection of it ran counter to the spd states ‘ long-planned proposals to reintroduce the tax and took many by surprise .
even the chancellor ’ s outburst on monday during his party meeting , as he engaged in a verbal duel with parliamentary group leader franz müntefering was described by many present as " overbearing and arrogant " .
one party member told the berliner zeitung that the atmosphere at the meeting was " resigned " and that the spd leadership had a " orientation problem " .

" the chancellor will not leave the ship , " he said .
" all those who had hoped for that , are wrong .
and all those who would have been disappointed , can be happy about it . "
eager to play down the differences within the spd over the controversial capital gains tax , schröder said , " it has to be clear that in the end only that will happen , what the german chancellor and the party chairman believe to be right . "
schröder calls for unity with eye on elections schröder also called upon his party to unite in the face of upcoming elections in the states of lower saxony and hessen on february 2 , 2003 .
" within the party one can discuss heatedly , but one must speak with one voice outside .
it ’ s my duty to make sure that happens , " he said .
with eroding support and a drastic slide in opinion polls showing no signs of easing , the spd is pinning its hopes on the upcoming elections in hessen and lower saxony .

moshe katsav was full of praise for germany , a close ally of his country for decades .
he thanked the german government for its support for israel and for its efforts to combat antisemitism and extremism .
still , katsav described as " terrible " a resurgence of anti-semitism in europe and particularly in germany , where the holocaust had destroyed so many jewish people .
although they were only a small minority , he said , " one never knows how many people will allow themselves to be influenced . "
more military hardware on the cards the issue of the supply of german military hardware to israel dominated talks on monday between katsav and the german chancellor .
after the meeting , schröder announced that his government had not ruled out expanded military support for israel .

over the weekend , katsav did not rule out the possibility that the tanks would be used against " palestinian terrorists " .
the decision whether germany will go ahead with the supply of the tanks still hangs in the balance .
katsav 's failure to deny that they could be used in operations in palestinian areas has worried opponents of the move , especially the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens .
the defence minister peter struck has repeatedly said germany ca n't spare the fuchs tanks .
that assertion will have little bearing on the final ruling by the federal committee on security .
it 's being seen as an attempt to avoid embarrassment should the decision go against israel .

it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .
nagging issue of captial gains tax raises its head again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier of lower saxony sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on tuesday , the spd premier of the state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel -lrb- photo -rrb- reasserted the resolve of spd-ruled states to reintroduce the capital gains tax , which is fiercely opposed by chancellor schröder .
schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .
the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principle that the state must not take more than half of any citizen ’ s income .
gabriel also rejected criticism that the reintroduction of the capital gains tax would scare away investors .
most of the spd-ruled states that are pressing for a reintroduction of the tax argue that it would generate around 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
gabriel announced on tuesday in parliament that he plans to introduce the issue of the 1 percent capital gains tax in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in january .
spd too meek in policy-making ?
gabriel , who faces crucial elections in lower saxony on feb .
2 and has been faring badly in recent opinion polls , called on schröder to show more " courage to take risks " in pushing through reforms in the social and education sector .
taking a dig at chancellor schröder ’ s traditionally close relationship to labor unions , he said that the spd shouldn ’ t " fear demonstrations " and " we shouldn ’ t duck from lobbyists . "
recent days have seen demonstrations and threats of strikes by registered doctors and medical practitioners against the spd ’ s proposed reforms to the health sector .
sceptical voices within the spd gabriel has n't been the only doubting voice within the spd ranks .
schröder ’ s categorical " no " to the introduction of the capital gains tax last week prompted much surprise within his party .
though his opposition to the tax was well known , his pronounced rejection of it ran counter to the spd states ‘ long-planned proposals to reintroduce the tax and took many by surprise .
even the chancellor ’ s outburst on monday during his party meeting , as he engaged in a verbal duel with parliamentary group leader franz müntefering was described by many present as " overbearing and arrogant " .
one party member told the berliner zeitung that the atmosphere at the meeting was " resigned " and that the spd leadership had a " orientation problem " .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship " - schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder on wednesday however schröder showed himself in his usual spirited form and distanced himself from any speculation of his stepping down .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship , " he said .
" all those who had hoped for that , are wrong .
and all those who would have been disappointed , can be happy about it . "
eager to play down the differences within the spd over the controversial capital gains tax , schröder said , " it has to be clear that in the end only that will happen , what the german chancellor and the party chairman believe to be right . "
schröder calls for unity with eye on elections schröder also called upon his party to unite in the face of upcoming elections in the states of lower saxony and hessen on february 2 , 2003 .
" within the party one can discuss heatedly , but one must speak with one voice outside .
it ’ s my duty to make sure that happens , " he said .
with eroding support and a drastic slide in opinion polls showing no signs of easing , the spd is pinning its hopes on the upcoming elections in hessen and lower saxony .
but the outlook for the spd doesn ’ t look bright .
pollsters are predicting that the opposition christian social democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would win both in hessen , a conservative stronghold as well as in lower saxony , a traditional spd-dominated bastion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving till it hurts germany 's complex tax system has long been a bone of contention for individuals and businesses alike .

trade unions are up in arms . good news for ardent shoppers in germany : as early as next month , a new law could be in place enabling shops to open until 8pm on saturdays - four hours more than allowed under present rules . following proposals made by german economics minister wolfgang clement last week , the cabinet on wednesday endorsed the draft law .
chancellor gerhard schröder said he hoped it would boost retail spending .
" the discussion took about three minutes , " he said . "
no one in the cabinet had any difficulty supporting the draft .
we hope that the reticence in retail spending in germany will come to an end , he said . " provided it is passed in parliament , the new law could go into effect as early as january .
under current german law on opening hours which was last reformed in 1956 , retail businesses are only allowed to open until 4pm on saturdays and there is a far-reaching ban on shops opening on sundays and on public holidays . despite massive resistance from trade unions representing the service industry in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder is standing by his minister .
“ the chancellor has said he would welcome shops being able to open until 8pm instead of 4pm in the future , ” a government spokesperson said . both the greens and the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are also for the longer opening hours .
green mp , franziska eichstädt-bohlig proposed that the new law should go further , allowing shops in the center of towns and cities to open until 10pm every day , should they wish . even the oppositon christian democrats along with their fdp coalition partners in saxony anhalt have already proposed that saturday opening hours be extended to 6pm in the state . ‘ not in citizens ’ interest ’ but trade unions are furious about the new plans .
ver.di , the trade union which represents service industry workers in germany maintained in a statement that longer opening hours wouldn ’ t aid economic growth or employment .
the change would result in huge job cuts in the retail sector , as business struggle to reduce their costs in the face of increased competition , they said in the statement . “ it is absurd that the government says they want – on the one hand , to champion unemployment , but on the other hand , with a lengthening of shop opening hours will unleash a process that will destroy thousands of jobs , ” one of the heads of ver.di , franziska wiethold said . ver.di boss , frank bsirske added in a reuters interview that he “ rejected ” the proposed changes , saying they were not “ in citizens ’ interest ” .
ver.di has said if the government is really serious about the changes , then they will have to reckon with huge resistance from the union sector . but whether the new law will actually be successful remains questionable .

the plan was received warmly on all sides , but the clock is ticking .
the southern , greek republic of cyprus is a prime candidate for membership in the european union . should the two sides remain at odds , the divided island does not only have the potential to derail the entire enlargement process , it could spark conflict between greece and turkey .
turkey has said it will annex the northern third of the island , which it invaded in 1974 following a coup attempt by the greek government , should the republic of cyprus become a eu member .
turkey , itself a future eu candidate , is incensed at the prospect of the greek side getting in without the turkish side . greece has threatened to veto the entire enlargement process should the republic of cyprus not make it in .
it has also said that an annexation would seriously escalate the historically tense relationship between greece and turkey . countless top diplomats have sought to solve the cyprus issue in its 28-year history .
the un resolution represents a serious ray of hope .
the greek side , both in nicosia and athens have agreed the plan , which recommends the two sides share ruling duties , provides a good basis for negotiation .
turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash and turkey ’ s new government have given mixed signals , with denktash denying reports that he had accepted the plan .

trade unions are up in arms . good news for ardent shoppers in germany : as early as next month , a new law could be in place enabling shops to open until 8pm on saturdays - four hours more than allowed under present rules . following proposals made by german economics minister wolfgang clement last week , the cabinet on wednesday endorsed the draft law .
chancellor gerhard schröder said he hoped it would boost retail spending .
" the discussion took about three minutes , " he said . "
no one in the cabinet had any difficulty supporting the draft .
we hope that the reticence in retail spending in germany will come to an end , he said . " provided it is passed in parliament , the new law could go into effect as early as january .
under current german law on opening hours which was last reformed in 1956 , retail businesses are only allowed to open until 4pm on saturdays and there is a far-reaching ban on shops opening on sundays and on public holidays . despite massive resistance from trade unions representing the service industry in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder is standing by his minister .
“ the chancellor has said he would welcome shops being able to open until 8pm instead of 4pm in the future , ” a government spokesperson said . both the greens and the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are also for the longer opening hours .
green mp , franziska eichstädt-bohlig proposed that the new law should go further , allowing shops in the center of towns and cities to open until 10pm every day , should they wish . even the oppositon christian democrats along with their fdp coalition partners in saxony anhalt have already proposed that saturday opening hours be extended to 6pm in the state . ‘ not in citizens ’ interest ’ but trade unions are furious about the new plans .
ver.di , the trade union which represents service industry workers in germany maintained in a statement that longer opening hours wouldn ’ t aid economic growth or employment .
the change would result in huge job cuts in the retail sector , as business struggle to reduce their costs in the face of increased competition , they said in the statement . “ it is absurd that the government says they want – on the one hand , to champion unemployment , but on the other hand , with a lengthening of shop opening hours will unleash a process that will destroy thousands of jobs , ” one of the heads of ver.di , franziska wiethold said . ver.di boss , frank bsirske added in a reuters interview that he “ rejected ” the proposed changes , saying they were not “ in citizens ’ interest ” .
ver.di has said if the government is really serious about the changes , then they will have to reckon with huge resistance from the union sector . but whether the new law will actually be successful remains questionable .

it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .
nagging issue of captial gains tax raises its head again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier of lower saxony sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on tuesday , the spd premier of the state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel -lrb- photo -rrb- reasserted the resolve of spd-ruled states to reintroduce the capital gains tax , which is fiercely opposed by chancellor schröder .
schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .
the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principle that the state must not take more than half of any citizen ’ s income .
gabriel also rejected criticism that the reintroduction of the capital gains tax would scare away investors .
most of the spd-ruled states that are pressing for a reintroduction of the tax argue that it would generate around 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
gabriel announced on tuesday in parliament that he plans to introduce the issue of the 1 percent capital gains tax in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in january .
spd too meek in policy-making ?

taking a dig at chancellor schröder ’ s traditionally close relationship to labor unions , he said that the spd shouldn ’ t " fear demonstrations " and " we shouldn ’ t duck from lobbyists . "
recent days have seen demonstrations and threats of strikes by registered doctors and medical practitioners against the spd ’ s proposed reforms to the health sector .
sceptical voices within the spd gabriel has n't been the only doubting voice within the spd ranks .
schröder ’ s categorical " no " to the introduction of the capital gains tax last week prompted much surprise within his party .
though his opposition to the tax was well known , his pronounced rejection of it ran counter to the spd states ‘ long-planned proposals to reintroduce the tax and took many by surprise .
even the chancellor ’ s outburst on monday during his party meeting , as he engaged in a verbal duel with parliamentary group leader franz müntefering was described by many present as " overbearing and arrogant " .

" the chancellor will not leave the ship , " he said .
" all those who had hoped for that , are wrong .
and all those who would have been disappointed , can be happy about it . "
eager to play down the differences within the spd over the controversial capital gains tax , schröder said , " it has to be clear that in the end only that will happen , what the german chancellor and the party chairman believe to be right . "
schröder calls for unity with eye on elections schröder also called upon his party to unite in the face of upcoming elections in the states of lower saxony and hessen on february 2 , 2003 .
" within the party one can discuss heatedly , but one must speak with one voice outside .
it ’ s my duty to make sure that happens , " he said .
with eroding support and a drastic slide in opinion polls showing no signs of easing , the spd is pinning its hopes on the upcoming elections in hessen and lower saxony .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.12.2002 germans to get new saturday shopping hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shop till you drop under the new law the german government plans to rush a new bill through parliament to allow shops to remain open longer on saturdays .
trade unions are up in arms . good news for ardent shoppers in germany : as early as next month , a new law could be in place enabling shops to open until 8pm on saturdays - four hours more than allowed under present rules . following proposals made by german economics minister wolfgang clement last week , the cabinet on wednesday endorsed the draft law .
chancellor gerhard schröder said he hoped it would boost retail spending .
" the discussion took about three minutes , " he said . "
no one in the cabinet had any difficulty supporting the draft .
we hope that the reticence in retail spending in germany will come to an end , he said . " provided it is passed in parliament , the new law could go into effect as early as january .
under current german law on opening hours which was last reformed in 1956 , retail businesses are only allowed to open until 4pm on saturdays and there is a far-reaching ban on shops opening on sundays and on public holidays . despite massive resistance from trade unions representing the service industry in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder is standing by his minister .
“ the chancellor has said he would welcome shops being able to open until 8pm instead of 4pm in the future , ” a government spokesperson said . both the greens and the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are also for the longer opening hours .
green mp , franziska eichstädt-bohlig proposed that the new law should go further , allowing shops in the center of towns and cities to open until 10pm every day , should they wish . even the oppositon christian democrats along with their fdp coalition partners in saxony anhalt have already proposed that saturday opening hours be extended to 6pm in the state . ‘ not in citizens ’ interest ’ but trade unions are furious about the new plans .
ver.di , the trade union which represents service industry workers in germany maintained in a statement that longer opening hours wouldn ’ t aid economic growth or employment .
the change would result in huge job cuts in the retail sector , as business struggle to reduce their costs in the face of increased competition , they said in the statement . “ it is absurd that the government says they want – on the one hand , to champion unemployment , but on the other hand , with a lengthening of shop opening hours will unleash a process that will destroy thousands of jobs , ” one of the heads of ver.di , franziska wiethold said . ver.di boss , frank bsirske added in a reuters interview that he “ rejected ” the proposed changes , saying they were not “ in citizens ’ interest ” .
ver.di has said if the government is really serious about the changes , then they will have to reckon with huge resistance from the union sector . but whether the new law will actually be successful remains questionable .
last time such an initiative was tried , two years ago , it failed to be passed by the bundesrat – the upper house in the german parliamentary system . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no instant cure for germany 's ailing economy 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

trade unions are up in arms . good news for ardent shoppers in germany : as early as next month , a new law could be in place enabling shops to open until 8pm on saturdays - four hours more than allowed under present rules . following proposals made by german economics minister wolfgang clement last week , the cabinet on wednesday endorsed the draft law .
chancellor gerhard schröder said he hoped it would boost retail spending .
" the discussion took about three minutes , " he said . "
no one in the cabinet had any difficulty supporting the draft .
we hope that the reticence in retail spending in germany will come to an end , he said . " provided it is passed in parliament , the new law could go into effect as early as january .
under current german law on opening hours which was last reformed in 1956 , retail businesses are only allowed to open until 4pm on saturdays and there is a far-reaching ban on shops opening on sundays and on public holidays . despite massive resistance from trade unions representing the service industry in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder is standing by his minister .
“ the chancellor has said he would welcome shops being able to open until 8pm instead of 4pm in the future , ” a government spokesperson said . both the greens and the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are also for the longer opening hours .
green mp , franziska eichstädt-bohlig proposed that the new law should go further , allowing shops in the center of towns and cities to open until 10pm every day , should they wish . even the oppositon christian democrats along with their fdp coalition partners in saxony anhalt have already proposed that saturday opening hours be extended to 6pm in the state . ‘ not in citizens ’ interest ’ but trade unions are furious about the new plans .
ver.di , the trade union which represents service industry workers in germany maintained in a statement that longer opening hours wouldn ’ t aid economic growth or employment .
the change would result in huge job cuts in the retail sector , as business struggle to reduce their costs in the face of increased competition , they said in the statement . “ it is absurd that the government says they want – on the one hand , to champion unemployment , but on the other hand , with a lengthening of shop opening hours will unleash a process that will destroy thousands of jobs , ” one of the heads of ver.di , franziska wiethold said . ver.di boss , frank bsirske added in a reuters interview that he “ rejected ” the proposed changes , saying they were not “ in citizens ’ interest ” .

under current german law on opening hours which was last reformed in 1956 , retail businesses are only allowed to open until 4pm on saturdays and there is a far-reaching ban on shops opening on sundays and on public holidays . despite massive resistance from trade unions representing the service industry in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder is standing by his minister .
“ the chancellor has said he would welcome shops being able to open until 8pm instead of 4pm in the future , ” a government spokesperson said . both the greens and the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are also for the longer opening hours .
green mp , franziska eichstädt-bohlig proposed that the new law should go further , allowing shops in the center of towns and cities to open until 10pm every day , should they wish . even the oppositon christian democrats along with their fdp coalition partners in saxony anhalt have already proposed that saturday opening hours be extended to 6pm in the state . ‘ not in citizens ’ interest ’ but trade unions are furious about the new plans .
ver.di , the trade union which represents service industry workers in germany maintained in a statement that longer opening hours wouldn ’ t aid economic growth or employment .
the change would result in huge job cuts in the retail sector , as business struggle to reduce their costs in the face of increased competition , they said in the statement . “ it is absurd that the government says they want – on the one hand , to champion unemployment , but on the other hand , with a lengthening of shop opening hours will unleash a process that will destroy thousands of jobs , ” one of the heads of ver.di , franziska wiethold said . ver.di boss , frank bsirske added in a reuters interview that he “ rejected ” the proposed changes , saying they were not “ in citizens ’ interest ” .
ver.di has said if the government is really serious about the changes , then they will have to reckon with huge resistance from the union sector . but whether the new law will actually be successful remains questionable .

now , the baltic nation is on track for accession to the european union . since emerging from behind the iron curtain in 1990 , latvia has lobbied hard for eu membership . reforming its economy took priority in the mid-1990s , and latvia began boasting sizeable growth rates each year .
the rates hovered around 4 percent and have recently been booming .
a growth rate of more than 7 percent , tops in the baltic states , is expected this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's flag but amid the good news , unemployment remains a major problem .
some eastern regions of the country have rates reaching close to 20 percent , though the country 's average is 7.8 percent , according to latvian economics ministry statistics . the problematic economy was one of the main reasons the european union passed over latvia for its “ first wave ” of membership in 1998 , a major disappointment for many in the government . since then , latvia has dismantled much of its soviet-era planned economic policies and moved its ideology closer to the west .
the country earned high praise for its efforts when it managed to report positive growth rates during the russian economic crisis in the late 1990s . nevertheless , brussels has continued urging more reform , particularly in liberalizing former state-owned companies , and streamlining a large bureaucracy . not all of the eu ’ s suggestions are economic .
latvia ’ s social system is also in need of tweaking . linguistic limbo only a little more than half of the population is actually true-blue latvian .
most of the minority are made up of russian-speakers , caught in linguistic and diplomatic limbo ever since the collapse of the soviet union . the government in riga has recently taken steps to ensure more rights for russian-speakers and better integrate them into society through language programs .
in 1998 , the pro-eu government removed language requirements in the election law , guaranteeing the minority new voting rights . brussels has also praised latvia ’ s commitment to further human rights , such as riga ’ s move to abolish the death penalty in 1999 . last october ’ s elections put a new government in place , spelling the end of prime minister andris berzins term as prime minister .
but as all parties were in favor of both eu and nato accession , the country remained on track . the populace is a little less sure .
concern that nato and eu will be too expensive for the country of 2.4 million is one of the major reasons public opinion of accession in both alliances has rated low .

the plan was received warmly on all sides , but the clock is ticking .
the southern , greek republic of cyprus is a prime candidate for membership in the european union . should the two sides remain at odds , the divided island does not only have the potential to derail the entire enlargement process , it could spark conflict between greece and turkey .
turkey has said it will annex the northern third of the island , which it invaded in 1974 following a coup attempt by the greek government , should the republic of cyprus become a eu member .
turkey , itself a future eu candidate , is incensed at the prospect of the greek side getting in without the turkish side . greece has threatened to veto the entire enlargement process should the republic of cyprus not make it in .
it has also said that an annexation would seriously escalate the historically tense relationship between greece and turkey . countless top diplomats have sought to solve the cyprus issue in its 28-year history .
the un resolution represents a serious ray of hope .
the greek side , both in nicosia and athens have agreed the plan , which recommends the two sides share ruling duties , provides a good basis for negotiation .
turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash and turkey ’ s new government have given mixed signals , with denktash denying reports that he had accepted the plan .

trade unions are up in arms . good news for ardent shoppers in germany : as early as next month , a new law could be in place enabling shops to open until 8pm on saturdays - four hours more than allowed under present rules . following proposals made by german economics minister wolfgang clement last week , the cabinet on wednesday endorsed the draft law .
chancellor gerhard schröder said he hoped it would boost retail spending .
" the discussion took about three minutes , " he said . "
no one in the cabinet had any difficulty supporting the draft .
we hope that the reticence in retail spending in germany will come to an end , he said . " provided it is passed in parliament , the new law could go into effect as early as january .
under current german law on opening hours which was last reformed in 1956 , retail businesses are only allowed to open until 4pm on saturdays and there is a far-reaching ban on shops opening on sundays and on public holidays . despite massive resistance from trade unions representing the service industry in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder is standing by his minister .
“ the chancellor has said he would welcome shops being able to open until 8pm instead of 4pm in the future , ” a government spokesperson said . both the greens and the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are also for the longer opening hours .
green mp , franziska eichstädt-bohlig proposed that the new law should go further , allowing shops in the center of towns and cities to open until 10pm every day , should they wish . even the oppositon christian democrats along with their fdp coalition partners in saxony anhalt have already proposed that saturday opening hours be extended to 6pm in the state . ‘ not in citizens ’ interest ’ but trade unions are furious about the new plans .
ver.di , the trade union which represents service industry workers in germany maintained in a statement that longer opening hours wouldn ’ t aid economic growth or employment .
the change would result in huge job cuts in the retail sector , as business struggle to reduce their costs in the face of increased competition , they said in the statement . “ it is absurd that the government says they want – on the one hand , to champion unemployment , but on the other hand , with a lengthening of shop opening hours will unleash a process that will destroy thousands of jobs , ” one of the heads of ver.di , franziska wiethold said . ver.di boss , frank bsirske added in a reuters interview that he “ rejected ” the proposed changes , saying they were not “ in citizens ’ interest ” .
ver.di has said if the government is really serious about the changes , then they will have to reckon with huge resistance from the union sector . but whether the new law will actually be successful remains questionable .
last time such an initiative was tried , two years ago , it failed to be passed by the bundesrat – the upper house in the german parliamentary system . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no instant cure for germany 's ailing economy 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the cap has failed .
larger farms are paid not to produce , while smaller ones have come to heavily rely on subsidies . reform of the common agricultural policy has become urgent , because the accession of central european countries threatens to break the bank .
farming subsidies in the european union already account for about half of the eu ’ s entire budget – not including the new members .
european farming receives a staggering $ 39 billion a year in direct subsidies - more than the rest of industry combined . franz fischler , the eu 's agriculture minister , outlined proposals for cap reform , according to which farmers would no longer be paid to over-produce .
instead , they would get flat payments , which would be progressively cut back .
the money saved would instead be redirected towards rural development . predictably , the plan met with opposition from the big beneficiaries of the cap : france , spain , greece and ireland .
farm lobbies in those countries fear they would not be able to survive in an unprotected global market .
they have made clear they would fight to prevent a reform that might cost them money . on the other side are countries like germany and the netherlands , which recently argued that if the cap was not reformed before the eu expands eastwards , farm spending would swell by a further $ 20 billion a year in a few years ’ time .
they are determined to keep pressing .
but the other members in favor of reform simply do not have enough votes between them to push it through .
they fear that if they insist now , they may delay the eu 's enlargement . illustration raimo bergt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working out the sticky issues back to the sticky issues dossier ten new countries to join european union back to dw-world 's main dossier 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

1 2001 .
the so-called eurozone is made up of 12 members among the eu 's 15 .
denmark , sweden and britain chose not to join the euro , though are mulling it now .
the 10 new candidates have work in progress to fulfill the strict criteria for joining . on the one hand , the euro is designed to improve business conditions for eu companies , by making cross-border mergers easier to complete , improving price transparency and eliminating exchange-rate risks .
on the other hand , there is a political element : introducing a single currency will also bring about an ever closer union of its members , so the theory goes . euro-zone countries must follow tight and increasingly unpopular common rules , which critics say are stifling growth .
the eu 's stability and growth pact puts a straight jacket on governments by preventing them from raising or lowering interest rates individually , for example , and the european central bank is unlikely to cut interest rates until inflation falls within its target of " less than 2 % " . still , some central european states would like to make the euro their official currency even before they join the union .
while no one can do much to stop them , the european council has given clear guidelines on the procedure for adopting the euro . they are to wait until they have joined the union and then put their national currencies through two years of the exchange-rate mechanism , as well as fulfilling the other criteria , laid out by the treaty of maastricht in 1991 .
low inflation , low public debt and low budget deficits , as well as exchange-rate stability , are the pre-conditions . two candidates , estonia and lithuania , have already tied their national currencies to the euro , but that is about as far as brussels will let these countries go . the new currency has dropped in value since its introduction , due largely to gloom about europe 's economic performance .
as a result , calls are getting louder to reform europe 's framework for operating its single currency . illustration raimo bergt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working out the sticky issues back to the sticky issues page ten new countries to join european union back to dw-world 's main dossier 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

1 2001 .
the so-called eurozone is made up of 12 members among the eu 's 15 .
denmark , sweden and britain chose not to join the euro , though are mulling it now .
the 10 new candidates have work in progress to fulfill the strict criteria for joining . on the one hand , the euro is designed to improve business conditions for eu companies , by making cross-border mergers easier to complete , improving price transparency and eliminating exchange-rate risks .
on the other hand , there is a political element : introducing a single currency will also bring about an ever closer union of its members , so the theory goes . euro-zone countries must follow tight and increasingly unpopular common rules , which critics say are stifling growth .
the eu 's stability and growth pact puts a straight jacket on governments by preventing them from raising or lowering interest rates individually , for example , and the european central bank is unlikely to cut interest rates until inflation falls within its target of " less than 2 % " . still , some central european states would like to make the euro their official currency even before they join the union .
while no one can do much to stop them , the european council has given clear guidelines on the procedure for adopting the euro . they are to wait until they have joined the union and then put their national currencies through two years of the exchange-rate mechanism , as well as fulfilling the other criteria , laid out by the treaty of maastricht in 1991 .
low inflation , low public debt and low budget deficits , as well as exchange-rate stability , are the pre-conditions . two candidates , estonia and lithuania , have already tied their national currencies to the euro , but that is about as far as brussels will let these countries go . the new currency has dropped in value since its introduction , due largely to gloom about europe 's economic performance .
as a result , calls are getting louder to reform europe 's framework for operating its single currency . illustration raimo bergt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working out the sticky issues back to the sticky issues page ten new countries to join european union back to dw-world 's main dossier 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.12.2002 discontent in chancellor schröder 's party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure - german chancellor gerhard schröder an unfortunate remark by the german chancellor has prompted rumors about his resignation and exposed rifts within the social democrats .
it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .
nagging issue of captial gains tax raises its head again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier of lower saxony sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on tuesday , the spd premier of the state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel -lrb- photo -rrb- reasserted the resolve of spd-ruled states to reintroduce the capital gains tax , which is fiercely opposed by chancellor schröder .
schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .
the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principle that the state must not take more than half of any citizen ’ s income .
gabriel also rejected criticism that the reintroduction of the capital gains tax would scare away investors .
most of the spd-ruled states that are pressing for a reintroduction of the tax argue that it would generate around 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
gabriel announced on tuesday in parliament that he plans to introduce the issue of the 1 percent capital gains tax in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in january .
spd too meek in policy-making ?
gabriel , who faces crucial elections in lower saxony on feb .
2 and has been faring badly in recent opinion polls , called on schröder to show more " courage to take risks " in pushing through reforms in the social and education sector .
taking a dig at chancellor schröder ’ s traditionally close relationship to labor unions , he said that the spd shouldn ’ t " fear demonstrations " and " we shouldn ’ t duck from lobbyists . "
recent days have seen demonstrations and threats of strikes by registered doctors and medical practitioners against the spd ’ s proposed reforms to the health sector .
sceptical voices within the spd gabriel has n't been the only doubting voice within the spd ranks .
schröder ’ s categorical " no " to the introduction of the capital gains tax last week prompted much surprise within his party .
though his opposition to the tax was well known , his pronounced rejection of it ran counter to the spd states ‘ long-planned proposals to reintroduce the tax and took many by surprise .
even the chancellor ’ s outburst on monday during his party meeting , as he engaged in a verbal duel with parliamentary group leader franz müntefering was described by many present as " overbearing and arrogant " .
one party member told the berliner zeitung that the atmosphere at the meeting was " resigned " and that the spd leadership had a " orientation problem " .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship " - schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder on wednesday however schröder showed himself in his usual spirited form and distanced himself from any speculation of his stepping down .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship , " he said .
" all those who had hoped for that , are wrong .
and all those who would have been disappointed , can be happy about it . "
eager to play down the differences within the spd over the controversial capital gains tax , schröder said , " it has to be clear that in the end only that will happen , what the german chancellor and the party chairman believe to be right . "
schröder calls for unity with eye on elections schröder also called upon his party to unite in the face of upcoming elections in the states of lower saxony and hessen on february 2 , 2003 .
" within the party one can discuss heatedly , but one must speak with one voice outside .
it ’ s my duty to make sure that happens , " he said .
with eroding support and a drastic slide in opinion polls showing no signs of easing , the spd is pinning its hopes on the upcoming elections in hessen and lower saxony .
but the outlook for the spd doesn ’ t look bright .
pollsters are predicting that the opposition christian social democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would win both in hessen , a conservative stronghold as well as in lower saxony , a traditional spd-dominated bastion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving till it hurts germany 's complex tax system has long been a bone of contention for individuals and businesses alike .

moshe katsav was full of praise for germany , a close ally of his country for decades .
he thanked the german government for its support for israel and for its efforts to combat antisemitism and extremism .
still , katsav described as " terrible " a resurgence of anti-semitism in europe and particularly in germany , where the holocaust had destroyed so many jewish people .
although they were only a small minority , he said , " one never knows how many people will allow themselves to be influenced . "

katsav himself has remained reticent about israel 's wish-list , although he has said he still expects the fuchs armored troop carriers requested by israel to be delivered .
over the weekend , katsav did not rule out the possibility that the tanks would be used against " palestinian terrorists " .
the decision whether germany will go ahead with the supply of the tanks still hangs in the balance .
katsav 's failure to deny that they could be used in operations in palestinian areas has worried opponents of the move , especially the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens .
the defence minister peter struck has repeatedly said germany ca n't spare the fuchs tanks .
that assertion will have little bearing on the final ruling by the federal committee on security .
it 's being seen as an attempt to avoid embarrassment should the decision go against israel .
a symbolic visit though brief , katsav 's visit was heavy with symbolism .

it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .
nagging issue of captial gains tax raises its head again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier of lower saxony sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on tuesday , the spd premier of the state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel -lrb- photo -rrb- reasserted the resolve of spd-ruled states to reintroduce the capital gains tax , which is fiercely opposed by chancellor schröder .
schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .
the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principle that the state must not take more than half of any citizen ’ s income .
gabriel also rejected criticism that the reintroduction of the capital gains tax would scare away investors .
most of the spd-ruled states that are pressing for a reintroduction of the tax argue that it would generate around 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
gabriel announced on tuesday in parliament that he plans to introduce the issue of the 1 percent capital gains tax in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in january .
spd too meek in policy-making ?
gabriel , who faces crucial elections in lower saxony on feb .
2 and has been faring badly in recent opinion polls , called on schröder to show more " courage to take risks " in pushing through reforms in the social and education sector .
taking a dig at chancellor schröder ’ s traditionally close relationship to labor unions , he said that the spd shouldn ’ t " fear demonstrations " and " we shouldn ’ t duck from lobbyists . "
recent days have seen demonstrations and threats of strikes by registered doctors and medical practitioners against the spd ’ s proposed reforms to the health sector .
sceptical voices within the spd gabriel has n't been the only doubting voice within the spd ranks .
schröder ’ s categorical " no " to the introduction of the capital gains tax last week prompted much surprise within his party .
though his opposition to the tax was well known , his pronounced rejection of it ran counter to the spd states ‘ long-planned proposals to reintroduce the tax and took many by surprise .
even the chancellor ’ s outburst on monday during his party meeting , as he engaged in a verbal duel with parliamentary group leader franz müntefering was described by many present as " overbearing and arrogant " .
one party member told the berliner zeitung that the atmosphere at the meeting was " resigned " and that the spd leadership had a " orientation problem " .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship " - schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder on wednesday however schröder showed himself in his usual spirited form and distanced himself from any speculation of his stepping down .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship , " he said .
" all those who had hoped for that , are wrong .
and all those who would have been disappointed , can be happy about it . "
eager to play down the differences within the spd over the controversial capital gains tax , schröder said , " it has to be clear that in the end only that will happen , what the german chancellor and the party chairman believe to be right . "
schröder calls for unity with eye on elections schröder also called upon his party to unite in the face of upcoming elections in the states of lower saxony and hessen on february 2 , 2003 .
" within the party one can discuss heatedly , but one must speak with one voice outside .
it ’ s my duty to make sure that happens , " he said .
with eroding support and a drastic slide in opinion polls showing no signs of easing , the spd is pinning its hopes on the upcoming elections in hessen and lower saxony .
but the outlook for the spd doesn ’ t look bright .

trade unions are up in arms . good news for ardent shoppers in germany : as early as next month , a new law could be in place enabling shops to open until 8pm on saturdays - four hours more than allowed under present rules . following proposals made by german economics minister wolfgang clement last week , the cabinet on wednesday endorsed the draft law .
chancellor gerhard schröder said he hoped it would boost retail spending .
" the discussion took about three minutes , " he said . "
no one in the cabinet had any difficulty supporting the draft .
we hope that the reticence in retail spending in germany will come to an end , he said . " provided it is passed in parliament , the new law could go into effect as early as january .
under current german law on opening hours which was last reformed in 1956 , retail businesses are only allowed to open until 4pm on saturdays and there is a far-reaching ban on shops opening on sundays and on public holidays . despite massive resistance from trade unions representing the service industry in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder is standing by his minister .
“ the chancellor has said he would welcome shops being able to open until 8pm instead of 4pm in the future , ” a government spokesperson said . both the greens and the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are also for the longer opening hours .

ver.di , the trade union which represents service industry workers in germany maintained in a statement that longer opening hours wouldn ’ t aid economic growth or employment .
the change would result in huge job cuts in the retail sector , as business struggle to reduce their costs in the face of increased competition , they said in the statement . “ it is absurd that the government says they want – on the one hand , to champion unemployment , but on the other hand , with a lengthening of shop opening hours will unleash a process that will destroy thousands of jobs , ” one of the heads of ver.di , franziska wiethold said . ver.di boss , frank bsirske added in a reuters interview that he “ rejected ” the proposed changes , saying they were not “ in citizens ’ interest ” .

now , the baltic nation is on track for accession to the european union . since emerging from behind the iron curtain in 1990 , latvia has lobbied hard for eu membership . reforming its economy took priority in the mid-1990s , and latvia began boasting sizeable growth rates each year .
the rates hovered around 4 percent and have recently been booming .
a growth rate of more than 7 percent , tops in the baltic states , is expected this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvia 's flag but amid the good news , unemployment remains a major problem .
some eastern regions of the country have rates reaching close to 20 percent , though the country 's average is 7.8 percent , according to latvian economics ministry statistics . the problematic economy was one of the main reasons the european union passed over latvia for its “ first wave ” of membership in 1998 , a major disappointment for many in the government . since then , latvia has dismantled much of its soviet-era planned economic policies and moved its ideology closer to the west .
the country earned high praise for its efforts when it managed to report positive growth rates during the russian economic crisis in the late 1990s . nevertheless , brussels has continued urging more reform , particularly in liberalizing former state-owned companies , and streamlining a large bureaucracy . not all of the eu ’ s suggestions are economic .
latvia ’ s social system is also in need of tweaking . linguistic limbo only a little more than half of the population is actually true-blue latvian .
most of the minority are made up of russian-speakers , caught in linguistic and diplomatic limbo ever since the collapse of the soviet union . the government in riga has recently taken steps to ensure more rights for russian-speakers and better integrate them into society through language programs .
in 1998 , the pro-eu government removed language requirements in the election law , guaranteeing the minority new voting rights . brussels has also praised latvia ’ s commitment to further human rights , such as riga ’ s move to abolish the death penalty in 1999 . last october ’ s elections put a new government in place , spelling the end of prime minister andris berzins term as prime minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.12.2002 discontent in chancellor schröder 's party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure - german chancellor gerhard schröder an unfortunate remark by the german chancellor has prompted rumors about his resignation and exposed rifts within the social democrats .
it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .
nagging issue of captial gains tax raises its head again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier of lower saxony sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on tuesday , the spd premier of the state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel -lrb- photo -rrb- reasserted the resolve of spd-ruled states to reintroduce the capital gains tax , which is fiercely opposed by chancellor schröder .
schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .
the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principle that the state must not take more than half of any citizen ’ s income .
gabriel also rejected criticism that the reintroduction of the capital gains tax would scare away investors .
most of the spd-ruled states that are pressing for a reintroduction of the tax argue that it would generate around 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
gabriel announced on tuesday in parliament that he plans to introduce the issue of the 1 percent capital gains tax in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in january .
spd too meek in policy-making ?
gabriel , who faces crucial elections in lower saxony on feb .
2 and has been faring badly in recent opinion polls , called on schröder to show more " courage to take risks " in pushing through reforms in the social and education sector .
taking a dig at chancellor schröder ’ s traditionally close relationship to labor unions , he said that the spd shouldn ’ t " fear demonstrations " and " we shouldn ’ t duck from lobbyists . "
recent days have seen demonstrations and threats of strikes by registered doctors and medical practitioners against the spd ’ s proposed reforms to the health sector .
sceptical voices within the spd gabriel has n't been the only doubting voice within the spd ranks .
schröder ’ s categorical " no " to the introduction of the capital gains tax last week prompted much surprise within his party .
though his opposition to the tax was well known , his pronounced rejection of it ran counter to the spd states ‘ long-planned proposals to reintroduce the tax and took many by surprise .
even the chancellor ’ s outburst on monday during his party meeting , as he engaged in a verbal duel with parliamentary group leader franz müntefering was described by many present as " overbearing and arrogant " .
one party member told the berliner zeitung that the atmosphere at the meeting was " resigned " and that the spd leadership had a " orientation problem " .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship " - schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder on wednesday however schröder showed himself in his usual spirited form and distanced himself from any speculation of his stepping down .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship , " he said .
" all those who had hoped for that , are wrong .
and all those who would have been disappointed , can be happy about it . "
eager to play down the differences within the spd over the controversial capital gains tax , schröder said , " it has to be clear that in the end only that will happen , what the german chancellor and the party chairman believe to be right . "
schröder calls for unity with eye on elections schröder also called upon his party to unite in the face of upcoming elections in the states of lower saxony and hessen on february 2 , 2003 .
" within the party one can discuss heatedly , but one must speak with one voice outside .
it ’ s my duty to make sure that happens , " he said .
with eroding support and a drastic slide in opinion polls showing no signs of easing , the spd is pinning its hopes on the upcoming elections in hessen and lower saxony .
but the outlook for the spd doesn ’ t look bright .
pollsters are predicting that the opposition christian social democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would win both in hessen , a conservative stronghold as well as in lower saxony , a traditional spd-dominated bastion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving till it hurts germany 's complex tax system has long been a bone of contention for individuals and businesses alike .

the money saved would instead be redirected towards rural development . predictably , the plan met with opposition from the big beneficiaries of the cap : france , spain , greece and ireland .

larger farms are paid not to produce , while smaller ones have come to heavily rely on subsidies . reform of the common agricultural policy has become urgent , because the accession of central european countries threatens to break the bank .
farming subsidies in the european union already account for about half of the eu ’ s entire budget – not including the new members .
european farming receives a staggering $ 39 billion a year in direct subsidies - more than the rest of industry combined . franz fischler , the eu 's agriculture minister , outlined proposals for cap reform , according to which farmers would no longer be paid to over-produce .
instead , they would get flat payments , which would be progressively cut back .
the money saved would instead be redirected towards rural development . predictably , the plan met with opposition from the big beneficiaries of the cap : france , spain , greece and ireland .
farm lobbies in those countries fear they would not be able to survive in an unprotected global market .
they have made clear they would fight to prevent a reform that might cost them money . on the other side are countries like germany and the netherlands , which recently argued that if the cap was not reformed before the eu expands eastwards , farm spending would swell by a further $ 20 billion a year in a few years ’ time .

now , the baltic nation is on track for accession to the european union . since emerging from behind the iron curtain in 1990 , latvia has lobbied hard for eu membership . reforming its economy took priority in the mid-1990s , and latvia began boasting sizeable growth rates each year .
the rates hovered around 4 percent and have recently been booming .

a lot more than you get out of it , was the message many candidate countries got earlier this year – and they didn ’ t like the news .
poland , the largest eu candidate , has mulled pushing off its planned accession into the eu following reports that the country would pay significantly more into the 98.6 billion euro european union budget in the first few years than it would be getting out of it . at stake is a 40 billion euro aid package available to the new candidate countries from 2004 , when they officially enter , to 2006 .
during those early years , the candidate countries will contribute a total of 15 billion euro into the budget . many of the candidate countries see major flaws in the package , especially in the amount of agricultural subsidies they get . the flaws have contibuted to the sinking popularity for eu entry in relatively well-off countries like slovenia , whose economy is already performing at close to 100 percent the eu average .
many of the candidate countries are worried that they will do better in 2003 , during which they receive aid from the eu for accession , than when they officially join in 2004 . wary of the trend and eager to solve the financial dispute , the current president of the eu , denmark , proposed a sweetened financial package in late november . the new package addresses the agriculture subsidy concern by creating loopholes that would greatly increase the amount of money polish farmers , for example , receive .
under earlier proposals , the new countries would get only 25 percent of the subsidies current member states receive from the 39 billion euro eu agricultural budget .
under the new plan have access to up to 40 percent of the eu average between 2004 and 2006 .

a lot more than you get out of it , was the message many candidate countries got earlier this year – and they didn ’ t like the news .
poland , the largest eu candidate , has mulled pushing off its planned accession into the eu following reports that the country would pay significantly more into the 98.6 billion euro european union budget in the first few years than it would be getting out of it . at stake is a 40 billion euro aid package available to the new candidate countries from 2004 , when they officially enter , to 2006 .
during those early years , the candidate countries will contribute a total of 15 billion euro into the budget . many of the candidate countries see major flaws in the package , especially in the amount of agricultural subsidies they get . the flaws have contibuted to the sinking popularity for eu entry in relatively well-off countries like slovenia , whose economy is already performing at close to 100 percent the eu average .
many of the candidate countries are worried that they will do better in 2003 , during which they receive aid from the eu for accession , than when they officially join in 2004 . wary of the trend and eager to solve the financial dispute , the current president of the eu , denmark , proposed a sweetened financial package in late november . the new package addresses the agriculture subsidy concern by creating loopholes that would greatly increase the amount of money polish farmers , for example , receive .
under earlier proposals , the new countries would get only 25 percent of the subsidies current member states receive from the 39 billion euro eu agricultural budget .
under the new plan have access to up to 40 percent of the eu average between 2004 and 2006 .
candidate countries will also get close to 1 billion euro extra to pay for border control improvements with eastern countries such as russia or the ukraine .

but the cap has failed .
larger farms are paid not to produce , while smaller ones have come to heavily rely on subsidies . reform of the common agricultural policy has become urgent , because the accession of central european countries threatens to break the bank .
farming subsidies in the european union already account for about half of the eu ’ s entire budget – not including the new members .
european farming receives a staggering $ 39 billion a year in direct subsidies - more than the rest of industry combined . franz fischler , the eu 's agriculture minister , outlined proposals for cap reform , according to which farmers would no longer be paid to over-produce .
instead , they would get flat payments , which would be progressively cut back .
the money saved would instead be redirected towards rural development . predictably , the plan met with opposition from the big beneficiaries of the cap : france , spain , greece and ireland .
farm lobbies in those countries fear they would not be able to survive in an unprotected global market .
they have made clear they would fight to prevent a reform that might cost them money . on the other side are countries like germany and the netherlands , which recently argued that if the cap was not reformed before the eu expands eastwards , farm spending would swell by a further $ 20 billion a year in a few years ’ time .
they are determined to keep pressing .
but the other members in favor of reform simply do not have enough votes between them to push it through .
they fear that if they insist now , they may delay the eu 's enlargement . illustration raimo bergt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de working out the sticky issues back to the sticky issues dossier ten new countries to join european union back to dw-world 's main dossier radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

trade unions are up in arms . good news for ardent shoppers in germany : as early as next month , a new law could be in place enabling shops to open until 8pm on saturdays - four hours more than allowed under present rules . following proposals made by german economics minister wolfgang clement last week , the cabinet on wednesday endorsed the draft law .
chancellor gerhard schröder said he hoped it would boost retail spending .
" the discussion took about three minutes , " he said . "
no one in the cabinet had any difficulty supporting the draft .
we hope that the reticence in retail spending in germany will come to an end , he said . " provided it is passed in parliament , the new law could go into effect as early as january .
under current german law on opening hours which was last reformed in 1956 , retail businesses are only allowed to open until 4pm on saturdays and there is a far-reaching ban on shops opening on sundays and on public holidays . despite massive resistance from trade unions representing the service industry in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder is standing by his minister .
“ the chancellor has said he would welcome shops being able to open until 8pm instead of 4pm in the future , ” a government spokesperson said . both the greens and the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are also for the longer opening hours .
green mp , franziska eichstädt-bohlig proposed that the new law should go further , allowing shops in the center of towns and cities to open until 10pm every day , should they wish . even the oppositon christian democrats along with their fdp coalition partners in saxony anhalt have already proposed that saturday opening hours be extended to 6pm in the state . ‘ not in citizens ’ interest ’ but trade unions are furious about the new plans .
ver.di , the trade union which represents service industry workers in germany maintained in a statement that longer opening hours wouldn ’ t aid economic growth or employment .
the change would result in huge job cuts in the retail sector , as business struggle to reduce their costs in the face of increased competition , they said in the statement . “ it is absurd that the government says they want – on the one hand , to champion unemployment , but on the other hand , with a lengthening of shop opening hours will unleash a process that will destroy thousands of jobs , ” one of the heads of ver.di , franziska wiethold said . ver.di boss , frank bsirske added in a reuters interview that he “ rejected ” the proposed changes , saying they were not “ in citizens ’ interest ” .
ver.di has said if the government is really serious about the changes , then they will have to reckon with huge resistance from the union sector . but whether the new law will actually be successful remains questionable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.12.2002 discontent in chancellor schröder 's party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure - german chancellor gerhard schröder an unfortunate remark by the german chancellor has prompted rumors about his resignation and exposed rifts within the social democrats .
it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .
nagging issue of captial gains tax raises its head again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier of lower saxony sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on tuesday , the spd premier of the state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel -lrb- photo -rrb- reasserted the resolve of spd-ruled states to reintroduce the capital gains tax , which is fiercely opposed by chancellor schröder .
schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .
the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principle that the state must not take more than half of any citizen ’ s income .
gabriel also rejected criticism that the reintroduction of the capital gains tax would scare away investors .
most of the spd-ruled states that are pressing for a reintroduction of the tax argue that it would generate around 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
gabriel announced on tuesday in parliament that he plans to introduce the issue of the 1 percent capital gains tax in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in january .
spd too meek in policy-making ?
gabriel , who faces crucial elections in lower saxony on feb .
2 and has been faring badly in recent opinion polls , called on schröder to show more " courage to take risks " in pushing through reforms in the social and education sector .
taking a dig at chancellor schröder ’ s traditionally close relationship to labor unions , he said that the spd shouldn ’ t " fear demonstrations " and " we shouldn ’ t duck from lobbyists . "
recent days have seen demonstrations and threats of strikes by registered doctors and medical practitioners against the spd ’ s proposed reforms to the health sector .
sceptical voices within the spd gabriel has n't been the only doubting voice within the spd ranks .
schröder ’ s categorical " no " to the introduction of the capital gains tax last week prompted much surprise within his party .
though his opposition to the tax was well known , his pronounced rejection of it ran counter to the spd states ‘ long-planned proposals to reintroduce the tax and took many by surprise .
even the chancellor ’ s outburst on monday during his party meeting , as he engaged in a verbal duel with parliamentary group leader franz müntefering was described by many present as " overbearing and arrogant " .
one party member told the berliner zeitung that the atmosphere at the meeting was " resigned " and that the spd leadership had a " orientation problem " .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship " - schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder on wednesday however schröder showed himself in his usual spirited form and distanced himself from any speculation of his stepping down .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship , " he said .
" all those who had hoped for that , are wrong .
and all those who would have been disappointed , can be happy about it . "
eager to play down the differences within the spd over the controversial capital gains tax , schröder said , " it has to be clear that in the end only that will happen , what the german chancellor and the party chairman believe to be right . "
schröder calls for unity with eye on elections schröder also called upon his party to unite in the face of upcoming elections in the states of lower saxony and hessen on february 2 , 2003 .
" within the party one can discuss heatedly , but one must speak with one voice outside .
it ’ s my duty to make sure that happens , " he said .
with eroding support and a drastic slide in opinion polls showing no signs of easing , the spd is pinning its hopes on the upcoming elections in hessen and lower saxony .
but the outlook for the spd doesn ’ t look bright .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.12.2002 germans to get new saturday shopping hours großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shop till you drop under the new law the german government plans to rush a new bill through parliament to allow shops to remain open longer on saturdays .
trade unions are up in arms . good news for ardent shoppers in germany : as early as next month , a new law could be in place enabling shops to open until 8pm on saturdays - four hours more than allowed under present rules . following proposals made by german economics minister wolfgang clement last week , the cabinet on wednesday endorsed the draft law .
chancellor gerhard schröder said he hoped it would boost retail spending .
" the discussion took about three minutes , " he said . "
no one in the cabinet had any difficulty supporting the draft .
we hope that the reticence in retail spending in germany will come to an end , he said . " provided it is passed in parliament , the new law could go into effect as early as january .
under current german law on opening hours which was last reformed in 1956 , retail businesses are only allowed to open until 4pm on saturdays and there is a far-reaching ban on shops opening on sundays and on public holidays . despite massive resistance from trade unions representing the service industry in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder is standing by his minister .
“ the chancellor has said he would welcome shops being able to open until 8pm instead of 4pm in the future , ” a government spokesperson said . both the greens and the pro-business liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are also for the longer opening hours .
green mp , franziska eichstädt-bohlig proposed that the new law should go further , allowing shops in the center of towns and cities to open until 10pm every day , should they wish . even the oppositon christian democrats along with their fdp coalition partners in saxony anhalt have already proposed that saturday opening hours be extended to 6pm in the state . ‘ not in citizens ’ interest ’ but trade unions are furious about the new plans .
ver.di , the trade union which represents service industry workers in germany maintained in a statement that longer opening hours wouldn ’ t aid economic growth or employment .

it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .
nagging issue of captial gains tax raises its head again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier of lower saxony sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on tuesday , the spd premier of the state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel -lrb- photo -rrb- reasserted the resolve of spd-ruled states to reintroduce the capital gains tax , which is fiercely opposed by chancellor schröder .
schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .
the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principle that the state must not take more than half of any citizen ’ s income .
gabriel also rejected criticism that the reintroduction of the capital gains tax would scare away investors .
most of the spd-ruled states that are pressing for a reintroduction of the tax argue that it would generate around 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
gabriel announced on tuesday in parliament that he plans to introduce the issue of the 1 percent capital gains tax in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in january .
spd too meek in policy-making ?
gabriel , who faces crucial elections in lower saxony on feb .
2 and has been faring badly in recent opinion polls , called on schröder to show more " courage to take risks " in pushing through reforms in the social and education sector .
taking a dig at chancellor schröder ’ s traditionally close relationship to labor unions , he said that the spd shouldn ’ t " fear demonstrations " and " we shouldn ’ t duck from lobbyists . "
recent days have seen demonstrations and threats of strikes by registered doctors and medical practitioners against the spd ’ s proposed reforms to the health sector .
sceptical voices within the spd gabriel has n't been the only doubting voice within the spd ranks .
schröder ’ s categorical " no " to the introduction of the capital gains tax last week prompted much surprise within his party .
though his opposition to the tax was well known , his pronounced rejection of it ran counter to the spd states ‘ long-planned proposals to reintroduce the tax and took many by surprise .
even the chancellor ’ s outburst on monday during his party meeting , as he engaged in a verbal duel with parliamentary group leader franz müntefering was described by many present as " overbearing and arrogant " .
one party member told the berliner zeitung that the atmosphere at the meeting was " resigned " and that the spd leadership had a " orientation problem " .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship " - schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder on wednesday however schröder showed himself in his usual spirited form and distanced himself from any speculation of his stepping down .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship , " he said .
" all those who had hoped for that , are wrong .
and all those who would have been disappointed , can be happy about it . "
eager to play down the differences within the spd over the controversial capital gains tax , schröder said , " it has to be clear that in the end only that will happen , what the german chancellor and the party chairman believe to be right . "
schröder calls for unity with eye on elections schröder also called upon his party to unite in the face of upcoming elections in the states of lower saxony and hessen on february 2 , 2003 .
" within the party one can discuss heatedly , but one must speak with one voice outside .
it ’ s my duty to make sure that happens , " he said .
with eroding support and a drastic slide in opinion polls showing no signs of easing , the spd is pinning its hopes on the upcoming elections in hessen and lower saxony .
but the outlook for the spd doesn ’ t look bright .
pollsters are predicting that the opposition christian social democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would win both in hessen , a conservative stronghold as well as in lower saxony , a traditional spd-dominated bastion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving till it hurts germany 's complex tax system has long been a bone of contention for individuals and businesses alike .

most of the spd-ruled states that are pressing for a reintroduction of the tax argue that it would generate around 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
gabriel announced on tuesday in parliament that he plans to introduce the issue of the 1 percent capital gains tax in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in january .
spd too meek in policy-making ?
gabriel , who faces crucial elections in lower saxony on feb .

taking a dig at chancellor schröder ’ s traditionally close relationship to labor unions , he said that the spd shouldn ’ t " fear demonstrations " and " we shouldn ’ t duck from lobbyists . "
recent days have seen demonstrations and threats of strikes by registered doctors and medical practitioners against the spd ’ s proposed reforms to the health sector .
sceptical voices within the spd gabriel has n't been the only doubting voice within the spd ranks .
schröder ’ s categorical " no " to the introduction of the capital gains tax last week prompted much surprise within his party .
though his opposition to the tax was well known , his pronounced rejection of it ran counter to the spd states ‘ long-planned proposals to reintroduce the tax and took many by surprise .
even the chancellor ’ s outburst on monday during his party meeting , as he engaged in a verbal duel with parliamentary group leader franz müntefering was described by many present as " overbearing and arrogant " .

" the chancellor will not leave the ship , " he said .
" all those who had hoped for that , are wrong .
and all those who would have been disappointed , can be happy about it . "
eager to play down the differences within the spd over the controversial capital gains tax , schröder said , " it has to be clear that in the end only that will happen , what the german chancellor and the party chairman believe to be right . "
schröder calls for unity with eye on elections schröder also called upon his party to unite in the face of upcoming elections in the states of lower saxony and hessen on february 2 , 2003 .
" within the party one can discuss heatedly , but one must speak with one voice outside .
it ’ s my duty to make sure that happens , " he said .
with eroding support and a drastic slide in opinion polls showing no signs of easing , the spd is pinning its hopes on the upcoming elections in hessen and lower saxony .

it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .

schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .

it ‘ s bad news for a party that faces crucial regional elections in february . embattled german chancellor gerhard schröder finds himself in the thick of another controversial debate , this time one prompted unwitting by himself .
during a heated debate at a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in berlin on monday , schröder is reported to have said , " anyone who believes they can do it -lrb- govern -rrb- better , should do it . "
the moment the damning words escaped the chancellor ’ s lips , some top party members interpreted it as an indirect threat by the chancellor to step down .
the media has been quick to seize upon it and the country ’ s papers and news programs have been dominated by frenzied speculation about whether germany ’ s recently re-elected chancellor has finally lost his nerve and decided to throw in the towel .
though the spd public relations machinery is now in overdrive - denying the chancellor ’ s threat to resign and protesting that he has been grossly misinterpreted - there is little doubt that the chancellor ’ s provocative statement has drawn attention to the unhappiness and divisions that have erupted in the top echelons of his party over further tax hikes and policy issues .
nagging issue of captial gains tax raises its head again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : premier of lower saxony sigmar gabriel -lrb- spd -rrb- on tuesday , the spd premier of the state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel -lrb- photo -rrb- reasserted the resolve of spd-ruled states to reintroduce the capital gains tax , which is fiercely opposed by chancellor schröder .
schröder , who has come under fire for reneging on electoral promises and introducing a rash of tax hikes , has refused to re-introduce the controversial tax .
the tax foresees a 1 percent tax levied on companies whose assets exceed 2.5 million euro and on individuals who own more than 1 million euro in property , cash and investments .
the tax was ruled unconstitutional and abolished in 1997 because it ran against the principle that the state must not take more than half of any citizen ’ s income .
gabriel also rejected criticism that the reintroduction of the capital gains tax would scare away investors .
most of the spd-ruled states that are pressing for a reintroduction of the tax argue that it would generate around 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.8 billion -rrb- in annual revenues .
gabriel announced on tuesday in parliament that he plans to introduce the issue of the 1 percent capital gains tax in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in january .
spd too meek in policy-making ?
gabriel , who faces crucial elections in lower saxony on feb .
2 and has been faring badly in recent opinion polls , called on schröder to show more " courage to take risks " in pushing through reforms in the social and education sector .
taking a dig at chancellor schröder ’ s traditionally close relationship to labor unions , he said that the spd shouldn ’ t " fear demonstrations " and " we shouldn ’ t duck from lobbyists . "
recent days have seen demonstrations and threats of strikes by registered doctors and medical practitioners against the spd ’ s proposed reforms to the health sector .
sceptical voices within the spd gabriel has n't been the only doubting voice within the spd ranks .
schröder ’ s categorical " no " to the introduction of the capital gains tax last week prompted much surprise within his party .
though his opposition to the tax was well known , his pronounced rejection of it ran counter to the spd states ‘ long-planned proposals to reintroduce the tax and took many by surprise .
even the chancellor ’ s outburst on monday during his party meeting , as he engaged in a verbal duel with parliamentary group leader franz müntefering was described by many present as " overbearing and arrogant " .
one party member told the berliner zeitung that the atmosphere at the meeting was " resigned " and that the spd leadership had a " orientation problem " .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship " - schröder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder on wednesday however schröder showed himself in his usual spirited form and distanced himself from any speculation of his stepping down .
" the chancellor will not leave the ship , " he said .
" all those who had hoped for that , are wrong .
and all those who would have been disappointed , can be happy about it . "
eager to play down the differences within the spd over the controversial capital gains tax , schröder said , " it has to be clear that in the end only that will happen , what the german chancellor and the party chairman believe to be right . "
schröder calls for unity with eye on elections schröder also called upon his party to unite in the face of upcoming elections in the states of lower saxony and hessen on february 2 , 2003 .
" within the party one can discuss heatedly , but one must speak with one voice outside .
it ’ s my duty to make sure that happens , " he said .
with eroding support and a drastic slide in opinion polls showing no signs of easing , the spd is pinning its hopes on the upcoming elections in hessen and lower saxony .
but the outlook for the spd doesn ’ t look bright .
pollsters are predicting that the opposition christian social democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- would win both in hessen , a conservative stronghold as well as in lower saxony , a traditional spd-dominated bastion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving till it hurts germany 's complex tax system has long been a bone of contention for individuals and businesses alike .

moshe katsav was full of praise for germany , a close ally of his country for decades .
he thanked the german government for its support for israel and for its efforts to combat antisemitism and extremism .
still , katsav described as " terrible " a resurgence of anti-semitism in europe and particularly in germany , where the holocaust had destroyed so many jewish people .
although they were only a small minority , he said , " one never knows how many people will allow themselves to be influenced . "
more military hardware on the cards the issue of the supply of german military hardware to israel dominated talks on monday between katsav and the german chancellor .
after the meeting , schröder announced that his government had not ruled out expanded military support for israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handout-foto zeigt den deutschen spuerpanzer " fuchs " .
der einsatz deutscher spuerpanzer im irakischen grenzgebiet ist nicht ausgeschlossen , sagte der stellvertretende vorsitzende des auswaertigen ausschusses im bundestag , hans-ullrich klose , der ' bild ' -zeitung vom samstag , 23.nov.
2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / ho -rrb- schröder reiterated germany 's willingness to supply israel with us-built patriot missiles , and said " other assistance " had also been discussed , but he was tight-lipped about the details of any further military aid .
katsav himself has remained reticent about israel 's wish-list , although he has said he still expects the fuchs armored troop carriers requested by israel to be delivered .
over the weekend , katsav did not rule out the possibility that the tanks would be used against " palestinian terrorists " .
the decision whether germany will go ahead with the supply of the tanks still hangs in the balance .
katsav 's failure to deny that they could be used in operations in palestinian areas has worried opponents of the move , especially the government 's junior coalition partner , the greens .
the defence minister peter struck has repeatedly said germany ca n't spare the fuchs tanks .
that assertion will have little bearing on the final ruling by the federal committee on security .
it 's being seen as an attempt to avoid embarrassment should the decision go against israel .
a symbolic visit though brief , katsav 's visit was heavy with symbolism .
on sunday he became the first israeli president to consecrate a german synagogue in a ceremony in wuppertal described by the german chancellor gerhard schröder , as " moving " .

-lrb- ap photo / str -rrb- katsav 's official duties also included a visit to a former concentration camp at sachsenhausen outside berlin , and a speech before berlin 's jewish community , in which he stressed israel 's right to defend itself against palestinian terrorism .
demonstrations " a disgrace " german neo-nazis marching through berlin on monday failed to cast a shadow over the israeli president 's visit .
about 100 supporters of the far-right npd demonstrated , holding up banners saying " hands off palestine – no german weapons for israel " .
several hundred anti-nazi demonstrators were also gathered along the protest route , kept apart from the right-wingers by a police cordon .
germany 's foreign minister joschka fischer described the demonstrations as " a disgrace " .

the cutty sark was put in a dry dock in greenwich 50 years ago after having sailed the world for nearly a century .

in its heyday the clipper was famous for recording the fastest voyage time from australia to britain .
foreign sale richard doughty , chief executive of the cutty sark trust , said : " we need to raise a minimum of £ 8m for the preservation work or we will have to put her up for sale - probably to a foreigner .
" it would be a shame to lose her , but if we ca n't raise the money we need we may have to sell her and see her taken abroad . "
the cutty sark , which was originally designed to last just 30 years , has a wrought iron frame clad in timber .
it is thought the vessel is being badly affected by rust .

the cutty sark was put in a dry dock in greenwich 50 years ago after having sailed the world for nearly a century .
but now the trust that manages the tourist attraction says it needs a minimum of £ 8m to stop it from rotting away .
in its heyday the clipper was famous for recording the fastest voyage time from australia to britain .
foreign sale richard doughty , chief executive of the cutty sark trust , said : " we need to raise a minimum of £ 8m for the preservation work or we will have to put her up for sale - probably to a foreigner .
" it would be a shame to lose her , but if we ca n't raise the money we need we may have to sell her and see her taken abroad . "
the cutty sark , which was originally designed to last just 30 years , has a wrought iron frame clad in timber .
it is thought the vessel is being badly affected by rust .
the trust , formed to preserve the ship which was launched in 1869 , is putting in a bid for money from the heritage lottery fund in december 2003 .
a decision is not expected until mid-2004 .

"
thousands of employers continue to maintain high-quality pension schemes , but there is a real danger that , as the cost of provision rises , the level of provision will fall " christine farnish , napf chief executive the national association of pension funds said a total of 84 final salary schemes were closed to new members in 2002 , up from 46 last year .
the figures spell more bad news for british workers , who have seen the value of their retirement savings fall steeply in recent years because of a slump on the stock market and a tougher economic environment .
final salary schemes , which guarantee a pension equivalent to a fixed proportion of workers ' final wages , provide a more generous retirement income than alternative defined contribution schemes , which are tied to stock market performance .
shortfall most of the companies to have closed their final salary schemes have done so because diminishing returns on stock market investments have made it too expensive to top up their pension funds to the required level .
the bulk of those companies are offering their employees defined contribution schemes instead .
the latest napf report highlights the gap between the two types of savings plan , with employer payments to defined contribution schemes coming in at 6 % of salary this year , compared with 12 % for final salary schemes .
the report also suggests that the trend towards final salary scheme closures could continue , with 95 % of firms saying their pension schemes had become more expensive to maintain than five years ago .
age gap many employers expect the retirement age to be raised from 65 to 70 by 2030 .
however , the survey showed that about 24 % of firms polled had taken contributions holidays in 2002 , in a sign that many occupational pension schemes are well-funded .

the first craft was due to be delivered to the raf this week - 16 years after designers first started work .
but the crashing of the da6 craft in spain in november has prompted fresh concerns at the ministry of defence about the eurofighter 's design .
the project affects 16,000 jobs in the uk and is regarded by analysts as crucial to the aerospace industry .
the industry is desperate for a major contract - we can not afford not to have the eurofighter dennis mendoros , north west aerospace alliance the eurofighter typhoon will be assembled at bae systems plants in warton and samlesbury , lancashire , and also affects smaller firms contracted to work on the project .
but the first craft is now only expected to be delivered to the raf by june 2003 at the earliest .
unions have told the bbc they are worried more delays on the project could result in job losses .
the mod is understood to have concerns about a number of design issues , data on flight safety and performance and has said it can not rule out more delays .
dennis mendoros , of the north west aerospace alliance which represents smaller manufacturers , said the industry needed the project to succeed .
eurofighter will be assembled at bae systems in warton he said : " undoubtedly the economy of the north west would be the major beneficiary of this project .
" the industry is desperate for a major contract - we can not afford not to have the eurofighter . "
michael jack mp -lrb- con -rrb- , whose fylde constituency is home to many bae systems workers , said the delay was regrettable but understandable .
he added : " i think it 's always worrying when a fighter plane does n't stick to its agreed timetable for its in-service date .
" but it 's a complex project and , given what happened to one of the project 's prototypes crashing in spain , i think the message is better safe than sorry . "
the current delay is the latest in a long series of setbacks to the project since designers first began work .

turmoil in the travel industry has taken its toll on the british tour operator first choice .
the company said profits before tax and financial charges for the year to late september were £ 79.6m -lrb- $ 50m -rrb- , down 8.9 % compared with the previous year .
the firm said the decline reflected deteriorating market conditions , describing the past year as one of the " toughest and most challenging " the travel industry had ever faced .
however , the company said forward bookings for winter and summer breaks next year had improved .
first choice chief executive peter long added that the firm had maintained its profit margins by cutting costs .
city investors reacted cautiously , bidding first choice shares up 3.5p to 102p in early trade .
tourism woes the global travel industry has been hit hard by a fall-off in lucrative long-haul holidays since the 11 september attacks , with many holidaymakers opting for short city breaks instead .
first choice said recent market conditions had been the most challenging since the 1991 gulf war .
recent casualties have included first choice 's closest competitor mytravel , which lost more than half its market value in october after warning that weak sales and accounting problems would dent profits .
there has been speculation that first choice could try to buy out its enfeebled rival .
a takeover attempt would turn the tables on mytravel , formerly known as airtours , which tried to buy first choice three years ago .
that bid was blocked on competition grounds by the european commission , but the european union 's highest court has since ruled that the deal would not have breached eu competition rules after all .

yvonne watts , 72 , has been told she will have to wait at least a year for a hip operation despite being in constant pain and having to use a wheelchair .
she is suffering , she is in pain everyday julie harding but in what would be the first legal case of its kind , she is challenging that decision using new eu regulations .
under an eu justice ruling last year , people have the right to seek treatment in other eu countries if they are facing an undue delay .
mrs watts ' lawyers are arguing one year is an undue delay , and that she is therefore entitled to go abroad for treatment .
however , bedford primary care trust says one year does not count as an undue delay under department of health guidelines .
french hospital the reality is that people are not able to receive surgery within weeks of presenting themselves to either a gp or a consultant margaret stockham mrs watts ' daughter julie harding has spoken to a consultant at la louviere hospital in lille , france , who has confirmed the operation can be done within two weeks .
mrs harding says she will travel with her mother to see the consultant in january regardless of whether they are given the go-ahead from the local trust .
if necessary , she says she will re-mortgage her house to pay for the treatment privately .
the cost of treatment in france is estimated at around £ 4,000 - no more than it would cost on the nhs .
mrs harding said her mother had lost her independence as a result of her condition .
" she is suffering , she is in pain everyday .
it is a struggle to get up , it is a struggle to have a wash in the morning , it is a struggle to get up and down the stairs .
" i can not bear to see her in pain to next october . "
why wait ?
last year 1,100 nhs patients were sent abroad for treatment under the new rules .
richard stein , the lawyer handling the case , said : " the basis of the european union is to provide an equality of service across member states .
" we should all be asking the question why , if in france you have a hip that needs replacing you can have it done next week , should people in this country have to wait a year ?
" there is excess capacity there , and it must be right that people in this country should not have to put up with intolerable delays . "
margaret stockham , chief executive of bedford primary care trust , told the bbc that the trust was sticking to its position that mrs watts did not qualify for foreign treatment because she had been told she would not have to wait for more than a year for an operation on the nhs .
mrs watts had been categorised as a routine , rather than an urgent patient .
she said : " we have made a decision based on the rules and regulations of this country , and with advice from the department of health .
" we have sympathy for mrs watts and every patient that has to wait for surgery , but the reality is that people are not able to receive surgery within weeks of presenting themselves to either a gp or a consultant .
" therefore there has to be some orderly system of making sure that patents are treated in turn and in appropriate priority order . "
a health department spokeswoman said the department could not comment on individual cases but the time a patient spent on a waiting list depended on the priority allocated to them by doctors .
she said : " the maximum time that a patient should wait for inpatient treatment is currently 15 months - in line with the nhs plan .
" however , from april next year this will be reduced to 12 months .

two years ago , business for taybeh beer was booming .
nadim employed 12 people , turning out up to 4,000 bottles of beer per hour from his family-owned plant near ramallah .
the khourys returned to the hilltop village of taybeh after 20 years in boston and invested $ 1.2m in the business following the signing of the oslo accords in 1993 .
but now , with production down 90 % , his revenues barely cover the phone bill .
disruption checkpoints and curfews seriously hamper deliveries while supplies of key imports - british yeast , belgian malt , german hops and portuguese bottles - are at the mercy of the israeli authorities . "
the conflict in israel / palestine at the moment is affecting everyone and affecting every place " amir orly , israeli tour guide " they hold our shipment just to give us a hard time , to check if these are not weapons , to check them for security check-ups , " explains mr khoury .
" they even take a sample of the bottles .
they inspect them and they bring them back and charge us every time for security check ups , for opening these containers . "
on a recent $ 20,000 consignment of imported bottles , taybeh beer was charged $ 6,000 in costs for hold-ups at the israeli port .
the authorities said these delays could be avoided if mr khoury bought his bottles from israeli firms .
shunned by tourists the 26-month-long israeli-palestinian conflict is taking its toll on businesses on both sides of the divide .
the tourism industry in particular has collapsed .
with regular army incursions into bethlehem , the cradle of christianity is best visited wearing a flak jacket while the threat of palestinian suicide bombers in israeli towns has scared away all but the most die-hard pilgrims .
up on jerusalem 's mount of olives , overlooking the old city with its golden dome , israeli tour guide amir orly is almost unemployed .
once , there would be hundreds of tourists from all over the world milling around - now , it is usually deserted .
" the conflict in israel / palestine at the moment is affecting everyone and affecting every place , " says an exasperated mr orly .
" tourism has slowed down tremendously to a point that as you can see now this is pretty much dead . "
losing out israel 's tourism industry here once attracted $ 4bn annually in foreign currency .
it represented 9 % of gross domestic product and employed 100,000 people directly .
but since the september 2000 intifada , the number of foreign tourists has dropped 65 % .
" we 're talking about a loss of $ 2.1bn alone in the year 2001 in expected foreign currency that did n't arrive into the country , " says oren drori of israel 's tourism ministry .
" some 30,000 people have lost their jobs ... so the impact needless to say is great on the israeli economy . "
wider problems leading economist yoram gabbay , head of peilim portfolio management company , says the fallout from the conflict is affecting all sectors , from hi-tech to the high street .
many small businesses are now surviving on their savings .
another year of the intifada could see off more than a quarter of these enterprises .
for the israeli economy , this would add to today 's 10.6 % unemployed - putting even more strain on the overstretched budget .
palestinian companies , aware of israel 's economic woes , accuse israel of trying to alleviate some of its troubles by mounting a trade war on the back of its military clampdown .
' taking advantage ' action and inaction by israel 's customs and its army are squeezing once profitable businesses such as taybeh beer - which are unable to maintain supplies to customers .
palestinian businesspeople say israeli companies are taking advantage of the tense security situation and moving in on their competitors ' markets .
however , israel 's foreign ministry is adamant that there is no hidden agenda to advance its companies ' interests nor to destroy the palestinian economy .
the official line is : if attacks on israelis end , there would be no need for the tight security - and normal economic life can return .
expansion blocked this is little consolation to palestinian mobile phone operator jawwal .
israel impounded $ 4m worth of towers and transmitters at tel aviv airport 13 months ago - in the name of security .
as a result , jawwal can not expand its customer base and has trouble maintaining the quality of its existing service .
its management is battling to maintain market share in the face of competition from israeli operators .
these companies , with masts erected in neighbouring west bank settlements , offer pre-paid services in palestinian towns - even though they have no palestinian licence .
no licence " they believe that they can market , sell , promote , cover and go about their business without paying for a licence , without paying value added taxes - and this to them , it 's the national expansion , " complains jawwal 's chief executive hakam kanafani .
" in israel there are five and a half million people carrying mobile phones out of six million .
the market there is completely saturated . "
israel 's leading operator cellcom refused to respond to this allegation .
the company would only confirm that it serves israeli settlers and the military in the west bank .
mobile phone agents in palestinian towns such as ramallah and hebron clearly display the cellcom logo .
drying up back at taybeh - the word means " delicious " in arabic - nadim khoury explains that when he ca n't get his beer to his customers , they have to turn to israeli and european brands .
his back is against the wall .
while the palestinian intifada continues , so will the israeli military crackdown - and both economies are suffering the consequences .
but palestinian companies are being hit the hardest , leaving what 's left of their markets in the sights of israeli firms .

two years ago , business for taybeh beer was booming .
nadim employed 12 people , turning out up to 4,000 bottles of beer per hour from his family-owned plant near ramallah .
the khourys returned to the hilltop village of taybeh after 20 years in boston and invested $ 1.2m in the business following the signing of the oslo accords in 1993 .
but now , with production down 90 % , his revenues barely cover the phone bill .
disruption checkpoints and curfews seriously hamper deliveries while supplies of key imports - british yeast , belgian malt , german hops and portuguese bottles - are at the mercy of the israeli authorities .
the conflict in israel / palestine at the moment is affecting everyone and affecting every place amir orly , israeli tour guide " they hold our shipment just to give us a hard time , to check if these are not weapons , to check them for security check-ups , " explains mr khoury .
" they even take a sample of the bottles .
they inspect them and they bring them back and charge us every time for security check ups , for opening these containers . "
on a recent $ 20,000 consignment of imported bottles , taybeh beer was charged $ 6,000 in costs for hold-ups at the israeli port .
the authorities said these delays could be avoided if mr khoury bought his bottles from israeli firms .
shunned by tourists the 26-month-long israeli-palestinian conflict is taking its toll on businesses on both sides of the divide .
the tourism industry in particular has collapsed .
tourism numbers have dropped off sharply with regular army incursions into bethlehem , the cradle of christianity is best visited wearing a flak jacket while the threat of palestinian suicide bombers in israeli towns has scared away all but the most die-hard pilgrims .
up on jerusalem 's mount of olives , overlooking the old city with its golden dome , israeli tour guide amir orly is almost unemployed .
once , there would be hundreds of tourists from all over the world milling around - now , it is usually deserted .
" the conflict in israel / palestine at the moment is affecting everyone and affecting every place , " says an exasperated mr orly .
" tourism has slowed down tremendously to a point that as you can see now this is pretty much dead . "
losing out israel 's tourism industry here once attracted $ 4bn annually in foreign currency .
oren drori : many thousands have lost their jobs it represented 9 % of gross domestic product and employed 100,000 people directly .
but since the september 2000 intifada , the number of foreign tourists has dropped 65 % .
" we 're talking about a loss of $ 2.1bn alone in the year 2001 in expected foreign currency that did n't arrive into the country , " says oren drori of israel 's tourism ministry .
" some 30,000 people have lost their jobs ... so the impact needless to say is great on the israeli economy . "
wider problems leading economist yoram gabbay , head of peilim portfolio management company , says the fallout from the conflict is affecting all sectors , from hi-tech to the high street .
many small businesses are now surviving on their savings .
another year of the intifada could see off more than a quarter of these enterprises .
for the israeli economy , this would add to today 's 10.6 % unemployed - putting even more strain on the overstretched budget .
palestinian companies , aware of israel 's economic woes , accuse israel of trying to alleviate some of its troubles by mounting a trade war on the back of its military clampdown .
' taking advantage ' action and inaction by israel 's customs and its army are squeezing once profitable businesses such as taybeh beer - which are unable to maintain supplies to customers .
palestinian businesspeople say israeli companies are taking advantage of the tense security situation and moving in on their competitors ' markets .
however , israel 's foreign ministry is adamant that there is no hidden agenda to advance its companies ' interests nor to destroy the palestinian economy .
the official line is : if attacks on israelis end , there would be no need for the tight security - and normal economic life can return .
expansion blocked this is little consolation to palestinian mobile phone operator jawwal .
israel impounded $ 4m worth of towers and transmitters at tel aviv airport 13 months ago - in the name of security .
hakam kanafani : claims israeli operators are competing unfairly as a result , jawwal can not expand its customer base and has trouble maintaining the quality of its existing service .
its management is battling to maintain market share in the face of competition from israeli operators .
these companies , with masts erected in neighbouring west bank settlements , offer pre-paid services in palestinian towns - even though they have no palestinian licence .
no licence " they believe that they can market , sell , promote , cover and go about their business without paying for a licence , without paying value added taxes - and this to them , it 's the national expansion , " complains jawwal 's chief executive hakam kanafani .
" in israel there are five and a half million people carrying mobile phones out of six million .
the market there is completely saturated . "
israel 's leading operator cellcom refused to respond to this allegation .
the company would only confirm that it serves israeli settlers and the military in the west bank .
mobile phone agents in palestinian towns such as ramallah and hebron clearly display the cellcom logo .
drying up back at taybeh - the word means " delicious " in arabic - nadim khoury explains that when he ca n't get his beer to his customers , they have to turn to israeli and european brands .
his back is against the wall .
while the palestinian intifada continues , so will the israeli military crackdown - and both economies are suffering the consequences .
but palestinian companies are being hit the hardest , leaving what 's left of their markets in the sights of israeli firms .
nadim , incidentally , means " bringer of drink " in arabic .
he would , if only he could .

the whale and dolphin conservation society -lrb- wdcs -rrb- says too many of the mammals are being washed up dead on the region 's beaches .
it has carried out a survey of dolphins and says there are more of the mammals moving into local waters .
but hundreds of dolphins have been found dead on the beaches of cornwall and devon and neighbouring french coasts during recent winters .
dolphins are killed in their hundreds these stranded bodies are just a fraction of the thousands of dolphins feared to be dying in the nets of trawlers that fish in the area at this time of year .
mark simmonds , science director of the wdcs , said : " the survey is an important step towards understanding these animals in order to protect them effectively .
" little is known about small cetacean species in uk waters .
" the survey aimed to increase knowledge about the ecology , habitat preference and distribution of these animals . "
the call follows a survey carried out by the wdcs and greenpeace in october and november this year .
the groups , operating on board the greenpeace flagship rainbow warrior , surveyed the coasts of wales and then south and south-west england .
calves sighted more than 400 animals were sighted .
bottlenose dolphins were seen in cardigan bay on numerous occasions and risso 's dolphins in the northern part of the bay .
in total four cetacean species were definitively identified - bottlenose , common and risso 's dolphins and harbour porpoises .
the northern part of cardigan bay and the pembrokeshire coastline proved to be especially important for this species , with numerous sightings of juveniles and calves .
the results of the survey will be analysed over the winter and will provide information that will help to inform the development of protected areas for dolphins .

this new instalment takes over from where the fellowship of the ring left off .
there is no explanatory preamble .
it is assumed that the audience knows the plot .
the picture , which runs for three hours , just one minute longer than the first episode of tolkien 's trilogy , delivers an epic action-adventure that flows from a challenging narrative .
with the fellowship splintered , three distinct storylines emerge .
the hobbit frodo baggins with companion sam and a computer-generated gollum trek on to mordor to destroy the one ring .
hobbits merry and pippin are trying to engage a forest of trees against the evil forces of saruman .
meanwhile , most dramatically , aragorn and other characters are engaged in the battle at helm 's deep .
this battle is the film 's centrepiece and it is masterfully executed .
computer graphics have been put to use to bring to life a formidable army of 10,000 beast-like creatures .
awe-inspiring under the command of saruman it is trying to storm the fortress at helm 's deep .
it is here that a wobbly king of rohan , played nicely by well cast rings newcomer bernard hill , is trying to protect his people .
he is helped by the brave warrior aragorn , a character who emerges as a real hero in this episode , with a performance from viggo mortensen which earns him definite leading man credentials .
with the action at helm 's deep , director peter jackson and his team have created horrifying awe-inspiring battle sequences .
this film is infused with a definite sense of foreboding with humankind under the threat of genocide and evil about to engulf all of middle-earth .
the story in this latest addition is darker , but more accessible and engaging than in the first film because in most cases the distinctions between good and evil are more sharply defined .
that is not quite the case with the heroic hobbit frodo , who in the face of the corrupting power of the ring is seen to vacillate and almost lose faith .
but his loyal companion sam comes to his aid and in what is one of the more emotionally satisfying moments demonstrates his faithfulness as a true friend .
struggle gollum , who was seen fleetingly in the first film but now emerges as the two towers computer-graphics star , is guiding both frodo and sam to mordor .
he has a wonderfully raspy voice supplied with great expertise by british actor andy serkis .
physically he is hard to describe .
he has big bulging eyes and resembles a giant foetus sporting a wardrobe that only includes a loincloth .
the ring has also corrupted gollum and we witness his internal struggle as he shifts between his good and bad side .
some fans might regard him as the new jar jar binks , the irritating and jarring computer-generated character that emerged in star wars three years ago .
but gollum , a key character in the lord of the rings story , also fits seamlessly into this adaptation , very much a tribute to serkis and the sensitivities of the artists who created him .
another computer-generated character , treebeard , complements gollum .
otherwise it is the human actors who dominate .
emotion the australian actress miranda otto gives an assured debut in the series as eowyn , the strong-willed niece of the king of rohan .
the wizard gandalf returns as gandalf the white with just the right touch of majesty from ian mckellen , and john rhys-davies injects a lot of humour as the dwarf gimli .
the emotional struggles of all the characters in the two towers are more keenly felt than in the first picture .
the only exception is the romance between aragorn and the elf arwen played by liv tyler , which comes over as slightly cool .
the influences of the new zealand locations , jackson 's upbringing there , the diverse cast and tolkien have all been combined to create an epic fantasy and action film that is truly refreshing .
the two towers bears some resemblance to other cinematic epic series such as star wars and indiana jones , but it seems free of a hollywood sensibility .
this second episode is truly engaging and rewarding .
it may be 179 minutes long but it is a film that never lets the audience down , it touches you emotionally and it makes you think .
the two towers is released on 18 december .

this new instalment takes over from where the fellowship of the ring left off .
there is no explanatory preamble .
it is assumed that the audience knows the plot .
the picture , which runs for three hours , just one minute longer than the first episode of tolkien 's trilogy , delivers an epic action-adventure that flows from a challenging narrative .
with the fellowship splintered , three distinct storylines emerge .
the hobbit frodo baggins with companion sam and a computer-generated gollum trek on to mordor to destroy the one ring .
hobbits merry and pippin are trying to engage a forest of trees against the evil forces of saruman .
meanwhile , most dramatically , aragorn and other characters are engaged in the battle at helm 's deep .
the friendship between sam and frodo strengthens this battle is the film 's centrepiece and it is masterfully executed .
computer graphics have been put to use to bring to life a formidable army of 10,000 beast-like creatures .
awe-inspiring under the command of saruman it is trying to storm the fortress at helm 's deep .
it is here that a wobbly king of rohan , played nicely by well cast rings newcomer bernard hill , is trying to protect his people .
he is helped by the brave warrior aragorn , a character who emerges as a real hero in this episode , with a performance from viggo mortensen which earns him definite leading man credentials .
with the action at helm 's deep , director peter jackson and his team have created horrifying awe-inspiring battle sequences .
this film is infused with a definite sense of foreboding with humankind under the threat of genocide and evil about to engulf all of middle-earth .
viggo mortensen as hero warrior aragorn plays a greater part the story in this latest addition is darker , but more accessible and engaging than in the first film because in most cases the distinctions between good and evil are more sharply defined .
that is not quite the case with the heroic hobbit frodo , who in the face of the corrupting power of the ring is seen to vacillate and almost lose faith .
but his loyal companion sam comes to his aid and in what is one of the more emotionally satisfying moments demonstrates his faithfulness as a true friend .
struggle gollum , who was seen fleetingly in the first film but now emerges as the two towers computer-graphics star , is guiding both frodo and sam to mordor .
he has a wonderfully raspy voice supplied with great expertise by british actor andy serkis .
physically he is hard to describe .
he has big bulging eyes and resembles a giant foetus sporting a wardrobe that only includes a loincloth .
the ring has also corrupted gollum and we witness his internal struggle as he shifts between his good and bad side .
some fans might regard him as the new jar jar binks , the irritating and jarring computer-generated character that emerged in star wars three years ago .
miranda otto makes a strong first appearance as eowyn but gollum , a key character in the lord of the rings story , also fits seamlessly into this adaptation , very much a tribute to serkis and the sensitivities of the artists who created him .
another computer-generated character , treebeard , complements gollum .
otherwise it is the human actors who dominate .
emotion the australian actress miranda otto gives an assured debut in the series as eowyn , the strong-willed niece of the king of rohan .
the wizard gandalf returns as gandalf the white with just the right touch of majesty from ian mckellen , and john rhys-davies injects a lot of humour as the dwarf gimli .
the emotional struggles of all the characters in the two towers are more keenly felt than in the first picture .
the only exception is the romance between aragorn and the elf arwen played by liv tyler , which comes over as slightly cool .
the influences of the new zealand locations , jackson 's upbringing there , the diverse cast and tolkien have all been combined to create an epic fantasy and action film that is truly refreshing .
the two towers bears some resemblance to other cinematic epic series such as star wars and indiana jones , but it seems free of a hollywood sensibility .
this second episode is truly engaging and rewarding .
it may be 179 minutes long but it is a film that never lets the audience down , it touches you emotionally and it makes you think .
the two towers is released on 18 december .

the 195-77 vote was non-binding , but prime minister jean chretien had already signalled his intention to ratify the agreement by the end of the year if it was approved by parliament .
it 's really excellent , a good indication of the wishes of the country and the canadian people environment minister david anderson the vote came despite opposition from several of canada 's more powerful provinces , who fear the treaty could harm the country 's economy - and followed days of delay tactics by the official opposition party , the canadian alliance .
canada 's decision is in stark contrast to the position of the neighbouring united states , where president george w bush has rejected the accord .
fierce opposition prime minister chretien and his governing liberals have been determined to push through canada 's ratification of kyoto for some time , says a bbc correspondent in toronto .
" it 's really excellent , a good indication of the wishes of the country and the canadian people , " said environment minister david anderson .
jean chretien is retiring in just over a year but the canadian alliance blasted the ratification plan as " a gross mistake for canada " .
the plan to ratify the accord has become the largest strain on canadian national unity since quebec came close to voting for secession in 1995 , our correspondent says .
the premier of oil-rich alberta , ralph klein , has opposed kyoto at every turn and even funded television advertisements to convince albertans that the treaty 's implementation would cost jobs .
but mr chretien remained defiant .
he is retiring in just over a year , and critics say he can afford to make a grand gesture in an effort to enhance his legacy .
high energy use the kyoto protocol obliges canada to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 6 % from 1990 levels by 2012 .
opinion polls show that canadians are more concerned about global warming than their neighbours in the us .
but paradoxically the two nations have a similar penchant for petrol-guzzling vehicles and other wasteful forms of energy consumption .
canada remains a huge consumer of energy - and if no action is taken , canadian emissions by 2010 are predicted to be 33 % above 1990 levels .
critics say that habits must change if the country has any hope of living up to its kyoto commitments .
