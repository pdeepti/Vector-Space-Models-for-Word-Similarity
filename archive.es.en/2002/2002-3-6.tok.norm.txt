the public and commercial services union analysed government figures on pay in the civil service and found it was failing to tackle huge inequality .
about half the uk 's 500,000 civil servants are women , but the union found their pay is on average 28 % lower than men 's .
women are paid an average 19 % less than men women were also twice as likely to be low earners , on less than £ 15,000 a year , the union said .
pat campbell , the union 's head of equalities , said civil service departments should carry out equality audits to identify unfair differences in pay .
a spokesman for the tuc said : " this is the government 's opportunity to lead from the front and show companies that the voluntary approach can work . "
a spokesman for trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said the minister took the issue of equal pay very seriously .
ms hewitt had written to government departments asking them to carry out a pay audit within the next year and to prepare an action plan to close any pay gaps , the spokesman said .
audit request shock at the same time , private sector firms have been accused of being complacent about women 's pay .
the uk 's second biggest union , amicus , said it was " shocking " that most companies refused to review their wage rates despite an average pay gap of 19 % .
the union , formed from a merger between the msf and the aeeu , wrote to more than 6,000 employers at the end of last year asking them to carry out pay audits .
it said only 50 companies agreed to the request , with 99 % refusing to do so , or failing to respond .
the union now plans to hold special conferences around the country offering to help women take tribunal cases against any employers who pay them less than men .
the union said compulsory audits should be introduced to help achieve equal pay rates .
an official at the dti said the results of the amicus research had to be questioned because it was not known how many of the companies surveyed recognised the union .

people who eat breakfast may be better equipped to fight off colds and flu , says a scientist .
mothers have always described it as " the most important meal of the day " , but in modern society , many people are more inclined to skip breakfast .
however , research at the school of psychology at cardiff university suggests that the convenience may not pay off - particularly in the winter flu season .
professor andy smith recruited 188 volunteers , who each kept a diary over 10 weeks of their eating habits .
these were contrasted with how many infections such as colds and flu the volunteer remembered having over the period .
the research found that those who developed more than one illness over the 10 weeks were less likely to be breakfasters .
this group had also suffered more " negative life events " , such as job stress or bereavement , in the past 12 months .
stressful lives a separate study looked at 498 healthy students who were asked to come to see him if they developed any sort of upper respiratory tract infection - such as a cold .
the 188 who did so were more likely to be smokers - or reported themselves as having " stressful " lives .
" the body produces millions of white blood cells - and it 's an army that needs feeding .
professor ron eccles , common cold centre , cardiff professor smith said : " these studies have provided evidence of the effects of upper respiratory tract infections on mood and performance .
" they have shown that psychosocial factors and health related behaviours may well influence susceptability to colds and flu and the nature and extent of the symptoms . "
the reasons why breakfast might be a protective factor are not entirely clear .
immune food professor ron eccles , from the common cold centre - also at cardiff university - said that the most likely explanation was the effect of an early morning feed on the body 's immune system .
he said : " the body produces millions of white blood cells - and it 's an army that needs feeding .
" however , people missing breakfast may be those who have a lot of stress in their lives , so it may be this which makes infection more likely . "
another finding of the study was that people who had multiple illnesses were less likely to drink alcohol .
professor eccles said that small amounts of alcohol could well have a relaxant effect , which might allow the immune system to function more effectively .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- landlords suffer as london rent tumbles categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 6 march , 2002 , 08:06 gmt landlords suffer as london rent tumbles london : many foreign tenants have returned home london landlords are being hit by falling demand in corporate lettings .
corporate lets account for 30 % of the london market , but the impact of 11 september and the weaker financial markets has seen the demand for rented property dwindle .
this has fed through to the residential sector , putting pressure on rents across london .
" there is not much profit for landlords in the lettings market at the moment , " said jeremy leaf from the royal institution of chartered surveyors .
yields for landlords in the residential lettings sector fell for the fifth consecutive quarter , an rics survey said .
gone home " the trouble is people are still being laid off in the financial services sector , so it is difficult to see who is going to take up the slack in demand after many overseas tenants went home after 11 september , " said sabina kalyan , property analyst with consultants capital economics .
but regional demand - where corporate lets only account for between 6 % and 12 % of the overall market - is holding up better .
tenant demand , especially for unfurnished property , has held rents steady across most of the country .
and the rics survey predicts that the london market should pick up in the months ahead as oversupply eases .
house price boom despite the surplus of rented property , house prices are still growing strongly .
last week , mortgage lender nationwide said that uk house prices grew strongly in february , and may beat growth expectations in the year ahead .
average house prices grew by 1.6 % in february compared to the previous month , and by 14 % on the year , the company said in its closely-watched monthly property market survey .
the average uk house now costs £ 94,965 .
the latest figures suggest that the uk residential property market , which has soared by an estimated 75 % during the past ten years , shows no sign of flattening despite a year of below-trend economic growth and widespread uncertainty over prospects for 2002 .
halifax will on thursday release its house prices survey for february .
