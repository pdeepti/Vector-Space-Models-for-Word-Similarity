eu external affairs commissioner chris patten said in an interview with britain 's guardian newspaper that european governments should speak up before the us went into " unilateralist overdrive " .
even if you 're the greatest superpower in the world , you can not do it all on your own chris patten mr patten said president bush 's characterisation of iran , iraq and north korea as an " axis of evil " was " unhelpful " , adding , " i find it hard to believe that 's a thought-through policy " .
he said the european policy of " constructive dialogue " with iran was more likely to bring results than an american approach which consisted of " more rhetoric than substance " .
there has been a recent revival of relations between iran and the west , with the eu hoping that by engaging with iran , it can encourage the reformers in the iranian government and improve human rights .

mr patten criticised the united states for focusing more on wiping out terrorism than trying to eradicate its causes .

relations have been warming between the eu and iran " we have realised that we have to tackle ' the root causes of terrorism and violence ' , he said , adding that " smart bombs have their place but smart development assistance seems to me even more significant , " he said .

the rail , maritime and transport -lrb- rmt -rrb- union decided on friday evening to suspend its plans for industrial action .
further talks with the management of south west trains , which serves the south and south-west of england , are due next week .
commuters using the network were facing major disruption from monday , in the pay dispute .
this is a positive message and now it 's time to go forward vernon hince , rmt speaking after the announcement vernon hince , acting general secretary of the rmt , said further industrial action was still a " possibility " .

" i would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every member of staff who rallied round during this action and our passengers for their forbearance . "

on one occasion as many as half a million people crowded into independence avenue and the surrounding streets .
it is easy to be blown away by the numbers , and forget incumbent president didier ratsiraka , who they are literally falling over each other to demonstrate against .
however many opposition supporters march through the streets and go out on general strike , the presidential election is still a two-horse race , and at last the press had a chance to see the president in action and to hear his point of view .
the call came to the hotel at 0200 and by 1000 the international media were flying over the beautiful monsoon-season green landscape of the malagasy countryside in one of the president 's helicopters .
the destination was a village on the east coast of the island , a small gathering of huts and clearings in the lagoon land .
reaching rural voters it was a well chosen site for the president to show that his rival marc ravalomanana is not the only one who can rustle up t-shirt wearing supporters , seemingly happy to hand him their vote .
while the capital has been the core of the opposition 's ballot box success story , rural madagascar , where most people live , is a lot more difficult to work out , simply because it is so isolated - even more so in the rainy season .
more than 1,000 people crowded around the clearing in nosy varika as the helicopters bearing the president and the media came in to land .
most people wore red headbands - the president 's colour .
others were sporting banners and flags .
didier ratsiraka took to the hastily-erected stage .
a length of rope was quickly added to help the tarpaulin roof stay put , and after several abortive efforts with the sound system , one of the faithful was dispatched to jam a screwdriver into the speaker wiring to make sure everyone in the crowd could hear .
by this stage it was n't especially necessary , as the numbers had dropped to around 500 .
cash handouts those who left may well have regretted it , as the " father of the nation " put his hands in his pockets and started giving out money .
it is not the hardest or most subtle way of winning people 's support .
but after a few embarrassing attempts to start rallying chants that left row upon row of puzzled and quiet faces , millions of malagasy francs were handed out in thick wads to war veterans , elders and students who could answer one of the president 's quiz questions .
millions of francs may sound a lot , and in fact the money was worth about $ 4,000 - a vast amount in a poor rural community .
the flags were waved with a little more vigour and a quick bridge-opening ceremony was hijacked by the cameras and the reporters scrambling for the president 's first wise words for a month or so .
they were not disappointed .
whether in english , french or malagasy , the message was the same : " look at how much support i have here .
" the second round of elections is on - and i 'm going to win .
and if anyone cheated in the first round it was the opposition . "
voters split the area was once close to his heartland , but despite reports of opposition supporters throwing stones at ratsiraka campaigners and causing violence in the villages , there is now a split .
as many as half say they are voting for change - perhaps even more .
it is no longer as simple as town and country .
the questions followed the president onto the plane , where he had to go to sleep to avoid the inquisitive voices .
it was an awkward media event .
carefully staged , but clumsily executed , you could n't help asking that if this was the best president ratsiraka could come up with , he does not appear to pose much of a threat in the second round .
as the press were emptied out at the airport to find their own way back to wherever they came from - when many taxis are on strike and the airport 's closed - the thoughts were much the same - apprehension .
the one thing that did come out of the president 's little photo opportunity was that he is not a man who seems prepared to give ground - he wants to keep his presidency and win the second ballot .
the opposition might question just how far he might be prepared to go in order to achieve that goal .

the call came to the hotel at 0200 and by 1000 the international media were flying over the beautiful monsoon-season green landscape of the malagasy countryside in one of the president 's helicopters .
the destination was a village on the east coast of the island , a small gathering of huts and clearings in the lagoon land .
reaching rural voters it was a well chosen site for the president to show that his rival marc ravalomanana is not the only one who can rustle up t-shirt wearing supporters , seemingly happy to hand him their vote .
ratsiraka is wooing rural voters with cash while the capital has been the core of the opposition 's ballot box success story , rural madagascar , where most people live , is a lot more difficult to work out , simply because it is so isolated - even more so in the rainy season .
more than 1,000 people crowded around the clearing in nosy varika as the helicopters bearing the president and the media came in to land .
most people wore red headbands - the president 's colour .
others were sporting banners and flags .
didier ratsiraka took to the hastily-erected stage .
a length of rope was quickly added to help the tarpaulin roof stay put , and after several abortive efforts with the sound system , one of the faithful was dispatched to jam a screwdriver into the speaker wiring to make sure everyone in the crowd could hear .
by this stage it was n't especially necessary , as the numbers had dropped to around 500 .
cash handouts those who left may well have regretted it , as the " father of the nation " put his hands in his pockets and started giving out money .
it is not the hardest or most subtle way of winning people 's support .
but after a few embarrassing attempts to start rallying chants that left row upon row of puzzled and quiet faces , millions of malagasy francs were handed out in thick wads to war veterans , elders and students who could answer one of the president 's quiz questions .
the opposition protests have brought the capital to a standstill millions of francs may sound a lot , and in fact the money was worth about $ 4,000 - a vast amount in a poor rural community .
the flags were waved with a little more vigour and a quick bridge-opening ceremony was hijacked by the cameras and the reporters scrambling for the president 's first wise words for a month or so .
they were not disappointed .
whether in english , french or malagasy , the message was the same : " look at how much support i have here .
" the second round of elections is on - and i 'm going to win .
and if anyone cheated in the first round it was the opposition . "
voters split the area was once close to his heartland , but despite reports of opposition supporters throwing stones at ratsiraka campaigners and causing violence in the villages , there is now a split .
as many as half say they are voting for change - perhaps even more .
it is no longer as simple as town and country .
the questions followed the president onto the plane , where he had to go to sleep to avoid the inquisitive voices .
it was an awkward media event .
carefully staged , but clumsily executed , you could n't help asking that if this was the best president ratsiraka could come up with , he does not appear to pose much of a threat in the second round .
as the press were emptied out at the airport to find their own way back to wherever they came from - when many taxis are on strike and the airport 's closed - the thoughts were much the same - apprehension .
the one thing that did come out of the president 's little photo opportunity was that he is not a man who seems prepared to give ground - he wants to keep his presidency and win the second ballot .
the opposition might question just how far he might be prepared to go in order to achieve that goal . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's alistair leithead " this is a man who is determined he 's going to win " divided island key stories chance for change humanitarian crisis illegal fuel trail ethnic strife q & a : political turmoil profiles marc ravalomanana didier ratsiraka background biodiversity threat country profile timeline see also : 08 feb 02 -pipe- africa madagascar president breaks silence 06 feb 02 -pipe- africa army warning for madagascar strikers internet links : marc ravalomanana 's website madagascar government facts cia world factbook - madagascar madagascar us embassy the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top africa stories now : huge challenge for african union kenya hit by malaria epidemic new hope for aids vaccine winnie mandela faces fraud trial ratsiraka moots madagascar return nigerian woman fights stoning opposition attacks ivory coast poll african union replaces dictators ' club links to more africa stories are at the foot of the page .

bbc news -pipe- oscars 2002 -pipe- critics ' beautiful debate categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : in depth : oscars 2002 front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 9 february , 2002 , 08:21 gmt critics ' beautiful debate crowe 's performance has won acclaim by entertainment correspondent tom brook in new york a beautiful mind , director ron howard 's portrayal of mathematics genius john nash jr and his battle with schizophrenia , continues to fuel a vigorous debate in the us over the veracity of its storytelling .
the film , which stars russell crowe as john nash and jennifer connelly as his wife alicia , is expected to garner several academy award nominations , and many consider it a possible frontrunner in the oscars best picture race .
howard 's film portrays nash as an intellectually brilliant man , who succumbed to schizophrenia for many years and then finally triumphed over his illness , winning a nobel prize in 1994 .
this interpretation is wrong , according to new york-based film critic charles taylor .
the film is loosely based on a biography of the same age he claims nash admitted he never made a total recovery from his illness and hollywood is trying to turn his life story into an unconditional triumph .
taylor , who reviews films for salon.com , says : " it 's been conceived as something to make audiences weep and to win oscars . "
' love conquers all ' the new york times critic who praised certain aspects of a beautiful mind also found that the story was " almost entirely counterfeit . "
other reviewers complained nash 's recovery from schizophrenia was presented too much in terms of a " love conquers all " narrative .
in defending their picture , the film-makers insist a beautiful mind is not a biography , but a human drama " inspired " by events in john nash 's life .
jennifer connelly plays alicia nash director ron howard says : " it is very true in terms of his life .
it 's not his complete life .
" all the scenes are not the absolute words that john nash said , but then again , the sweep of his life , the architecture of his life , is very true to what he and his wife alicia have dealt with . "
but critics say it airbrushes away certain uncomfortable realities .
nash and his wife divorced , before remarrying last year , but this is never mentioned in the film .
neither is the fact that he nash fathered a child with another woman and then reportedly abandoned them both .
also nash was arrested in the 1950 's for soliciting sex in a men 's public lavatory , and also had a number of apparently sexual liaisons with men , but these details too have been omitted .
' not relevant ' screenwriter akiva goldsman maintains all these aspects of nash 's life were left out because they just were n't relevant to the basic thrust of the screenplay .
goldsman says , " john did or did n't have sexual relationships with men .
according to john , he did n't .
crowe won a golden globe for his role " but in any case , it was n't what the story was about .
john also had a wife , a long relationship with another woman and another son .
all these incidents occurred outside the context of the story that we 're telling .
" our story is about one abiding relationship - john and alicia - and the way that relationship carried him through his journey to healing . "
syliva nasar , who wrote the biography on which the film is partly based , thinks much of the criticism misses the point .
she believes the picture presents a valuable and realistic portrait of schizophrenia that is rarely seen .
nasar says : " this is the first time someone with this illness not only survives it , and triumphs over it but is seen as a fully multi-dimensional human being who 's loved .
that 's amazing .
" i think anyone who knows , either through personal experience or otherwise , about this illness that is what 's amazing about the movie . "
nasar does not stand alone in this assessment because many mental health professionals have confirmed the film gives a very accurate portrayal of a person suffering from paranoid schizophrenia .
but critic charles taylor says that alone " does n't make it a good movie " .
" movies are not public service announcements .
if you 're saying ' i 'm going to go and present a positive image of mental illness , ' you 're really in the advertising business , " he says .
defending the film : producer brian grazer and ron howard ' jeopardy ' in previous years similar films which have had the veracity of their storytelling challenged have found the negative criticism jeopardised their oscar chances .
but this seems unlikely to happen with a beautiful mind .
john nash has seen the film and , according to his biographer , really likes it .
the picture also has many admirers who believe the essential truth of nash 's story has been preserved .
russell crowe and jennifer connelly 's acting has been widely praised and won significant pre-oscar awards .
akiva goldsman 's ingenious screenplay has its fans , as well as detractors .
finally , everyone seems to think that ron howard 's time has come .
the oscars ceremony will be broadcast live on bbc two on monday 25 march from 0045-0600 gmt and reported live on bbc news online .
