15 , germany 's national railway will introduce a new pricing system .
deutsche bahn claims its new fares will make travel cheaper , but a prominent consumer organization says that 's not the case . in a report released this week , consumer group stiftung warentest , which is germany 's answer to " consumer reports , " gave the new pricing system mixed reviews , saying deutsche bahn failed to deliver the savings it promised .
warentest workers compared a total of 1,600 fares from the new system with the lowest-possible fares available under the current system .
the organization found that , for many , bahn 's new system will result in higher fares .
deutsche bahn 's new price structure is modeled after the airlines , which offer travelers considerable savings if they book early .
bahn hopes the system will enable it to better plan its revenues , meet demand and fill trains .
the biggest losers : families in its statements about the system , deutsche bahn has said that families will be the biggest winners under the new fares , but stiftung warentest 's researchers countered the claim .
warentest found that prices will actually rise for families with older children .
currently , families can purchase a " family bahncard , " entitling every member of a family up to the age of 27- to a 50-percent discount on rail travel within germany .
however , the new system lowers the age limit to 17 .
deutsche bahn is also eliminating the ice family saver ticket , which offers a considerable discount on germany 's high-speed trains to families traveling together .
expensive changes the price changes will also make train fares higher for single travelers , especially on short journeys .
with the current bahncard , holders receive a 50-percent discount on all trains - both regional and intercity .
under the new system , however , bahncard holders only receive a 25-percent discount - unless they book well in advance .
additionally , stiftung warentest criticized deutsche bahn for applying excessive new regulations for discounts and special offers and implementing exorbitant fees for making ticket changes .
for example , travelers who take a train other than the one they have reserved will be subjected to a ticket-change fee running as high as 45 euros -lrb- $ 44.80 -rrb- in each direction .
winners but stiftung warentest did manage to find praise for at least a few aspects of the new pricing structure .
for example , small groups of up to five people traveling together can take advantage of both group discounts and an early booking discount .
the result is fares that can run 20-40 percent lower than current group ticket prices .
warentest also praised savings for families traveling with children between the ages of six and 14 , who can now travel more cheaply .
the organization said deutsche bahn had made a wise choice in the new structure by allowing passengers to combine any available discounts together - be it through a bahncard , a special offer or group travel .
stung by the overall poor marks from stiftung warentest , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn said the criticism was unwarranted .
he accused the consumer organization of issuing an unbalanced report .
mehdorn said stiftung warentest researchers pulled out just a few fares that were designed to give a distorted and negative image of the national railway .
mehdorn is also standing behind the company 's statements that train travel will be cheaper for millions of people under the new pricing system and not just a few bargain hunters .

15 , germany 's national railway will introduce a new pricing system .
deutsche bahn claims its new fares will make travel cheaper , but a prominent consumer organization says that 's not the case . in a report released this week , consumer group stiftung warentest , which is germany 's answer to " consumer reports , " gave the new pricing system mixed reviews , saying deutsche bahn failed to deliver the savings it promised .
warentest workers compared a total of 1,600 fares from the new system with the lowest-possible fares available under the current system .
the organization found that , for many , bahn 's new system will result in higher fares .
deutsche bahn 's new price structure is modeled after the airlines , which offer travelers considerable savings if they book early .
bahn hopes the system will enable it to better plan its revenues , meet demand and fill trains .
the biggest losers : families in its statements about the system , deutsche bahn has said that families will be the biggest winners under the new fares , but stiftung warentest 's researchers countered the claim .
warentest found that prices will actually rise for families with older children .
currently , families can purchase a " family bahncard , " entitling every member of a family up to the age of 27- to a 50-percent discount on rail travel within germany .
however , the new system lowers the age limit to 17 .
deutsche bahn is also eliminating the ice family saver ticket , which offers a considerable discount on germany 's high-speed trains to families traveling together .
expensive changes the price changes will also make train fares higher for single travelers , especially on short journeys .
with the current bahncard , holders receive a 50-percent discount on all trains - both regional and intercity .
under the new system , however , bahncard holders only receive a 25-percent discount - unless they book well in advance .
additionally , stiftung warentest criticized deutsche bahn for applying excessive new regulations for discounts and special offers and implementing exorbitant fees for making ticket changes .
for example , travelers who take a train other than the one they have reserved will be subjected to a ticket-change fee running as high as 45 euros -lrb- $ 44.80 -rrb- in each direction .
winners but stiftung warentest did manage to find praise for at least a few aspects of the new pricing structure .
for example , small groups of up to five people traveling together can take advantage of both group discounts and an early booking discount .
the result is fares that can run 20-40 percent lower than current group ticket prices .
warentest also praised savings for families traveling with children between the ages of six and 14 , who can now travel more cheaply .
the organization said deutsche bahn had made a wise choice in the new structure by allowing passengers to combine any available discounts together - be it through a bahncard , a special offer or group travel .
stung by the overall poor marks from stiftung warentest , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn said the criticism was unwarranted .
he accused the consumer organization of issuing an unbalanced report .

15 , germany 's national railway will introduce a new pricing system .
deutsche bahn claims its new fares will make travel cheaper , but a prominent consumer organization says that 's not the case . in a report released this week , consumer group stiftung warentest , which is germany 's answer to " consumer reports , " gave the new pricing system mixed reviews , saying deutsche bahn failed to deliver the savings it promised .
warentest workers compared a total of 1,600 fares from the new system with the lowest-possible fares available under the current system .
the organization found that , for many , bahn 's new system will result in higher fares .
deutsche bahn 's new price structure is modeled after the airlines , which offer travelers considerable savings if they book early .
bahn hopes the system will enable it to better plan its revenues , meet demand and fill trains .
the biggest losers : families in its statements about the system , deutsche bahn has said that families will be the biggest winners under the new fares , but stiftung warentest 's researchers countered the claim .
warentest found that prices will actually rise for families with older children .
currently , families can purchase a " family bahncard , " entitling every member of a family up to the age of 27- to a 50-percent discount on rail travel within germany .
however , the new system lowers the age limit to 17 .
deutsche bahn is also eliminating the ice family saver ticket , which offers a considerable discount on germany 's high-speed trains to families traveling together .
expensive changes the price changes will also make train fares higher for single travelers , especially on short journeys .
with the current bahncard , holders receive a 50-percent discount on all trains - both regional and intercity .
under the new system , however , bahncard holders only receive a 25-percent discount - unless they book well in advance .
additionally , stiftung warentest criticized deutsche bahn for applying excessive new regulations for discounts and special offers and implementing exorbitant fees for making ticket changes .
for example , travelers who take a train other than the one they have reserved will be subjected to a ticket-change fee running as high as 45 euros -lrb- $ 44.80 -rrb- in each direction .
winners but stiftung warentest did manage to find praise for at least a few aspects of the new pricing structure .
for example , small groups of up to five people traveling together can take advantage of both group discounts and an early booking discount .
the result is fares that can run 20-40 percent lower than current group ticket prices .
warentest also praised savings for families traveling with children between the ages of six and 14 , who can now travel more cheaply .
the organization said deutsche bahn had made a wise choice in the new structure by allowing passengers to combine any available discounts together - be it through a bahncard , a special offer or group travel .
stung by the overall poor marks from stiftung warentest , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn said the criticism was unwarranted .
he accused the consumer organization of issuing an unbalanced report .
mehdorn said stiftung warentest researchers pulled out just a few fares that were designed to give a distorted and negative image of the national railway .
mehdorn is also standing behind the company 's statements that train travel will be cheaper for millions of people under the new pricing system and not just a few bargain hunters .

warentest workers compared a total of 1,600 fares from the new system with the lowest-possible fares available under the current system .
the organization found that , for many , bahn 's new system will result in higher fares .
deutsche bahn 's new price structure is modeled after the airlines , which offer travelers considerable savings if they book early .
bahn hopes the system will enable it to better plan its revenues , meet demand and fill trains .
the biggest losers : families in its statements about the system , deutsche bahn has said that families will be the biggest winners under the new fares , but stiftung warentest 's researchers countered the claim .
warentest found that prices will actually rise for families with older children .
currently , families can purchase a " family bahncard , " entitling every member of a family up to the age of 27- to a 50-percent discount on rail travel within germany .
however , the new system lowers the age limit to 17 .
deutsche bahn is also eliminating the ice family saver ticket , which offers a considerable discount on germany 's high-speed trains to families traveling together .
expensive changes the price changes will also make train fares higher for single travelers , especially on short journeys .
with the current bahncard , holders receive a 50-percent discount on all trains - both regional and intercity .
under the new system , however , bahncard holders only receive a 25-percent discount - unless they book well in advance .
additionally , stiftung warentest criticized deutsche bahn for applying excessive new regulations for discounts and special offers and implementing exorbitant fees for making ticket changes .
for example , travelers who take a train other than the one they have reserved will be subjected to a ticket-change fee running as high as 45 euros -lrb- $ 44.80 -rrb- in each direction .
winners but stiftung warentest did manage to find praise for at least a few aspects of the new pricing structure .
for example , small groups of up to five people traveling together can take advantage of both group discounts and an early booking discount .
the result is fares that can run 20-40 percent lower than current group ticket prices .
warentest also praised savings for families traveling with children between the ages of six and 14 , who can now travel more cheaply .
the organization said deutsche bahn had made a wise choice in the new structure by allowing passengers to combine any available discounts together - be it through a bahncard , a special offer or group travel .
stung by the overall poor marks from stiftung warentest , deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn said the criticism was unwarranted .
he accused the consumer organization of issuing an unbalanced report .
mehdorn said stiftung warentest researchers pulled out just a few fares that were designed to give a distorted and negative image of the national railway .
mehdorn is also standing behind the company 's statements that train travel will be cheaper for millions of people under the new pricing system and not just a few bargain hunters .

firefighters broke off from their strike to attend the blaze , in maidstone , and were later joined by two military green goddess fire engines .
the man was pulled unconscious from the blaze but died later at maidstone hospital .
factory fire police officers and paramedics were first on the scene , but had been beaten back by flames as they attempted to pull the man to safety .
a spokesman for the ministry of defence said : " the breathing apparatus rescue team then arrived and went into the building and brought the person out .
" the kent fire brigade arrived shortly after that and helped the breathing apparatus rescue team tackle the fire and then the green goddesses arrived .
" unfortunately the man was pronounced dead at maidstone hospital . "

eighteen appliances including four red goddess and four rescue teams attended the blaze at the plastics factory on phoenix street at 1415 gmt on friday .
the disused factory is close to a petrol station and an industrial estate .
the building was destroyed but neighbouring buildings were saved .
firefighters on strike nearby left their picket line after being told someone was trapped inside .

retained firefighters and a green goddess from redditch were called to the scene of the crash involving a car and a lorry in pershore , worcestershire .

a man suffered head injuries and was confirmed dead at the scene .
two other people were injured .
first fires one of the first fires in england was reported at about 0935 gmt in the west midlands .

about 19,000 military personnel are providing fire cover during the stoppage .
as well as operating the ageing green goddess appliances , servicemen and women are also being given access to 18 red goddesses .
the red engines - used by the fire service training college in gloucestershire - boast greater pumping capacity and are faster than the green goddesses .

well , make the most of it while you can because - according to a report - that particular occupation could soon be a thing of the past .
you 're more likely to be fiddling with your next-generation mobile phone or playing with your pda in 10 years time , apparently .
the report , published by bournemouth media school , brought together leading industry experts to consider what uk broadcasting could look like by 2012 .
a panel looked at four possible future scenarios , each dependent on the economy and the government of the day .
tv centre could be put out of business the most radical of the four sees a future in which the bbc has haemorrhaged support because viewers have become far too technology-savvy to be happy with run-of-the-mill tv .
according to the " goodbye tv " scenario , pdas and next generation mobile phones would , by this time , be in every briefcase and pocket .
in the home , new technology would be used increasingly to view dvds and access games and tv consumption would have dropped to an all-time low .
the most likely outcome - according to the report - would be that , within five years , the bbc 's tv channels would close altogether .
its radio and online services would thrive , however .
but is this really likely ?
not according to bournemouth university spokesman charles elder .
" there is something homely about television , something comforting , " he said .
" i ca n't see people turning their back on television just yet .
" in 40 years time my grandchildren may have a very different view , however . "
worst case scenario another of the four scenarios sees the full potential of digital technologies realised .
this is a world in which there has been sustained economic growth .
consumers have become wealthier , better educated and more liberal in their views .
broadband britain has arrived - and the digital switchover achieved .
this scenario sees the bbc retain its public service broadcaster status , but predicts that public support will have drifted away .
big brother for sale : channel 4 could be privatised the worst case scenario sees a back-to-basics future in which a prolonged recession , fuelled by tension in the middle east , has led to marked social unrest .
conventional tv remains a key part of people 's lives and the switch to broadband britain has been abandoned .
the bbc is the only uk player able to sustain investment and channel 4 receives part of the licence fee - in return for cutting its commercial ventures .
the fourth , and final , scenario , is perhaps the most likely .
it predicts moderate economic growth and a strongly consumerist society .
in this society there has been a patchwork take-up of digital services - with 20 % of households still tuning in to analogue tv .
the bbc is still a main player and channel 4 is privatised , brought out by a global conglomerate .
" when we asked people which scenario they felt was the most likely , they said this one , " said christine daymon , who helped write the report .
dominant significantly , in two of the four scenarios , channel 4 is privatised .
in another it shares the licence fee with the bbc .
currently it is a government-owned corporation which supports itself .
by contrast , all four scenarios expected a licence-fee funded bbc to remain a dominant player in the medium term , but identified a longer-term threat to the licence-fee with digital take-up .
" the point of this work is to encourage the industry to anticipate change , rather than just react to it , " said roger laughton , head of bournemouth media school .
" thinking harder does n't mean you can predict what is going to happen , " he added .
" what it does mean is that you will be better prepared for it . "

the schoolchildren teamed up with a group from derry in northern ireland to create a video called flippin ' trippin ' . "
the video shows how many people die each year from smoking " filmmaker josie hough the programme , which was put together at yale college , will be shown in schools and youth clubs throughout the region .
one woman in the video , who remained anonymous , said drug-taking was a widespread problem in the area .
" practically every youngster takes drugs in wrexham , " she said .
" there 's not much to do here and nobody 's got much money , so that 's a cheap alternative , i suppose . "
rather than telling people not to take drugs , the video warns them to get all the facts before they do .
young film-maker josie hough said the material was very informative .
" in the video , there are helpline numbers and drug information numbers .
" it also shows how many people die each year from smoking , and asks questions to the public and shows their answers . "
community the film was shot on the streets of wrexham and shoppers were randomly asked about substance misuse in the town .
patrice abernethy , youth forum co-ordinator said the scheme should prove worthwhile .
" if young people can relate to a young person or another member of the community they see , that has an important influence over them , " she said .
" it may give them a different viewpoint . "
the teenagers have also formed a peer education group and will tour schools together to show the flippin ' trippin ' video .
