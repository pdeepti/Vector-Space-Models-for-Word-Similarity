the 300 caterers , cleaners and porters at glasgow royal infirmary have begun a three-day walkout following unanimous rejection of a £ 5-an-hour pay offer .
management from private employer sodexho and unions spent several hours in talks on friday in an effort to resolve the dispute .
unions say the offer is too vague however , differences over terms and conditions for contract staff employed by the company have proved to be a burning issue .
the workers began further strike action at midnight on monday and that is expected to last three days .
they are planning to strike for a further three days next week if the pay dispute is not resolved .
unison branch secretary carolyn leckie said the union could not recommend acceptance of the latest offer .
she said : " the way things stand at the moment , sodexho are saying they will come back with improved terms and conditions by 2005 which is a long way off and too vague .
" we are happy to talk to sodexho again but they need to put a better offer on the table - the workers are being treated as second-class citizens . "
sodexho used staff from elsewhere last week when workers staged a two-day stoppage .

the review has been hailed as a vision for a future bilingual wales , but some language activists who will be at the festival in st david 's , pembrokeshire , are sceptical .
the chair of the assembly 's culture committee , rhodri glyn thomas will face critics on the maes during the second full day of the cultural festival .
he will hold a question and answer session at the welsh assembly 's stand .
the committee has spent more than a year looking at ways to protect and promote the language , and the recommendations are likely to come under close scrutiny .
committee members have said they want to boost the provision of nursery education and the number of welsh language initiatives .
they also want to create language action zones .
but activists such as huw lewis from cymdeithas yr iaith gymraeg - the welsh language society - have said the proposals do not go far enough .
" the culture committee has decided to step back from getting to grips with the roots of the problem in order to create a cosy consensus around less radical solutions , " he said .
organisers of the eight-day festival expect more than 160,000 people to attend the eisteddfod during the week of poetry , music and the performing arts .
crowds turned up on monday to see two highlights - the induction of the future archbishop of canterbury , rowan williams , to the gorsedd of the bards , and the crowning of aled jones williams for his poem , breezes .

representatives of north korea and the unc , which oversees an armistice between the north and the south , met at the border village of panmunjom to discuss the western sea border following a fatal naval clash in june .
major general james soligan of the unc described his meeting with the delegation led by north korea 's lieutenant general yi chong-bok as " very positive " .
" these talks today proved that positive progress can be made only through open dialogue , " he said .
a unc statement said the two sides agreed on the need for better communication , including regular staff-level meetings , in order to avoid another naval confrontation .
" details of these measures will be discussed in future talks , " the statement said .
northern limit line declared by un in 1953 not officially recognised by north regularly breached by north 's navy see also : unresolved conflict four south korean sailors were killed in the june fighting , and a fifth is still missing .
south korea officials believe that 13 north korean soldiers were killed or injured .
the unc announcement followed media reports from panmunjom that the two sides were swapping protests over the june clash .
north korea reportedly demanded that a new maritime border be established with the south , reiterating its argument that the existing northern limit line -lrb- nll -rrb- is illegal .
the nll was drawn up by the us after the 1950-53 korean war .
both north and south korea claim that their worst maritime clash in three years was initiated by the other , although north korea has since expressed " regret " over the incident .
this has opened the way for a break in the impasse between the two sides and high-level talks are scheduled for 12-14 august in seoul .

north korean foreign minister paek nam-sun met us secretary of state colin powell and japanese foreign minister yoriko kawaguchi during a regional security forum in brunei last week .
following those talks , north korea said it had agreed to resume talks with tokyo and washington .
meanwhile , south korean and american warships and aircraft are on alert along the disputed korean naval border as preparations continue for an operation to recover the vessel which was sunk during the june clash .
a rescue team of 60 navy frog-men and five salvage ships - including a submarine - have been deployed for the operation , which is expected to take around two months .
seoul 's attempts to salvage the boat which sunk in the clash were hampered for a second day on tuesday because of bad weather .

representatives of north korea and the unc , which oversees an armistice between the north and the south , met at the border village of panmunjom to discuss the western sea border following a fatal naval clash in june .
major general james soligan of the unc described his meeting with the delegation led by north korea 's lieutenant general yi chong-bok as " very positive " .
" these talks today proved that positive progress can be made only through open dialogue , " he said .
a unc statement said the two sides agreed on the need for better communication , including regular staff-level meetings , in order to avoid another naval confrontation .
" details of these measures will be discussed in future talks , " the statement said .
northern limit line declared by un in 1953 not officially recognised by north regularly breached by north 's navy see also : four south korean sailors were killed in the june fighting , and a fifth is still missing .
south korea officials believe that 13 north korean soldiers were killed or injured .
the unc announcement followed media reports from panmunjom that the two sides were swapping protests over the june clash .
north korea reportedly demanded that a new maritime border be established with the south , reiterating its argument that the existing northern limit line -lrb- nll -rrb- is illegal .
the nll was drawn up by the us after the 1950-53 korean war .
both north and south korea claim that their worst maritime clash in three years was initiated by the other , although north korea has since expressed " regret " over the incident .
this has opened the way for a break in the impasse between the two sides and high-level talks are scheduled for 12-14 august in seoul .
diplomacy there has been a flurry of diplomatic activity centred around isolationist pyongyang in recent days .
north korean foreign minister paek nam-sun met us secretary of state colin powell and japanese foreign minister yoriko kawaguchi during a regional security forum in brunei last week .
following those talks , north korea said it had agreed to resume talks with tokyo and washington .
meanwhile , south korean and american warships and aircraft are on alert along the disputed korean naval border as preparations continue for an operation to recover the vessel which was sunk during the june clash .
a rescue team of 60 navy frog-men and five salvage ships - including a submarine - have been deployed for the operation , which is expected to take around two months .
seoul 's attempts to salvage the boat which sunk in the clash were hampered for a second day on tuesday because of bad weather .
