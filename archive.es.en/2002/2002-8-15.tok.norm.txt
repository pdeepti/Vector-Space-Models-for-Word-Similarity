has the green party found a new weapon against the conservative opposition ? the storms that have wreaked havoc in southern and eastern germany this past week have presented an unintended political opportunity for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government coallition .
lagging behind the christian democratic union and chrisitian social union in the polls before the sept .
22 elections , schröder ’ s social democratic and green party coalition government has used the flooding to tout their environmental record and attack the union ’ s lack of an environmental vision .
the greens took special issue with chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s failure to appoint a person responsible for environmental affairs in his much-publicised shadow cabinet .
" in the face of the ongoing natural catastrophe , candidate stoiber should reflect on why nobody in his so-called competence team is responsible for the environment , " green foreign minister joschka fischer told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper on tuesday .
" precisely in stoiber ’ s bavaria , there was unchecked construction in the flooded areas . "
weak spot in the opposition 's programme the political pressure on stoiber to think out a sound policy for the long-term consequences of climatic change is now growing .
on tuesday several spd and green politicians as well as representatives from environmental organisations called up stoiber to urge him to appoint an environmental expert in his cabinet .
a recent study by the german environmental ministry showing that just 25 percent of all german environmental activists are in favour of a cdu / csu coalition , has put more heat on stoiber to take action .
the environmental spokesperson of the greens , reinhard loske accused stoiber of " environmental ignorance " .
in a statement he said , " those such as the union who want to end the eco tax and reject the further expansion of renewable energies , are dealing in an utter irresponsible manner " .
a solid government record , say advocates the so-called “ eco tax ” is considered by advocates to be one of the great achievements of schröder ’ s coalition government since it came to power in 1998 .
the tax , placed on everything from fuel to electricity , is meant to spur conservation by gradually increasing the cost of energy and raw materials , kick-start investment aimed at energy conservation and generate revenues to bring down labour costs .
the red-green coalition added another environmental victory to its balance when in june 2000 it got the nuclear industry to agree on the phasing out of nuclear power in germany within the next 30 years .
the two proposals , celebrated by many in the international community , were viewed as a giant step towards achieving the german government ’ s objective of reducing co2 emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2005 .
both proposals have come under heavy criticism by industry leaders and opposition parties . business leaders felt the eco tax would scare away consumers fearing higher electricity bills and rising gasoline costs . opposition parties have maintained that nuclear energy is the most inexpensive form of energy currently available .
opposition still in favour of nuclear energy stoiber and the rest of the union have stuck to that message .
even in the face of the present catastrophe , a government led by the union parties will continue to rely on the entire spectrum of energy sources – even nuclear energy .
a hike in the ecological tax is also out of the question , said party officials .
" many people don ’ t like it when we say that we will use nuclear energy in the future .
but if we do away with nuclear energy , climate protection will become endlessly expensive , " klaus lippold , the party ’ s environmental expert and vice president of their parliamentary group , told the neue presse in hanover .
he said that the union will advocate " self-regulation on the part of the industry " to achieve climate protection goals .
meanwhile , as floods wreak havoc and claim lives in large regions of southern and eastern germany – particularly in saxony , saxony anhalt and bavaria – both chancellor schröder and his conservative challenger , stoiber have rushed to the worst-affected cities of dresden and passau in bavaria respectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly storms lash europe germany , the czech republic and austria were the hardest hit in the latest round of storms , which have claimed more than 70 lives across the continent in the past week . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

bavaria 's high-flying it sector has earned the state the nickname as one of " laptops and lederhosen . "
but the german government is eager to prove the rest of germany is catching up . one of eastern germany 's most prestigious investment projects in the it sector , communicant semiconductors technologies , celebrated its cornerstone-laying ceremony on wednesday .
it comes as no surprise that education and research minister edelgard bulmahn stepped in for chancellor gerhard schröder , who had to cancel his visit to the ceremony to visit the flooded regions in eastern germany .
research development is of key interest to the federal government .
in communist east germany , frankfurt on the oder was a center for microelectronics .
but following german reunification , it could n't keep up with the competition from the west .
communicant wants to change that .
and it 's counting on support from berlin .
" this is a good day for the state of brandenburg , " said bulmahn , adding that communicant 's success was important for the federal government .
the 1.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- factory will produce microchips and is expected to begin production in 2004 .
in addition to 1,500 people working at the facility itself , communicant said it anticipates 1,300 further jobs in the service and supply sectors - a welcome change in a region suffering from an unemployment rate of around 20 percent .
major investors are semiconductor giant intel and the emirate dubai .
but the federal government and the state of brandenburg will also contribute 320 million euro -lrb- $ 316 million -rrb- .
education and research for the future the social democratic-green coalition government in berlin has focused on promoting germany as a country geared for the future .
according to the ministry of education and research bmbf , germany has never invested more in education and research projects in its history .
since 1998 , the bmbf budget has jumped over 21 percent to 8.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 8.68 billion -rrb- .
the largest sum is devoted to the it sector .
over the past four years , financing for information technology has increased 13.6 percent to 279.5 million euro -lrb- $ 275.7 million -rrb- , bmbf said .
in 1999 , the bmbf , together with the federal economics ministry , also launched a five-year program called " innovation and jobs in the information society of the 21st century " .
its aims include improving access to new media , promoting multimedia in schools and boosting the it and communication sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn earlier this year , the government presented interim results - and hailed the program as a great success .
" germany is more future-oriented than ever before , " said bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- .
information and communication technologies sectors had developed into a leading economic sector , contributing to 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product .
also , e-commerce in germany was posting turnover of some 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.7 billion -rrb- , making it the number one in europe for this sector , the government said .
a downward trend in it the german association for information technology , telecommunications and new media , bitkom , welcomed the initiative .
" the federal government achieved its goal of giving significant impulses for a stronger and wider use of information and communication technology , " bitkom 's director general bernhard rohleder said in a statement .
internet access technology , in particular , had expanded .
but , he added , more needs to be done in the education system .
media competence should be integrated as a permanent component of teacher education .
further education in internet use should also be improved , rohleder said .
despite the efforts by the berlin government , the number of jobs in the it and telecommunications sector is declining - for the first time since the early 1990s .
according to bitkom , employment is down 3.4 percent to 791,000 jobs in 2002 .
producers of mobile phones and networks are slashing the most positions , the organization says .
but these cuts do not affect top positions .
" jobs are being cut almost exclusively in administration and distribution , " says stephan pfisterer of bitkom .
this includes many people who entered the it sector from other branches .
" but there is still a demand for it specialists with university degrees or many year 's experience , " he added .
laptops and lederhosen the true home of it in germany is the southern state of bavaria .
the state has introduced several successful programs to attract investors from the new economy sector .
apple , cisco , compaq , microsoft , oracle and sun microsystems are just a few of the companies that have their european or german headquarters in bavaria .
prime minister edmund stoiber , who is the opposition candidate for chancellor in the upcoming federal elections , is making no secret of this success story .
unemployment in bavaria is almost half the national average while it leads the country in per capita income .
the transition from an agricultural state 50 years ago to the " high-tech mecca " of europe , as microsoft founder bill gates has called bavaria , is no accident .
" to help bavaria stay in the fast lane , the state has divested itself of several industries and reinvested the proceeds from privatization amounting to some $ 4 billion in a massive program called ' future initiative bavaria ' , " said minister erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery , in a statement . " this program is used to finance investments in the industrial and scientific infrastructure , " huber said .

bavaria 's high-flying it sector has earned the state the nickname as one of " laptops and lederhosen . "
but the german government is eager to prove the rest of germany is catching up . one of eastern germany 's most prestigious investment projects in the it sector , communicant semiconductors technologies , celebrated its cornerstone-laying ceremony on wednesday .
it comes as no surprise that education and research minister edelgard bulmahn stepped in for chancellor gerhard schröder , who had to cancel his visit to the ceremony to visit the flooded regions in eastern germany .
research development is of key interest to the federal government .
in communist east germany , frankfurt on the oder was a center for microelectronics .
but following german reunification , it could n't keep up with the competition from the west .
communicant wants to change that .
and it 's counting on support from berlin .
" this is a good day for the state of brandenburg , " said bulmahn , adding that communicant 's success was important for the federal government .
the 1.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- factory will produce microchips and is expected to begin production in 2004 .
in addition to 1,500 people working at the facility itself , communicant said it anticipates 1,300 further jobs in the service and supply sectors - a welcome change in a region suffering from an unemployment rate of around 20 percent .
major investors are semiconductor giant intel and the emirate dubai .
but the federal government and the state of brandenburg will also contribute 320 million euro -lrb- $ 316 million -rrb- .
education and research for the future the social democratic-green coalition government in berlin has focused on promoting germany as a country geared for the future .
according to the ministry of education and research bmbf , germany has never invested more in education and research projects in its history .
since 1998 , the bmbf budget has jumped over 21 percent to 8.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 8.68 billion -rrb- .
the largest sum is devoted to the it sector .
over the past four years , financing for information technology has increased 13.6 percent to 279.5 million euro -lrb- $ 275.7 million -rrb- , bmbf said .
in 1999 , the bmbf , together with the federal economics ministry , also launched a five-year program called " innovation and jobs in the information society of the 21st century " .
its aims include improving access to new media , promoting multimedia in schools and boosting the it and communication sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn earlier this year , the government presented interim results - and hailed the program as a great success .
" germany is more future-oriented than ever before , " said bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- .
information and communication technologies sectors had developed into a leading economic sector , contributing to 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product .
also , e-commerce in germany was posting turnover of some 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.7 billion -rrb- , making it the number one in europe for this sector , the government said .
a downward trend in it the german association for information technology , telecommunications and new media , bitkom , welcomed the initiative .
" the federal government achieved its goal of giving significant impulses for a stronger and wider use of information and communication technology , " bitkom 's director general bernhard rohleder said in a statement .
internet access technology , in particular , had expanded .
but , he added , more needs to be done in the education system .
media competence should be integrated as a permanent component of teacher education .
further education in internet use should also be improved , rohleder said .
despite the efforts by the berlin government , the number of jobs in the it and telecommunications sector is declining - for the first time since the early 1990s .
according to bitkom , employment is down 3.4 percent to 791,000 jobs in 2002 .
producers of mobile phones and networks are slashing the most positions , the organization says .
but these cuts do not affect top positions .
" jobs are being cut almost exclusively in administration and distribution , " says stephan pfisterer of bitkom .
this includes many people who entered the it sector from other branches .
" but there is still a demand for it specialists with university degrees or many year 's experience , " he added .
laptops and lederhosen the true home of it in germany is the southern state of bavaria .
the state has introduced several successful programs to attract investors from the new economy sector .
apple , cisco , compaq , microsoft , oracle and sun microsystems are just a few of the companies that have their european or german headquarters in bavaria .
prime minister edmund stoiber , who is the opposition candidate for chancellor in the upcoming federal elections , is making no secret of this success story .
unemployment in bavaria is almost half the national average while it leads the country in per capita income .
the transition from an agricultural state 50 years ago to the " high-tech mecca " of europe , as microsoft founder bill gates has called bavaria , is no accident .
" to help bavaria stay in the fast lane , the state has divested itself of several industries and reinvested the proceeds from privatization amounting to some $ 4 billion in a massive program called ' future initiative bavaria ' , " said minister erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery , in a statement . " this program is used to finance investments in the industrial and scientific infrastructure , " huber said .
" with a view to consolidating and further enhancing bavaria 's top position as a leading high-tech region in europe .

has the green party found a new weapon against the conservative opposition ? the storms that have wreaked havoc in southern and eastern germany this past week have presented an unintended political opportunity for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government coallition .
lagging behind the christian democratic union and chrisitian social union in the polls before the sept .
22 elections , schröder ’ s social democratic and green party coalition government has used the flooding to tout their environmental record and attack the union ’ s lack of an environmental vision .
the greens took special issue with chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s failure to appoint a person responsible for environmental affairs in his much-publicised shadow cabinet .
" in the face of the ongoing natural catastrophe , candidate stoiber should reflect on why nobody in his so-called competence team is responsible for the environment , " green foreign minister joschka fischer told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper on tuesday .
" precisely in stoiber ’ s bavaria , there was unchecked construction in the flooded areas . "
weak spot in the opposition 's programme the political pressure on stoiber to think out a sound policy for the long-term consequences of climatic change is now growing .
on tuesday several spd and green politicians as well as representatives from environmental organisations called up stoiber to urge him to appoint an environmental expert in his cabinet .
a recent study by the german environmental ministry showing that just 25 percent of all german environmental activists are in favour of a cdu / csu coalition , has put more heat on stoiber to take action .
the environmental spokesperson of the greens , reinhard loske accused stoiber of " environmental ignorance " .
in a statement he said , " those such as the union who want to end the eco tax and reject the further expansion of renewable energies , are dealing in an utter irresponsible manner " .
a solid government record , say advocates the so-called “ eco tax ” is considered by advocates to be one of the great achievements of schröder ’ s coalition government since it came to power in 1998 .
the tax , placed on everything from fuel to electricity , is meant to spur conservation by gradually increasing the cost of energy and raw materials , kick-start investment aimed at energy conservation and generate revenues to bring down labour costs .
the red-green coalition added another environmental victory to its balance when in june 2000 it got the nuclear industry to agree on the phasing out of nuclear power in germany within the next 30 years .
the two proposals , celebrated by many in the international community , were viewed as a giant step towards achieving the german government ’ s objective of reducing co2 emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2005 .
both proposals have come under heavy criticism by industry leaders and opposition parties . business leaders felt the eco tax would scare away consumers fearing higher electricity bills and rising gasoline costs . opposition parties have maintained that nuclear energy is the most inexpensive form of energy currently available .
opposition still in favour of nuclear energy stoiber and the rest of the union have stuck to that message .
even in the face of the present catastrophe , a government led by the union parties will continue to rely on the entire spectrum of energy sources – even nuclear energy .
a hike in the ecological tax is also out of the question , said party officials .
" many people don ’ t like it when we say that we will use nuclear energy in the future .
but if we do away with nuclear energy , climate protection will become endlessly expensive , " klaus lippold , the party ’ s environmental expert and vice president of their parliamentary group , told the neue presse in hanover .
he said that the union will advocate " self-regulation on the part of the industry " to achieve climate protection goals .
meanwhile , as floods wreak havoc and claim lives in large regions of southern and eastern germany – particularly in saxony , saxony anhalt and bavaria – both chancellor schröder and his conservative challenger , stoiber have rushed to the worst-affected cities of dresden and passau in bavaria respectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly storms lash europe germany , the czech republic and austria were the hardest hit in the latest round of storms , which have claimed more than 70 lives across the continent in the past week . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the state has introduced several successful programs to attract investors from the new economy sector .
apple , cisco , compaq , microsoft , oracle and sun microsystems are just a few of the companies that have their european or german headquarters in bavaria .
prime minister edmund stoiber , who is the opposition candidate for chancellor in the upcoming federal elections , is making no secret of this success story .

the transition from an agricultural state 50 years ago to the " high-tech mecca " of europe , as microsoft founder bill gates has called bavaria , is no accident .
" to help bavaria stay in the fast lane , the state has divested itself of several industries and reinvested the proceeds from privatization amounting to some $ 4 billion in a massive program called ' future initiative bavaria ' , " said minister erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery , in a statement .

has the green party found a new weapon against the conservative opposition ? the storms that have wreaked havoc in southern and eastern germany this past week have presented an unintended political opportunity for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government coallition .
lagging behind the christian democratic union and chrisitian social union in the polls before the sept .
22 elections , schröder ’ s social democratic and green party coalition government has used the flooding to tout their environmental record and attack the union ’ s lack of an environmental vision .
the greens took special issue with chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s failure to appoint a person responsible for environmental affairs in his much-publicised shadow cabinet .
" in the face of the ongoing natural catastrophe , candidate stoiber should reflect on why nobody in his so-called competence team is responsible for the environment , " green foreign minister joschka fischer told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper on tuesday .
" precisely in stoiber ’ s bavaria , there was unchecked construction in the flooded areas . "
weak spot in the opposition 's programme the political pressure on stoiber to think out a sound policy for the long-term consequences of climatic change is now growing .
on tuesday several spd and green politicians as well as representatives from environmental organisations called up stoiber to urge him to appoint an environmental expert in his cabinet .
a recent study by the german environmental ministry showing that just 25 percent of all german environmental activists are in favour of a cdu / csu coalition , has put more heat on stoiber to take action .
the environmental spokesperson of the greens , reinhard loske accused stoiber of " environmental ignorance " .
in a statement he said , " those such as the union who want to end the eco tax and reject the further expansion of renewable energies , are dealing in an utter irresponsible manner " .
a solid government record , say advocates the so-called “ eco tax ” is considered by advocates to be one of the great achievements of schröder ’ s coalition government since it came to power in 1998 .
the tax , placed on everything from fuel to electricity , is meant to spur conservation by gradually increasing the cost of energy and raw materials , kick-start investment aimed at energy conservation and generate revenues to bring down labour costs .
the red-green coalition added another environmental victory to its balance when in june 2000 it got the nuclear industry to agree on the phasing out of nuclear power in germany within the next 30 years .
the two proposals , celebrated by many in the international community , were viewed as a giant step towards achieving the german government ’ s objective of reducing co2 emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2005 .
both proposals have come under heavy criticism by industry leaders and opposition parties . business leaders felt the eco tax would scare away consumers fearing higher electricity bills and rising gasoline costs . opposition parties have maintained that nuclear energy is the most inexpensive form of energy currently available .
opposition still in favour of nuclear energy stoiber and the rest of the union have stuck to that message .
even in the face of the present catastrophe , a government led by the union parties will continue to rely on the entire spectrum of energy sources – even nuclear energy .
a hike in the ecological tax is also out of the question , said party officials .
" many people don ’ t like it when we say that we will use nuclear energy in the future .
but if we do away with nuclear energy , climate protection will become endlessly expensive , " klaus lippold , the party ’ s environmental expert and vice president of their parliamentary group , told the neue presse in hanover .
he said that the union will advocate " self-regulation on the part of the industry " to achieve climate protection goals .

bavaria 's high-flying it sector has earned the state the nickname as one of " laptops and lederhosen . "
but the german government is eager to prove the rest of germany is catching up . one of eastern germany 's most prestigious investment projects in the it sector , communicant semiconductors technologies , celebrated its cornerstone-laying ceremony on wednesday .
it comes as no surprise that education and research minister edelgard bulmahn stepped in for chancellor gerhard schröder , who had to cancel his visit to the ceremony to visit the flooded regions in eastern germany .
research development is of key interest to the federal government .
in communist east germany , frankfurt on the oder was a center for microelectronics .
but following german reunification , it could n't keep up with the competition from the west .
communicant wants to change that .
and it 's counting on support from berlin .
" this is a good day for the state of brandenburg , " said bulmahn , adding that communicant 's success was important for the federal government .
the 1.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- factory will produce microchips and is expected to begin production in 2004 .
in addition to 1,500 people working at the facility itself , communicant said it anticipates 1,300 further jobs in the service and supply sectors - a welcome change in a region suffering from an unemployment rate of around 20 percent .
major investors are semiconductor giant intel and the emirate dubai .
but the federal government and the state of brandenburg will also contribute 320 million euro -lrb- $ 316 million -rrb- .
education and research for the future the social democratic-green coalition government in berlin has focused on promoting germany as a country geared for the future .
according to the ministry of education and research bmbf , germany has never invested more in education and research projects in its history .
since 1998 , the bmbf budget has jumped over 21 percent to 8.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 8.68 billion -rrb- .
the largest sum is devoted to the it sector .
over the past four years , financing for information technology has increased 13.6 percent to 279.5 million euro -lrb- $ 275.7 million -rrb- , bmbf said .
in 1999 , the bmbf , together with the federal economics ministry , also launched a five-year program called " innovation and jobs in the information society of the 21st century " .
its aims include improving access to new media , promoting multimedia in schools and boosting the it and communication sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn earlier this year , the government presented interim results - and hailed the program as a great success .
" germany is more future-oriented than ever before , " said bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- .
information and communication technologies sectors had developed into a leading economic sector , contributing to 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product .
also , e-commerce in germany was posting turnover of some 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.7 billion -rrb- , making it the number one in europe for this sector , the government said .

internet access technology , in particular , had expanded .
but , he added , more needs to be done in the education system .
media competence should be integrated as a permanent component of teacher education .
further education in internet use should also be improved , rohleder said .
despite the efforts by the berlin government , the number of jobs in the it and telecommunications sector is declining - for the first time since the early 1990s .

the exhibition was an instant success , attracting more than 3 million visitors in new york alone since it opened last fall . now the exhibit is drawing similar crowds in berlin , where it kicked off a european tour in the historic martin gropius bau in early july . almost 50,000 visitors have flocked to the 500-photo show in its first few weeks – more than any other held in the museum in recent years , said arne mutert of the german interior ministry , which is co-sponsoring the german exhbitions together with the federal agency for civic education . the public 's to discuss munter said it was the show ’ s subtitle “ images of democracy ” that first caught the ministry ’ s attention . “ the most convincing argument for bringing the exhibition to berlin was its subtitle , ” mutert said in an interview with dw-world .
“ the show is a civic initative to cope with the events , and i think it 's very important that the discussion of september 11th is n't left up to the government .
if we want to come to terms with the event we need a broad civic discussion , and that ’ s what the exhibition does . ” visitors to “ here is new york , ” are allowed to formulate their own impressions and interpretations of the event , without the media ’ s filter , said mutert . “ it triggers discussion and gives motivation to rewrite the pictures in your head , giving you multiple perspectives , as opposed to the media ´ s 9/11 coverage , ” he said . berlin touch the berlin show has a home touch , an additional exhibition titled “ mein new york ” -lrb- my new york -rrb- , showcasing berliners ´ own pre-9/11 photos from ny , and their handwritten impressions , and feelings about the catastrophe . “ my husband worked from seven years on the wtc project as technical designer … new york was like our second home and the unthinkable catastrophe that has happened there , hurts us deeply , ” wrote mura grieius , of berlin , in the guest book laid out for the show .
“ we love that fascinating , lively , and sometimes difficult city , and its people .
we visit every year , and we continue to do so in the years to come . ” michael shulan , a new york writer who organized the exhibit with three photographer friends , said he was initially surprised by the great interest and resonance the show received abroad . in time , though , he has begun to see why . “ ground zero can stand for anywhere in the world , and this show is a presentation of people , reacting to things they don ’ t understand , and human emotion , ” he told dw-world .
“ 9/11 is only part of a larger story and now we understand this is only part of a larger problem . ” “ here is new york ” will also be presented in dresden , düsseldorf , stuttgart , and paris to mark the upcoming first anniversary of 9/11 .

has the green party found a new weapon against the conservative opposition ? the storms that have wreaked havoc in southern and eastern germany this past week have presented an unintended political opportunity for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government coallition .
lagging behind the christian democratic union and chrisitian social union in the polls before the sept .
22 elections , schröder ’ s social democratic and green party coalition government has used the flooding to tout their environmental record and attack the union ’ s lack of an environmental vision .
the greens took special issue with chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s failure to appoint a person responsible for environmental affairs in his much-publicised shadow cabinet .
" in the face of the ongoing natural catastrophe , candidate stoiber should reflect on why nobody in his so-called competence team is responsible for the environment , " green foreign minister joschka fischer told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper on tuesday .
" precisely in stoiber ’ s bavaria , there was unchecked construction in the flooded areas . "
weak spot in the opposition 's programme the political pressure on stoiber to think out a sound policy for the long-term consequences of climatic change is now growing .
on tuesday several spd and green politicians as well as representatives from environmental organisations called up stoiber to urge him to appoint an environmental expert in his cabinet .
a recent study by the german environmental ministry showing that just 25 percent of all german environmental activists are in favour of a cdu / csu coalition , has put more heat on stoiber to take action .
the environmental spokesperson of the greens , reinhard loske accused stoiber of " environmental ignorance " .
in a statement he said , " those such as the union who want to end the eco tax and reject the further expansion of renewable energies , are dealing in an utter irresponsible manner " .
a solid government record , say advocates the so-called “ eco tax ” is considered by advocates to be one of the great achievements of schröder ’ s coalition government since it came to power in 1998 .
the tax , placed on everything from fuel to electricity , is meant to spur conservation by gradually increasing the cost of energy and raw materials , kick-start investment aimed at energy conservation and generate revenues to bring down labour costs .
the red-green coalition added another environmental victory to its balance when in june 2000 it got the nuclear industry to agree on the phasing out of nuclear power in germany within the next 30 years .
the two proposals , celebrated by many in the international community , were viewed as a giant step towards achieving the german government ’ s objective of reducing co2 emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2005 .
both proposals have come under heavy criticism by industry leaders and opposition parties . business leaders felt the eco tax would scare away consumers fearing higher electricity bills and rising gasoline costs . opposition parties have maintained that nuclear energy is the most inexpensive form of energy currently available .
opposition still in favour of nuclear energy stoiber and the rest of the union have stuck to that message .
even in the face of the present catastrophe , a government led by the union parties will continue to rely on the entire spectrum of energy sources – even nuclear energy .
a hike in the ecological tax is also out of the question , said party officials .
" many people don ’ t like it when we say that we will use nuclear energy in the future .
but if we do away with nuclear energy , climate protection will become endlessly expensive , " klaus lippold , the party ’ s environmental expert and vice president of their parliamentary group , told the neue presse in hanover .
he said that the union will advocate " self-regulation on the part of the industry " to achieve climate protection goals .
meanwhile , as floods wreak havoc and claim lives in large regions of southern and eastern germany – particularly in saxony , saxony anhalt and bavaria – both chancellor schröder and his conservative challenger , stoiber have rushed to the worst-affected cities of dresden and passau in bavaria respectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly storms lash europe germany , the czech republic and austria were the hardest hit in the latest round of storms , which have claimed more than 70 lives across the continent in the past week .

at a time when european soccer is counting every euro cent and pence coin , the power previously in the hands of the players looks to be swinging back to the clubs . the financial bubble seems to have burst for european soccer and player power appears to be on the wane .
with clubs unable and unwilling to meet the sky-high transfer fees and personal demands of the world ’ s top stars , the question has reverted back from ‘ who can we afford to buy ? ’ to ‘ who has the desire to play ? ’
no longer is the discussion centred on the amount of zeroes on the wage slip .
recent reports document the increase in out-of-contract players appearing for nothing in a bid to get a job with cash-strapped clubs .
cash cow has been milked , clubs and players suffer lost revenue from television rights has meant capping of spiraling costs and in extreme cases , unemployment for players and closure for clubs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan effenberg headshot , as germany and bayern munich soccer player one high-profile casualty is former bayern munich captain and german national team player stefan effenberg .
priced out of a move to clubs in england and turkey , effenberg is looking at unemployment if he ca n't agree on a reduction of his superstar salary .
with the collapse of the kirchmedia empire in germany and english clubs left in limbo by the dissolved itvdigital company , the cash cow that provided the means for phenomenal weekly wages has been well and truly milked and put out to pasture .
despite financial problems , the european leagues are still the most attractive in the world .
the overwhelming popularity of the game , matched with the most high profile competitions still continue to bring foreign imports into the game .
the bundesliga continues to invest despite problems germany ’ s bundesliga is suffering as much as any .
an annual budget of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- , a quarter of the money available over the past few years , means that clubs are less likely to make expensive forays into the transfer market and players wanting a move must show a willingness to compromise .
however , a number of brazilian stars have persuaded clubs to brave the slump and are currently on show in the bundesliga this season , which kicked off last weekend .
the money is there to bring brazilian stars to germany every top german club has at least two brazilians on their books and there are a total of 25 of them playing in the bundesliga 's top flight .
with brazilian players especially in vogue following the national team 's victory at this summer 's world cup , german teams are investing their hard-earned euros in south american talent .
it seems the passion for the game and the need to compete at the highest level has brought stars from the world cup winning squad to german shores in search of a game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ze roberto moved to munich despite the current situation .
the current financial climate has n't stopped clubs like bayern munich spending 9.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.5 million euros -rrb- to take rival bayer leverkusen 's brazilian ze roberto to the olympiastadion to meet up with an expensive array of fellow countrymen .
a fellow south american in never far away " if a brazilian moves to a german club , he is likely to find a fellow countryman there .
this makes things easier , " explained bayern 's paulo sergio to the official uefa website .
" the more brazilians you have , the easier it is for them to adjust to german life .
as you see in dortmund they feel very good in their group , that 's why they settle so quickly . "
and settle they do , in increasing numbers .

bavaria 's high-flying it sector has earned the state the nickname as one of " laptops and lederhosen . "
but the german government is eager to prove the rest of germany is catching up . one of eastern germany 's most prestigious investment projects in the it sector , communicant semiconductors technologies , celebrated its cornerstone-laying ceremony on wednesday .
it comes as no surprise that education and research minister edelgard bulmahn stepped in for chancellor gerhard schröder , who had to cancel his visit to the ceremony to visit the flooded regions in eastern germany .
research development is of key interest to the federal government .
in communist east germany , frankfurt on the oder was a center for microelectronics .
but following german reunification , it could n't keep up with the competition from the west .
communicant wants to change that .
and it 's counting on support from berlin .
" this is a good day for the state of brandenburg , " said bulmahn , adding that communicant 's success was important for the federal government .

bavaria 's high-flying it sector has earned the state the nickname as one of " laptops and lederhosen . "
but the german government is eager to prove the rest of germany is catching up . one of eastern germany 's most prestigious investment projects in the it sector , communicant semiconductors technologies , celebrated its cornerstone-laying ceremony on wednesday .
it comes as no surprise that education and research minister edelgard bulmahn stepped in for chancellor gerhard schröder , who had to cancel his visit to the ceremony to visit the flooded regions in eastern germany .
research development is of key interest to the federal government .
in communist east germany , frankfurt on the oder was a center for microelectronics .
but following german reunification , it could n't keep up with the competition from the west .
communicant wants to change that .
and it 's counting on support from berlin .
" this is a good day for the state of brandenburg , " said bulmahn , adding that communicant 's success was important for the federal government .
the 1.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- factory will produce microchips and is expected to begin production in 2004 .
in addition to 1,500 people working at the facility itself , communicant said it anticipates 1,300 further jobs in the service and supply sectors - a welcome change in a region suffering from an unemployment rate of around 20 percent .
major investors are semiconductor giant intel and the emirate dubai .
but the federal government and the state of brandenburg will also contribute 320 million euro -lrb- $ 316 million -rrb- .
education and research for the future the social democratic-green coalition government in berlin has focused on promoting germany as a country geared for the future .
according to the ministry of education and research bmbf , germany has never invested more in education and research projects in its history .
since 1998 , the bmbf budget has jumped over 21 percent to 8.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 8.68 billion -rrb- .
the largest sum is devoted to the it sector .
over the past four years , financing for information technology has increased 13.6 percent to 279.5 million euro -lrb- $ 275.7 million -rrb- , bmbf said .
in 1999 , the bmbf , together with the federal economics ministry , also launched a five-year program called " innovation and jobs in the information society of the 21st century " .
its aims include improving access to new media , promoting multimedia in schools and boosting the it and communication sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn earlier this year , the government presented interim results - and hailed the program as a great success .
" germany is more future-oriented than ever before , " said bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- .
information and communication technologies sectors had developed into a leading economic sector , contributing to 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product .
also , e-commerce in germany was posting turnover of some 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.7 billion -rrb- , making it the number one in europe for this sector , the government said .
a downward trend in it the german association for information technology , telecommunications and new media , bitkom , welcomed the initiative .
" the federal government achieved its goal of giving significant impulses for a stronger and wider use of information and communication technology , " bitkom 's director general bernhard rohleder said in a statement .
internet access technology , in particular , had expanded .
but , he added , more needs to be done in the education system .
media competence should be integrated as a permanent component of teacher education .
further education in internet use should also be improved , rohleder said .
despite the efforts by the berlin government , the number of jobs in the it and telecommunications sector is declining - for the first time since the early 1990s .
according to bitkom , employment is down 3.4 percent to 791,000 jobs in 2002 .
producers of mobile phones and networks are slashing the most positions , the organization says .
but these cuts do not affect top positions .
" jobs are being cut almost exclusively in administration and distribution , " says stephan pfisterer of bitkom .
this includes many people who entered the it sector from other branches .
" but there is still a demand for it specialists with university degrees or many year 's experience , " he added .
laptops and lederhosen the true home of it in germany is the southern state of bavaria .
the state has introduced several successful programs to attract investors from the new economy sector .

at a time when european soccer is counting every euro cent and pence coin , the power previously in the hands of the players looks to be swinging back to the clubs . the financial bubble seems to have burst for european soccer and player power appears to be on the wane .
with clubs unable and unwilling to meet the sky-high transfer fees and personal demands of the world ’ s top stars , the question has reverted back from ‘ who can we afford to buy ? ’ to ‘ who has the desire to play ? ’
no longer is the discussion centred on the amount of zeroes on the wage slip .
recent reports document the increase in out-of-contract players appearing for nothing in a bid to get a job with cash-strapped clubs .

an annual budget of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- , a quarter of the money available over the past few years , means that clubs are less likely to make expensive forays into the transfer market and players wanting a move must show a willingness to compromise .

the money is there to bring brazilian stars to germany every top german club has at least two brazilians on their books and there are a total of 25 of them playing in the bundesliga 's top flight .
with brazilian players especially in vogue following the national team 's victory at this summer 's world cup , german teams are investing their hard-earned euros in south american talent .

has the green party found a new weapon against the conservative opposition ? the storms that have wreaked havoc in southern and eastern germany this past week have presented an unintended political opportunity for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government coallition .
lagging behind the christian democratic union and chrisitian social union in the polls before the sept .
22 elections , schröder ’ s social democratic and green party coalition government has used the flooding to tout their environmental record and attack the union ’ s lack of an environmental vision .
the greens took special issue with chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s failure to appoint a person responsible for environmental affairs in his much-publicised shadow cabinet .
" in the face of the ongoing natural catastrophe , candidate stoiber should reflect on why nobody in his so-called competence team is responsible for the environment , " green foreign minister joschka fischer told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper on tuesday .
" precisely in stoiber ’ s bavaria , there was unchecked construction in the flooded areas . "
weak spot in the opposition 's programme the political pressure on stoiber to think out a sound policy for the long-term consequences of climatic change is now growing .
on tuesday several spd and green politicians as well as representatives from environmental organisations called up stoiber to urge him to appoint an environmental expert in his cabinet .
a recent study by the german environmental ministry showing that just 25 percent of all german environmental activists are in favour of a cdu / csu coalition , has put more heat on stoiber to take action .
the environmental spokesperson of the greens , reinhard loske accused stoiber of " environmental ignorance " .
in a statement he said , " those such as the union who want to end the eco tax and reject the further expansion of renewable energies , are dealing in an utter irresponsible manner " .
a solid government record , say advocates the so-called “ eco tax ” is considered by advocates to be one of the great achievements of schröder ’ s coalition government since it came to power in 1998 .
the tax , placed on everything from fuel to electricity , is meant to spur conservation by gradually increasing the cost of energy and raw materials , kick-start investment aimed at energy conservation and generate revenues to bring down labour costs .
the red-green coalition added another environmental victory to its balance when in june 2000 it got the nuclear industry to agree on the phasing out of nuclear power in germany within the next 30 years .
the two proposals , celebrated by many in the international community , were viewed as a giant step towards achieving the german government ’ s objective of reducing co2 emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2005 .
both proposals have come under heavy criticism by industry leaders and opposition parties . business leaders felt the eco tax would scare away consumers fearing higher electricity bills and rising gasoline costs . opposition parties have maintained that nuclear energy is the most inexpensive form of energy currently available .
opposition still in favour of nuclear energy stoiber and the rest of the union have stuck to that message .
even in the face of the present catastrophe , a government led by the union parties will continue to rely on the entire spectrum of energy sources – even nuclear energy .
a hike in the ecological tax is also out of the question , said party officials .
" many people don ’ t like it when we say that we will use nuclear energy in the future .
but if we do away with nuclear energy , climate protection will become endlessly expensive , " klaus lippold , the party ’ s environmental expert and vice president of their parliamentary group , told the neue presse in hanover .
he said that the union will advocate " self-regulation on the part of the industry " to achieve climate protection goals .
meanwhile , as floods wreak havoc and claim lives in large regions of southern and eastern germany – particularly in saxony , saxony anhalt and bavaria – both chancellor schröder and his conservative challenger , stoiber have rushed to the worst-affected cities of dresden and passau in bavaria respectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly storms lash europe germany , the czech republic and austria were the hardest hit in the latest round of storms , which have claimed more than 70 lives across the continent in the past week .

“ we love that fascinating , lively , and sometimes difficult city , and its people .
we visit every year , and we continue to do so in the years to come . ” michael shulan , a new york writer who organized the exhibit with three photographer friends , said he was initially surprised by the great interest and resonance the show received abroad . in time , though , he has begun to see why . “ ground zero can stand for anywhere in the world , and this show is a presentation of people , reacting to things they don ’ t understand , and human emotion , ” he told dw-world .

the exhibition was an instant success , attracting more than 3 million visitors in new york alone since it opened last fall . now the exhibit is drawing similar crowds in berlin , where it kicked off a european tour in the historic martin gropius bau in early july . almost 50,000 visitors have flocked to the 500-photo show in its first few weeks – more than any other held in the museum in recent years , said arne mutert of the german interior ministry , which is co-sponsoring the german exhbitions together with the federal agency for civic education . the public 's to discuss munter said it was the show ’ s subtitle “ images of democracy ” that first caught the ministry ’ s attention . “ the most convincing argument for bringing the exhibition to berlin was its subtitle , ” mutert said in an interview with dw-world .
“ the show is a civic initative to cope with the events , and i think it 's very important that the discussion of september 11th is n't left up to the government .
if we want to come to terms with the event we need a broad civic discussion , and that ’ s what the exhibition does . ” visitors to “ here is new york , ” are allowed to formulate their own impressions and interpretations of the event , without the media ’ s filter , said mutert . “ it triggers discussion and gives motivation to rewrite the pictures in your head , giving you multiple perspectives , as opposed to the media ´ s 9/11 coverage , ” he said . berlin touch the berlin show has a home touch , an additional exhibition titled “ mein new york ” -lrb- my new york -rrb- , showcasing berliners ´ own pre-9/11 photos from ny , and their handwritten impressions , and feelings about the catastrophe . “ my husband worked from seven years on the wtc project as technical designer … new york was like our second home and the unthinkable catastrophe that has happened there , hurts us deeply , ” wrote mura grieius , of berlin , in the guest book laid out for the show .
“ we love that fascinating , lively , and sometimes difficult city , and its people .
we visit every year , and we continue to do so in the years to come . ” michael shulan , a new york writer who organized the exhibit with three photographer friends , said he was initially surprised by the great interest and resonance the show received abroad . in time , though , he has begun to see why . “ ground zero can stand for anywhere in the world , and this show is a presentation of people , reacting to things they don ’ t understand , and human emotion , ” he told dw-world .
“ 9/11 is only part of a larger story and now we understand this is only part of a larger problem . ” “ here is new york ” will also be presented in dresden , düsseldorf , stuttgart , and paris to mark the upcoming first anniversary of 9/11 .
the upcoming exhibition in washington d.c. will include photos of the pentagon , taken by official pentagon photographers , revealing an intimate view of the destruction . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the photo exhibit 's web site all of the collected “ here is new york ” photos can be viewed online .

has the green party found a new weapon against the conservative opposition ? the storms that have wreaked havoc in southern and eastern germany this past week have presented an unintended political opportunity for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government coallition .
lagging behind the christian democratic union and chrisitian social union in the polls before the sept .
22 elections , schröder ’ s social democratic and green party coalition government has used the flooding to tout their environmental record and attack the union ’ s lack of an environmental vision .
the greens took special issue with chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s failure to appoint a person responsible for environmental affairs in his much-publicised shadow cabinet .
" in the face of the ongoing natural catastrophe , candidate stoiber should reflect on why nobody in his so-called competence team is responsible for the environment , " green foreign minister joschka fischer told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper on tuesday .
" precisely in stoiber ’ s bavaria , there was unchecked construction in the flooded areas . "
weak spot in the opposition 's programme the political pressure on stoiber to think out a sound policy for the long-term consequences of climatic change is now growing .
on tuesday several spd and green politicians as well as representatives from environmental organisations called up stoiber to urge him to appoint an environmental expert in his cabinet .
a recent study by the german environmental ministry showing that just 25 percent of all german environmental activists are in favour of a cdu / csu coalition , has put more heat on stoiber to take action .
the environmental spokesperson of the greens , reinhard loske accused stoiber of " environmental ignorance " .
in a statement he said , " those such as the union who want to end the eco tax and reject the further expansion of renewable energies , are dealing in an utter irresponsible manner " .
a solid government record , say advocates the so-called “ eco tax ” is considered by advocates to be one of the great achievements of schröder ’ s coalition government since it came to power in 1998 .
the tax , placed on everything from fuel to electricity , is meant to spur conservation by gradually increasing the cost of energy and raw materials , kick-start investment aimed at energy conservation and generate revenues to bring down labour costs .
the red-green coalition added another environmental victory to its balance when in june 2000 it got the nuclear industry to agree on the phasing out of nuclear power in germany within the next 30 years .
the two proposals , celebrated by many in the international community , were viewed as a giant step towards achieving the german government ’ s objective of reducing co2 emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2005 .
both proposals have come under heavy criticism by industry leaders and opposition parties . business leaders felt the eco tax would scare away consumers fearing higher electricity bills and rising gasoline costs . opposition parties have maintained that nuclear energy is the most inexpensive form of energy currently available .
opposition still in favour of nuclear energy stoiber and the rest of the union have stuck to that message .
even in the face of the present catastrophe , a government led by the union parties will continue to rely on the entire spectrum of energy sources – even nuclear energy .
a hike in the ecological tax is also out of the question , said party officials .
" many people don ’ t like it when we say that we will use nuclear energy in the future .
but if we do away with nuclear energy , climate protection will become endlessly expensive , " klaus lippold , the party ’ s environmental expert and vice president of their parliamentary group , told the neue presse in hanover .
he said that the union will advocate " self-regulation on the part of the industry " to achieve climate protection goals .

the elbe river continued to swell , and officials in dresden worked into the night to move paintings , porcelain and other historical objects from basement storage rooms in the city 's baroque zwinger . as the clouds parted over central europe on thursday and the relentless rains gave way to summer sunshine , workers throughout the region were scrambling to save precious cultural treasures from rising flood waters . in the baroque city of dresden , government officials and volunteers worked into the night by candlelight at the dresden zwinger to carry paintings , porcelain and other historical objects to safety . the flooding hit much of central and eastern europe in the past days , leading to at least 85 deaths from the baltic to the black sea and to billions of euros worth of damage to crops , buildings and infrastructure . “ when i came to work on tuesday morning , no one realized that the situation would become so dramatic , ” helga puhlmann , spokeswoman for the city ’ s art collection told the berliner zeitung .
“ then suddenly , things got very serious . ” home of the " sistine madonna " dresden ’ s zwinger , a baroque palace , houses a porcelain collection , the collection of the mathematical-physical salon , the armoury museum and most importantly , the old masters art museum whose showpiece is raphael ’ s “ sistine madonna ” and whose collection includes many prominent works by veronese , tintoretto , correggio and annibale carracci .
it also houses paintings by van dyck , vermeer , dürer and rembrandt among others . by thursday , more than 4,000 paintings had been moved from basement storage rooms to safety on the upper floors . ground floor offices in the building – the most.famous late-baroque structure in germany – were evacuated .
the zwinger , whose name comes from a technical term from fortification design , was commissioned by august the strong , elector of saxony and also king of poland and was modeled after versailles . the first sections of the zwinger were completed in 1718 , the product of cooperation between the architect daniel pöppelmann and the sculptor balthasar permoser . zwinger was in ruins after world war ii like much of dresden , the zwinger was left in ruins after heavy american and british bombing at the end of world war ii .
it was partially reconstructed by the east german government prior to 1989 , and reconstruction efforts continued after german reunification . next door at the city ’ s nearly restored semper opera , firefighters were pumping floodwater from the basement in an effort to prevent further damage .
and workers at the city ’ s beloved frauenkirche -lrb- women ’ s church -rrb- , in the midst of a massive reconstruction project , were also feverishly pumping water , trying to prevent the basement flooding from moving upwards . experts warned , however , that flooding along the elbe river could grow worse as the torrents of the flooded czech vltava river pour into the elbe . flooding eases in prague after 200,000 evacuated the vltava river jumped its banks in prague on tuesday , and the swollen waters forced what czech officials said was the largest evacuation effort since world war ii .
more than 200,000 people have been moved from their homes this week . by midday thursday , officials said that the worst of the flooding in prague was over and that the water level was beginning to drop . the czech capital is normally packed with tourists at this time of the year .
a typical visit includes stops at the old town square , which features the city ’ s famous 15th century astronomical clock that stages a puppet showlike production when it chimes every hour ; the jewish quarter , which houses some of europe ’ s oldest synagogues and a historical jewish cemetery ; and the 14th century charles bridge . but on wednesday and thursday , the city ’ s historic downtown was nearly empty . czech officials said the old town area appeared to have escaped severe damaage . czech deputy culture minister zdenek novak told reuters : " there 's a lot we ca n't see right now because things are still under water .
we hope we do n't lose anything , but at this point , we just do n't know . " officials of the prague zoo , meanwhile , were searching for a seal that swam to freedom when the floodwaters made their way to the zoo .
earlier , an elephant and a hippopotamus had to be killed after flooding reached the zoo . the elephant became trapped in a flooded enclosure and officials said the animal could not be rescued .

it also houses paintings by van dyck , vermeer , dürer and rembrandt among others . by thursday , more than 4,000 paintings had been moved from basement storage rooms to safety on the upper floors . ground floor offices in the building – the most.famous late-baroque structure in germany – were evacuated .
the zwinger , whose name comes from a technical term from fortification design , was commissioned by august the strong , elector of saxony and also king of poland and was modeled after versailles . the first sections of the zwinger were completed in 1718 , the product of cooperation between the architect daniel pöppelmann and the sculptor balthasar permoser . zwinger was in ruins after world war ii like much of dresden , the zwinger was left in ruins after heavy american and british bombing at the end of world war ii .
it was partially reconstructed by the east german government prior to 1989 , and reconstruction efforts continued after german reunification . next door at the city ’ s nearly restored semper opera , firefighters were pumping floodwater from the basement in an effort to prevent further damage .
and workers at the city ’ s beloved frauenkirche -lrb- women ’ s church -rrb- , in the midst of a massive reconstruction project , were also feverishly pumping water , trying to prevent the basement flooding from moving upwards . experts warned , however , that flooding along the elbe river could grow worse as the torrents of the flooded czech vltava river pour into the elbe . flooding eases in prague after 200,000 evacuated the vltava river jumped its banks in prague on tuesday , and the swollen waters forced what czech officials said was the largest evacuation effort since world war ii .
more than 200,000 people have been moved from their homes this week . by midday thursday , officials said that the worst of the flooding in prague was over and that the water level was beginning to drop . the czech capital is normally packed with tourists at this time of the year .
a typical visit includes stops at the old town square , which features the city ’ s famous 15th century astronomical clock that stages a puppet showlike production when it chimes every hour ; the jewish quarter , which houses some of europe ’ s oldest synagogues and a historical jewish cemetery ; and the 14th century charles bridge . but on wednesday and thursday , the city ’ s historic downtown was nearly empty . czech officials said the old town area appeared to have escaped severe damaage . czech deputy culture minister zdenek novak told reuters : " there 's a lot we ca n't see right now because things are still under water .
we hope we do n't lose anything , but at this point , we just do n't know . " officials of the prague zoo , meanwhile , were searching for a seal that swam to freedom when the floodwaters made their way to the zoo .
earlier , an elephant and a hippopotamus had to be killed after flooding reached the zoo . the elephant became trapped in a flooded enclosure and officials said the animal could not be rescued .

at a time when european soccer is counting every euro cent and pence coin , the power previously in the hands of the players looks to be swinging back to the clubs . the financial bubble seems to have burst for european soccer and player power appears to be on the wane .
with clubs unable and unwilling to meet the sky-high transfer fees and personal demands of the world ’ s top stars , the question has reverted back from ‘ who can we afford to buy ? ’ to ‘ who has the desire to play ? ’
no longer is the discussion centred on the amount of zeroes on the wage slip .
recent reports document the increase in out-of-contract players appearing for nothing in a bid to get a job with cash-strapped clubs .
cash cow has been milked , clubs and players suffer lost revenue from television rights has meant capping of spiraling costs and in extreme cases , unemployment for players and closure for clubs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan effenberg headshot , as germany and bayern munich soccer player one high-profile casualty is former bayern munich captain and german national team player stefan effenberg .
priced out of a move to clubs in england and turkey , effenberg is looking at unemployment if he ca n't agree on a reduction of his superstar salary .
with the collapse of the kirchmedia empire in germany and english clubs left in limbo by the dissolved itvdigital company , the cash cow that provided the means for phenomenal weekly wages has been well and truly milked and put out to pasture .
despite financial problems , the european leagues are still the most attractive in the world .
the overwhelming popularity of the game , matched with the most high profile competitions still continue to bring foreign imports into the game .
the bundesliga continues to invest despite problems germany ’ s bundesliga is suffering as much as any .
an annual budget of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- , a quarter of the money available over the past few years , means that clubs are less likely to make expensive forays into the transfer market and players wanting a move must show a willingness to compromise .
however , a number of brazilian stars have persuaded clubs to brave the slump and are currently on show in the bundesliga this season , which kicked off last weekend .
the money is there to bring brazilian stars to germany every top german club has at least two brazilians on their books and there are a total of 25 of them playing in the bundesliga 's top flight .
with brazilian players especially in vogue following the national team 's victory at this summer 's world cup , german teams are investing their hard-earned euros in south american talent .
it seems the passion for the game and the need to compete at the highest level has brought stars from the world cup winning squad to german shores in search of a game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ze roberto moved to munich despite the current situation .
the current financial climate has n't stopped clubs like bayern munich spending 9.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.5 million euros -rrb- to take rival bayer leverkusen 's brazilian ze roberto to the olympiastadion to meet up with an expensive array of fellow countrymen .
a fellow south american in never far away " if a brazilian moves to a german club , he is likely to find a fellow countryman there .
this makes things easier , " explained bayern 's paulo sergio to the official uefa website .
" the more brazilians you have , the easier it is for them to adjust to german life .
as you see in dortmund they feel very good in their group , that 's why they settle so quickly . "
and settle they do , in increasing numbers .
although talk of crisis is rife throughout the game , football still appears to be rich enough to recruit the personnel the head coaches covet from around the globe .
it seems that some habits are very had to break . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga opens under clouds of scandal germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .

“ then suddenly , things got very serious . ” home of the " sistine madonna " dresden ’ s zwinger , a baroque palace , houses a porcelain collection , the collection of the mathematical-physical salon , the armoury museum and most importantly , the old masters art museum whose showpiece is raphael ’ s “ sistine madonna ” and whose collection includes many prominent works by veronese , tintoretto , correggio and annibale carracci .

it was partially reconstructed by the east german government prior to 1989 , and reconstruction efforts continued after german reunification . next door at the city ’ s nearly restored semper opera , firefighters were pumping floodwater from the basement in an effort to prevent further damage .
and workers at the city ’ s beloved frauenkirche -lrb- women ’ s church -rrb- , in the midst of a massive reconstruction project , were also feverishly pumping water , trying to prevent the basement flooding from moving upwards . experts warned , however , that flooding along the elbe river could grow worse as the torrents of the flooded czech vltava river pour into the elbe . flooding eases in prague after 200,000 evacuated the vltava river jumped its banks in prague on tuesday , and the swollen waters forced what czech officials said was the largest evacuation effort since world war ii .
more than 200,000 people have been moved from their homes this week . by midday thursday , officials said that the worst of the flooding in prague was over and that the water level was beginning to drop . the czech capital is normally packed with tourists at this time of the year .
a typical visit includes stops at the old town square , which features the city ’ s famous 15th century astronomical clock that stages a puppet showlike production when it chimes every hour ; the jewish quarter , which houses some of europe ’ s oldest synagogues and a historical jewish cemetery ; and the 14th century charles bridge . but on wednesday and thursday , the city ’ s historic downtown was nearly empty . czech officials said the old town area appeared to have escaped severe damaage . czech deputy culture minister zdenek novak told reuters : " there 's a lot we ca n't see right now because things are still under water .
we hope we do n't lose anything , but at this point , we just do n't know . " officials of the prague zoo , meanwhile , were searching for a seal that swam to freedom when the floodwaters made their way to the zoo .
earlier , an elephant and a hippopotamus had to be killed after flooding reached the zoo . the elephant became trapped in a flooded enclosure and officials said the animal could not be rescued .

with clubs unable and unwilling to meet the sky-high transfer fees and personal demands of the world ’ s top stars , the question has reverted back from ‘ who can we afford to buy ? ’ to ‘ who has the desire to play ? ’

the money is there to bring brazilian stars to germany every top german club has at least two brazilians on their books and there are a total of 25 of them playing in the bundesliga 's top flight .
with brazilian players especially in vogue following the national team 's victory at this summer 's world cup , german teams are investing their hard-earned euros in south american talent .

at a time when european soccer is counting every euro cent and pence coin , the power previously in the hands of the players looks to be swinging back to the clubs . the financial bubble seems to have burst for european soccer and player power appears to be on the wane .
with clubs unable and unwilling to meet the sky-high transfer fees and personal demands of the world ’ s top stars , the question has reverted back from ‘ who can we afford to buy ? ’ to ‘ who has the desire to play ? ’

at a time when european soccer is counting every euro cent and pence coin , the power previously in the hands of the players looks to be swinging back to the clubs . the financial bubble seems to have burst for european soccer and player power appears to be on the wane .
with clubs unable and unwilling to meet the sky-high transfer fees and personal demands of the world ’ s top stars , the question has reverted back from ‘ who can we afford to buy ? ’ to ‘ who has the desire to play ? ’
no longer is the discussion centred on the amount of zeroes on the wage slip .
recent reports document the increase in out-of-contract players appearing for nothing in a bid to get a job with cash-strapped clubs .
cash cow has been milked , clubs and players suffer lost revenue from television rights has meant capping of spiraling costs and in extreme cases , unemployment for players and closure for clubs .

priced out of a move to clubs in england and turkey , effenberg is looking at unemployment if he ca n't agree on a reduction of his superstar salary .
with the collapse of the kirchmedia empire in germany and english clubs left in limbo by the dissolved itvdigital company , the cash cow that provided the means for phenomenal weekly wages has been well and truly milked and put out to pasture .
despite financial problems , the european leagues are still the most attractive in the world .
the overwhelming popularity of the game , matched with the most high profile competitions still continue to bring foreign imports into the game .
the bundesliga continues to invest despite problems germany ’ s bundesliga is suffering as much as any .
an annual budget of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- , a quarter of the money available over the past few years , means that clubs are less likely to make expensive forays into the transfer market and players wanting a move must show a willingness to compromise .
however , a number of brazilian stars have persuaded clubs to brave the slump and are currently on show in the bundesliga this season , which kicked off last weekend .
the money is there to bring brazilian stars to germany every top german club has at least two brazilians on their books and there are a total of 25 of them playing in the bundesliga 's top flight .
with brazilian players especially in vogue following the national team 's victory at this summer 's world cup , german teams are investing their hard-earned euros in south american talent .
it seems the passion for the game and the need to compete at the highest level has brought stars from the world cup winning squad to german shores in search of a game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ze roberto moved to munich despite the current situation .
the current financial climate has n't stopped clubs like bayern munich spending 9.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.5 million euros -rrb- to take rival bayer leverkusen 's brazilian ze roberto to the olympiastadion to meet up with an expensive array of fellow countrymen .

" the more brazilians you have , the easier it is for them to adjust to german life .
as you see in dortmund they feel very good in their group , that 's why they settle so quickly . "

has the green party found a new weapon against the conservative opposition ? the storms that have wreaked havoc in southern and eastern germany this past week have presented an unintended political opportunity for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government coallition .
lagging behind the christian democratic union and chrisitian social union in the polls before the sept .
22 elections , schröder ’ s social democratic and green party coalition government has used the flooding to tout their environmental record and attack the union ’ s lack of an environmental vision .
the greens took special issue with chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s failure to appoint a person responsible for environmental affairs in his much-publicised shadow cabinet .
" in the face of the ongoing natural catastrophe , candidate stoiber should reflect on why nobody in his so-called competence team is responsible for the environment , " green foreign minister joschka fischer told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper on tuesday .
" precisely in stoiber ’ s bavaria , there was unchecked construction in the flooded areas . "
weak spot in the opposition 's programme the political pressure on stoiber to think out a sound policy for the long-term consequences of climatic change is now growing .
on tuesday several spd and green politicians as well as representatives from environmental organisations called up stoiber to urge him to appoint an environmental expert in his cabinet .
a recent study by the german environmental ministry showing that just 25 percent of all german environmental activists are in favour of a cdu / csu coalition , has put more heat on stoiber to take action .
the environmental spokesperson of the greens , reinhard loske accused stoiber of " environmental ignorance " .
in a statement he said , " those such as the union who want to end the eco tax and reject the further expansion of renewable energies , are dealing in an utter irresponsible manner " .
a solid government record , say advocates the so-called “ eco tax ” is considered by advocates to be one of the great achievements of schröder ’ s coalition government since it came to power in 1998 .
the tax , placed on everything from fuel to electricity , is meant to spur conservation by gradually increasing the cost of energy and raw materials , kick-start investment aimed at energy conservation and generate revenues to bring down labour costs .
the red-green coalition added another environmental victory to its balance when in june 2000 it got the nuclear industry to agree on the phasing out of nuclear power in germany within the next 30 years .
the two proposals , celebrated by many in the international community , were viewed as a giant step towards achieving the german government ’ s objective of reducing co2 emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2005 .
both proposals have come under heavy criticism by industry leaders and opposition parties . business leaders felt the eco tax would scare away consumers fearing higher electricity bills and rising gasoline costs . opposition parties have maintained that nuclear energy is the most inexpensive form of energy currently available .
opposition still in favour of nuclear energy stoiber and the rest of the union have stuck to that message .
even in the face of the present catastrophe , a government led by the union parties will continue to rely on the entire spectrum of energy sources – even nuclear energy .
a hike in the ecological tax is also out of the question , said party officials .
" many people don ’ t like it when we say that we will use nuclear energy in the future .
but if we do away with nuclear energy , climate protection will become endlessly expensive , " klaus lippold , the party ’ s environmental expert and vice president of their parliamentary group , told the neue presse in hanover .
he said that the union will advocate " self-regulation on the part of the industry " to achieve climate protection goals .

lagging behind the christian democratic union and chrisitian social union in the polls before the sept .
22 elections , schröder ’ s social democratic and green party coalition government has used the flooding to tout their environmental record and attack the union ’ s lack of an environmental vision .
the greens took special issue with chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s failure to appoint a person responsible for environmental affairs in his much-publicised shadow cabinet .
" in the face of the ongoing natural catastrophe , candidate stoiber should reflect on why nobody in his so-called competence team is responsible for the environment , " green foreign minister joschka fischer told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper on tuesday .
" precisely in stoiber ’ s bavaria , there was unchecked construction in the flooded areas . "
weak spot in the opposition 's programme the political pressure on stoiber to think out a sound policy for the long-term consequences of climatic change is now growing .
on tuesday several spd and green politicians as well as representatives from environmental organisations called up stoiber to urge him to appoint an environmental expert in his cabinet .
a recent study by the german environmental ministry showing that just 25 percent of all german environmental activists are in favour of a cdu / csu coalition , has put more heat on stoiber to take action .
the environmental spokesperson of the greens , reinhard loske accused stoiber of " environmental ignorance " .
in a statement he said , " those such as the union who want to end the eco tax and reject the further expansion of renewable energies , are dealing in an utter irresponsible manner " .
a solid government record , say advocates the so-called “ eco tax ” is considered by advocates to be one of the great achievements of schröder ’ s coalition government since it came to power in 1998 .
the tax , placed on everything from fuel to electricity , is meant to spur conservation by gradually increasing the cost of energy and raw materials , kick-start investment aimed at energy conservation and generate revenues to bring down labour costs .
the red-green coalition added another environmental victory to its balance when in june 2000 it got the nuclear industry to agree on the phasing out of nuclear power in germany within the next 30 years .
the two proposals , celebrated by many in the international community , were viewed as a giant step towards achieving the german government ’ s objective of reducing co2 emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2005 .
both proposals have come under heavy criticism by industry leaders and opposition parties . business leaders felt the eco tax would scare away consumers fearing higher electricity bills and rising gasoline costs . opposition parties have maintained that nuclear energy is the most inexpensive form of energy currently available .
opposition still in favour of nuclear energy stoiber and the rest of the union have stuck to that message .
even in the face of the present catastrophe , a government led by the union parties will continue to rely on the entire spectrum of energy sources – even nuclear energy .
a hike in the ecological tax is also out of the question , said party officials .
" many people don ’ t like it when we say that we will use nuclear energy in the future .
but if we do away with nuclear energy , climate protection will become endlessly expensive , " klaus lippold , the party ’ s environmental expert and vice president of their parliamentary group , told the neue presse in hanover .
he said that the union will advocate " self-regulation on the part of the industry " to achieve climate protection goals .

11 shows just how traumatic the attacks have been for the rest of the world . before the ash and soot of the burning wtc towers had settled , the “ here is new york ” exhibition had already opened up - just a few blocks from ground zero . what started as a spontaneous compilation of 100 photos has grown into a collection of more than 10,000 prints by both professional and amateur photographers .
the exhibition was an instant success , attracting more than 3 million visitors in new york alone since it opened last fall . now the exhibit is drawing similar crowds in berlin , where it kicked off a european tour in the historic martin gropius bau in early july . almost 50,000 visitors have flocked to the 500-photo show in its first few weeks – more than any other held in the museum in recent years , said arne mutert of the german interior ministry , which is co-sponsoring the german exhbitions together with the federal agency for civic education . the public 's to discuss munter said it was the show ’ s subtitle “ images of democracy ” that first caught the ministry ’ s attention . “ the most convincing argument for bringing the exhibition to berlin was its subtitle , ” mutert said in an interview with dw-world .

“ we love that fascinating , lively , and sometimes difficult city , and its people .
we visit every year , and we continue to do so in the years to come . ” michael shulan , a new york writer who organized the exhibit with three photographer friends , said he was initially surprised by the great interest and resonance the show received abroad . in time , though , he has begun to see why . “ ground zero can stand for anywhere in the world , and this show is a presentation of people , reacting to things they don ’ t understand , and human emotion , ” he told dw-world .

the elbe river continued to swell , and officials in dresden worked into the night to move paintings , porcelain and other historical objects from basement storage rooms in the city 's baroque zwinger . as the clouds parted over central europe on thursday and the relentless rains gave way to summer sunshine , workers throughout the region were scrambling to save precious cultural treasures from rising flood waters . in the baroque city of dresden , government officials and volunteers worked into the night by candlelight at the dresden zwinger to carry paintings , porcelain and other historical objects to safety . the flooding hit much of central and eastern europe in the past days , leading to at least 85 deaths from the baltic to the black sea and to billions of euros worth of damage to crops , buildings and infrastructure . “ when i came to work on tuesday morning , no one realized that the situation would become so dramatic , ” helga puhlmann , spokeswoman for the city ’ s art collection told the berliner zeitung .
“ then suddenly , things got very serious . ” home of the " sistine madonna " dresden ’ s zwinger , a baroque palace , houses a porcelain collection , the collection of the mathematical-physical salon , the armoury museum and most importantly , the old masters art museum whose showpiece is raphael ’ s “ sistine madonna ” and whose collection includes many prominent works by veronese , tintoretto , correggio and annibale carracci .
it also houses paintings by van dyck , vermeer , dürer and rembrandt among others . by thursday , more than 4,000 paintings had been moved from basement storage rooms to safety on the upper floors . ground floor offices in the building – the most.famous late-baroque structure in germany – were evacuated .
the zwinger , whose name comes from a technical term from fortification design , was commissioned by august the strong , elector of saxony and also king of poland and was modeled after versailles . the first sections of the zwinger were completed in 1718 , the product of cooperation between the architect daniel pöppelmann and the sculptor balthasar permoser . zwinger was in ruins after world war ii like much of dresden , the zwinger was left in ruins after heavy american and british bombing at the end of world war ii .
it was partially reconstructed by the east german government prior to 1989 , and reconstruction efforts continued after german reunification . next door at the city ’ s nearly restored semper opera , firefighters were pumping floodwater from the basement in an effort to prevent further damage .
and workers at the city ’ s beloved frauenkirche -lrb- women ’ s church -rrb- , in the midst of a massive reconstruction project , were also feverishly pumping water , trying to prevent the basement flooding from moving upwards . experts warned , however , that flooding along the elbe river could grow worse as the torrents of the flooded czech vltava river pour into the elbe . flooding eases in prague after 200,000 evacuated the vltava river jumped its banks in prague on tuesday , and the swollen waters forced what czech officials said was the largest evacuation effort since world war ii .
more than 200,000 people have been moved from their homes this week . by midday thursday , officials said that the worst of the flooding in prague was over and that the water level was beginning to drop . the czech capital is normally packed with tourists at this time of the year .
a typical visit includes stops at the old town square , which features the city ’ s famous 15th century astronomical clock that stages a puppet showlike production when it chimes every hour ; the jewish quarter , which houses some of europe ’ s oldest synagogues and a historical jewish cemetery ; and the 14th century charles bridge . but on wednesday and thursday , the city ’ s historic downtown was nearly empty . czech officials said the old town area appeared to have escaped severe damaage . czech deputy culture minister zdenek novak told reuters : " there 's a lot we ca n't see right now because things are still under water .
we hope we do n't lose anything , but at this point , we just do n't know . " officials of the prague zoo , meanwhile , were searching for a seal that swam to freedom when the floodwaters made their way to the zoo .
earlier , an elephant and a hippopotamus had to be killed after flooding reached the zoo . the elephant became trapped in a flooded enclosure and officials said the animal could not be rescued .
the hippo escaped from its cage and became so aggressive that zookeepers decided to put it down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deadly storms lash europe germany , the czech republic and austria were the hardest hit in the latest round of storms , which have claimed more than 70 lives across the continent in the past week .

bavaria 's high-flying it sector has earned the state the nickname as one of " laptops and lederhosen . "
but the german government is eager to prove the rest of germany is catching up . one of eastern germany 's most prestigious investment projects in the it sector , communicant semiconductors technologies , celebrated its cornerstone-laying ceremony on wednesday .
it comes as no surprise that education and research minister edelgard bulmahn stepped in for chancellor gerhard schröder , who had to cancel his visit to the ceremony to visit the flooded regions in eastern germany .
research development is of key interest to the federal government .
in communist east germany , frankfurt on the oder was a center for microelectronics .
but following german reunification , it could n't keep up with the competition from the west .
communicant wants to change that .
and it 's counting on support from berlin .
" this is a good day for the state of brandenburg , " said bulmahn , adding that communicant 's success was important for the federal government .
the 1.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- factory will produce microchips and is expected to begin production in 2004 .
in addition to 1,500 people working at the facility itself , communicant said it anticipates 1,300 further jobs in the service and supply sectors - a welcome change in a region suffering from an unemployment rate of around 20 percent .
major investors are semiconductor giant intel and the emirate dubai .

at a time when european soccer is counting every euro cent and pence coin , the power previously in the hands of the players looks to be swinging back to the clubs . the financial bubble seems to have burst for european soccer and player power appears to be on the wane .
with clubs unable and unwilling to meet the sky-high transfer fees and personal demands of the world ’ s top stars , the question has reverted back from ‘ who can we afford to buy ? ’ to ‘ who has the desire to play ? ’
no longer is the discussion centred on the amount of zeroes on the wage slip .
recent reports document the increase in out-of-contract players appearing for nothing in a bid to get a job with cash-strapped clubs .
cash cow has been milked , clubs and players suffer lost revenue from television rights has meant capping of spiraling costs and in extreme cases , unemployment for players and closure for clubs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan effenberg headshot , as germany and bayern munich soccer player one high-profile casualty is former bayern munich captain and german national team player stefan effenberg .
priced out of a move to clubs in england and turkey , effenberg is looking at unemployment if he ca n't agree on a reduction of his superstar salary .
with the collapse of the kirchmedia empire in germany and english clubs left in limbo by the dissolved itvdigital company , the cash cow that provided the means for phenomenal weekly wages has been well and truly milked and put out to pasture .
despite financial problems , the european leagues are still the most attractive in the world .
the overwhelming popularity of the game , matched with the most high profile competitions still continue to bring foreign imports into the game .
the bundesliga continues to invest despite problems germany ’ s bundesliga is suffering as much as any .
an annual budget of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- , a quarter of the money available over the past few years , means that clubs are less likely to make expensive forays into the transfer market and players wanting a move must show a willingness to compromise .
however , a number of brazilian stars have persuaded clubs to brave the slump and are currently on show in the bundesliga this season , which kicked off last weekend .
the money is there to bring brazilian stars to germany every top german club has at least two brazilians on their books and there are a total of 25 of them playing in the bundesliga 's top flight .
with brazilian players especially in vogue following the national team 's victory at this summer 's world cup , german teams are investing their hard-earned euros in south american talent .
it seems the passion for the game and the need to compete at the highest level has brought stars from the world cup winning squad to german shores in search of a game .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ze roberto moved to munich despite the current situation .
the current financial climate has n't stopped clubs like bayern munich spending 9.5 million euros -lrb- $ 9.5 million euros -rrb- to take rival bayer leverkusen 's brazilian ze roberto to the olympiastadion to meet up with an expensive array of fellow countrymen .
a fellow south american in never far away " if a brazilian moves to a german club , he is likely to find a fellow countryman there .
this makes things easier , " explained bayern 's paulo sergio to the official uefa website .
" the more brazilians you have , the easier it is for them to adjust to german life .
as you see in dortmund they feel very good in their group , that 's why they settle so quickly . "
and settle they do , in increasing numbers .
although talk of crisis is rife throughout the game , football still appears to be rich enough to recruit the personnel the head coaches covet from around the globe .

bavaria 's high-flying it sector has earned the state the nickname as one of " laptops and lederhosen . "
but the german government is eager to prove the rest of germany is catching up . one of eastern germany 's most prestigious investment projects in the it sector , communicant semiconductors technologies , celebrated its cornerstone-laying ceremony on wednesday .
it comes as no surprise that education and research minister edelgard bulmahn stepped in for chancellor gerhard schröder , who had to cancel his visit to the ceremony to visit the flooded regions in eastern germany .
research development is of key interest to the federal government .
in communist east germany , frankfurt on the oder was a center for microelectronics .
but following german reunification , it could n't keep up with the competition from the west .
communicant wants to change that .
and it 's counting on support from berlin .
" this is a good day for the state of brandenburg , " said bulmahn , adding that communicant 's success was important for the federal government .
the 1.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- factory will produce microchips and is expected to begin production in 2004 .
in addition to 1,500 people working at the facility itself , communicant said it anticipates 1,300 further jobs in the service and supply sectors - a welcome change in a region suffering from an unemployment rate of around 20 percent .
major investors are semiconductor giant intel and the emirate dubai .
but the federal government and the state of brandenburg will also contribute 320 million euro -lrb- $ 316 million -rrb- .
education and research for the future the social democratic-green coalition government in berlin has focused on promoting germany as a country geared for the future .
according to the ministry of education and research bmbf , germany has never invested more in education and research projects in its history .
since 1998 , the bmbf budget has jumped over 21 percent to 8.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 8.68 billion -rrb- .

bavaria 's high-flying it sector has earned the state the nickname as one of " laptops and lederhosen . "
but the german government is eager to prove the rest of germany is catching up . one of eastern germany 's most prestigious investment projects in the it sector , communicant semiconductors technologies , celebrated its cornerstone-laying ceremony on wednesday .
it comes as no surprise that education and research minister edelgard bulmahn stepped in for chancellor gerhard schröder , who had to cancel his visit to the ceremony to visit the flooded regions in eastern germany .
research development is of key interest to the federal government .
in communist east germany , frankfurt on the oder was a center for microelectronics .
but following german reunification , it could n't keep up with the competition from the west .
communicant wants to change that .
and it 's counting on support from berlin .
" this is a good day for the state of brandenburg , " said bulmahn , adding that communicant 's success was important for the federal government .
the 1.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- factory will produce microchips and is expected to begin production in 2004 .
in addition to 1,500 people working at the facility itself , communicant said it anticipates 1,300 further jobs in the service and supply sectors - a welcome change in a region suffering from an unemployment rate of around 20 percent .
major investors are semiconductor giant intel and the emirate dubai .
but the federal government and the state of brandenburg will also contribute 320 million euro -lrb- $ 316 million -rrb- .
education and research for the future the social democratic-green coalition government in berlin has focused on promoting germany as a country geared for the future .
according to the ministry of education and research bmbf , germany has never invested more in education and research projects in its history .
since 1998 , the bmbf budget has jumped over 21 percent to 8.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 8.68 billion -rrb- .
the largest sum is devoted to the it sector .
over the past four years , financing for information technology has increased 13.6 percent to 279.5 million euro -lrb- $ 275.7 million -rrb- , bmbf said .
in 1999 , the bmbf , together with the federal economics ministry , also launched a five-year program called " innovation and jobs in the information society of the 21st century " .
its aims include improving access to new media , promoting multimedia in schools and boosting the it and communication sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn earlier this year , the government presented interim results - and hailed the program as a great success .
" germany is more future-oriented than ever before , " said bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- .
information and communication technologies sectors had developed into a leading economic sector , contributing to 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product .
also , e-commerce in germany was posting turnover of some 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.7 billion -rrb- , making it the number one in europe for this sector , the government said .
a downward trend in it the german association for information technology , telecommunications and new media , bitkom , welcomed the initiative .
" the federal government achieved its goal of giving significant impulses for a stronger and wider use of information and communication technology , " bitkom 's director general bernhard rohleder said in a statement .
internet access technology , in particular , had expanded .
but , he added , more needs to be done in the education system .
media competence should be integrated as a permanent component of teacher education .
further education in internet use should also be improved , rohleder said .
despite the efforts by the berlin government , the number of jobs in the it and telecommunications sector is declining - for the first time since the early 1990s .
according to bitkom , employment is down 3.4 percent to 791,000 jobs in 2002 .
producers of mobile phones and networks are slashing the most positions , the organization says .
but these cuts do not affect top positions .
" jobs are being cut almost exclusively in administration and distribution , " says stephan pfisterer of bitkom .
this includes many people who entered the it sector from other branches .
" but there is still a demand for it specialists with university degrees or many year 's experience , " he added .

has the green party found a new weapon against the conservative opposition ? the storms that have wreaked havoc in southern and eastern germany this past week have presented an unintended political opportunity for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government coallition .
lagging behind the christian democratic union and chrisitian social union in the polls before the sept .
22 elections , schröder ’ s social democratic and green party coalition government has used the flooding to tout their environmental record and attack the union ’ s lack of an environmental vision .
the greens took special issue with chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s failure to appoint a person responsible for environmental affairs in his much-publicised shadow cabinet .
" in the face of the ongoing natural catastrophe , candidate stoiber should reflect on why nobody in his so-called competence team is responsible for the environment , " green foreign minister joschka fischer told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper on tuesday .
" precisely in stoiber ’ s bavaria , there was unchecked construction in the flooded areas . "
weak spot in the opposition 's programme the political pressure on stoiber to think out a sound policy for the long-term consequences of climatic change is now growing .
on tuesday several spd and green politicians as well as representatives from environmental organisations called up stoiber to urge him to appoint an environmental expert in his cabinet .
a recent study by the german environmental ministry showing that just 25 percent of all german environmental activists are in favour of a cdu / csu coalition , has put more heat on stoiber to take action .
the environmental spokesperson of the greens , reinhard loske accused stoiber of " environmental ignorance " .
in a statement he said , " those such as the union who want to end the eco tax and reject the further expansion of renewable energies , are dealing in an utter irresponsible manner " .
a solid government record , say advocates the so-called “ eco tax ” is considered by advocates to be one of the great achievements of schröder ’ s coalition government since it came to power in 1998 .
the tax , placed on everything from fuel to electricity , is meant to spur conservation by gradually increasing the cost of energy and raw materials , kick-start investment aimed at energy conservation and generate revenues to bring down labour costs .
the red-green coalition added another environmental victory to its balance when in june 2000 it got the nuclear industry to agree on the phasing out of nuclear power in germany within the next 30 years .
the two proposals , celebrated by many in the international community , were viewed as a giant step towards achieving the german government ’ s objective of reducing co2 emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2005 .
both proposals have come under heavy criticism by industry leaders and opposition parties . business leaders felt the eco tax would scare away consumers fearing higher electricity bills and rising gasoline costs . opposition parties have maintained that nuclear energy is the most inexpensive form of energy currently available .
opposition still in favour of nuclear energy stoiber and the rest of the union have stuck to that message .
even in the face of the present catastrophe , a government led by the union parties will continue to rely on the entire spectrum of energy sources – even nuclear energy .
a hike in the ecological tax is also out of the question , said party officials .
" many people don ’ t like it when we say that we will use nuclear energy in the future .
but if we do away with nuclear energy , climate protection will become endlessly expensive , " klaus lippold , the party ’ s environmental expert and vice president of their parliamentary group , told the neue presse in hanover .
he said that the union will advocate " self-regulation on the part of the industry " to achieve climate protection goals .

the elbe river continued to swell , and officials in dresden worked into the night to move paintings , porcelain and other historical objects from basement storage rooms in the city 's baroque zwinger . as the clouds parted over central europe on thursday and the relentless rains gave way to summer sunshine , workers throughout the region were scrambling to save precious cultural treasures from rising flood waters . in the baroque city of dresden , government officials and volunteers worked into the night by candlelight at the dresden zwinger to carry paintings , porcelain and other historical objects to safety . the flooding hit much of central and eastern europe in the past days , leading to at least 85 deaths from the baltic to the black sea and to billions of euros worth of damage to crops , buildings and infrastructure . “ when i came to work on tuesday morning , no one realized that the situation would become so dramatic , ” helga puhlmann , spokeswoman for the city ’ s art collection told the berliner zeitung .
“ then suddenly , things got very serious . ” home of the " sistine madonna " dresden ’ s zwinger , a baroque palace , houses a porcelain collection , the collection of the mathematical-physical salon , the armoury museum and most importantly , the old masters art museum whose showpiece is raphael ’ s “ sistine madonna ” and whose collection includes many prominent works by veronese , tintoretto , correggio and annibale carracci .
it also houses paintings by van dyck , vermeer , dürer and rembrandt among others . by thursday , more than 4,000 paintings had been moved from basement storage rooms to safety on the upper floors . ground floor offices in the building – the most.famous late-baroque structure in germany – were evacuated .

at a time when european soccer is counting every euro cent and pence coin , the power previously in the hands of the players looks to be swinging back to the clubs . the financial bubble seems to have burst for european soccer and player power appears to be on the wane .
with clubs unable and unwilling to meet the sky-high transfer fees and personal demands of the world ’ s top stars , the question has reverted back from ‘ who can we afford to buy ? ’ to ‘ who has the desire to play ? ’
no longer is the discussion centred on the amount of zeroes on the wage slip .
recent reports document the increase in out-of-contract players appearing for nothing in a bid to get a job with cash-strapped clubs .
cash cow has been milked , clubs and players suffer lost revenue from television rights has meant capping of spiraling costs and in extreme cases , unemployment for players and closure for clubs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan effenberg headshot , as germany and bayern munich soccer player one high-profile casualty is former bayern munich captain and german national team player stefan effenberg .
priced out of a move to clubs in england and turkey , effenberg is looking at unemployment if he ca n't agree on a reduction of his superstar salary .
with the collapse of the kirchmedia empire in germany and english clubs left in limbo by the dissolved itvdigital company , the cash cow that provided the means for phenomenal weekly wages has been well and truly milked and put out to pasture .
despite financial problems , the european leagues are still the most attractive in the world .
the overwhelming popularity of the game , matched with the most high profile competitions still continue to bring foreign imports into the game .
the bundesliga continues to invest despite problems germany ’ s bundesliga is suffering as much as any .
an annual budget of 100 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- , a quarter of the money available over the past few years , means that clubs are less likely to make expensive forays into the transfer market and players wanting a move must show a willingness to compromise .

bavaria 's high-flying it sector has earned the state the nickname as one of " laptops and lederhosen . "
but the german government is eager to prove the rest of germany is catching up . one of eastern germany 's most prestigious investment projects in the it sector , communicant semiconductors technologies , celebrated its cornerstone-laying ceremony on wednesday .
it comes as no surprise that education and research minister edelgard bulmahn stepped in for chancellor gerhard schröder , who had to cancel his visit to the ceremony to visit the flooded regions in eastern germany .
research development is of key interest to the federal government .
in communist east germany , frankfurt on the oder was a center for microelectronics .
but following german reunification , it could n't keep up with the competition from the west .
communicant wants to change that .
and it 's counting on support from berlin .
" this is a good day for the state of brandenburg , " said bulmahn , adding that communicant 's success was important for the federal government .
the 1.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- factory will produce microchips and is expected to begin production in 2004 .
in addition to 1,500 people working at the facility itself , communicant said it anticipates 1,300 further jobs in the service and supply sectors - a welcome change in a region suffering from an unemployment rate of around 20 percent .
major investors are semiconductor giant intel and the emirate dubai .
but the federal government and the state of brandenburg will also contribute 320 million euro -lrb- $ 316 million -rrb- .
education and research for the future the social democratic-green coalition government in berlin has focused on promoting germany as a country geared for the future .
according to the ministry of education and research bmbf , germany has never invested more in education and research projects in its history .
since 1998 , the bmbf budget has jumped over 21 percent to 8.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 8.68 billion -rrb- .
the largest sum is devoted to the it sector .
over the past four years , financing for information technology has increased 13.6 percent to 279.5 million euro -lrb- $ 275.7 million -rrb- , bmbf said .
in 1999 , the bmbf , together with the federal economics ministry , also launched a five-year program called " innovation and jobs in the information society of the 21st century " .
its aims include improving access to new media , promoting multimedia in schools and boosting the it and communication sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn earlier this year , the government presented interim results - and hailed the program as a great success .
" germany is more future-oriented than ever before , " said bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- .
information and communication technologies sectors had developed into a leading economic sector , contributing to 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product .
also , e-commerce in germany was posting turnover of some 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.7 billion -rrb- , making it the number one in europe for this sector , the government said .
a downward trend in it the german association for information technology , telecommunications and new media , bitkom , welcomed the initiative .
" the federal government achieved its goal of giving significant impulses for a stronger and wider use of information and communication technology , " bitkom 's director general bernhard rohleder said in a statement .
internet access technology , in particular , had expanded .
but , he added , more needs to be done in the education system .
media competence should be integrated as a permanent component of teacher education .
further education in internet use should also be improved , rohleder said .
despite the efforts by the berlin government , the number of jobs in the it and telecommunications sector is declining - for the first time since the early 1990s .
according to bitkom , employment is down 3.4 percent to 791,000 jobs in 2002 .
producers of mobile phones and networks are slashing the most positions , the organization says .
but these cuts do not affect top positions .
" jobs are being cut almost exclusively in administration and distribution , " says stephan pfisterer of bitkom .
this includes many people who entered the it sector from other branches .
" but there is still a demand for it specialists with university degrees or many year 's experience , " he added .
laptops and lederhosen the true home of it in germany is the southern state of bavaria .
the state has introduced several successful programs to attract investors from the new economy sector .
apple , cisco , compaq , microsoft , oracle and sun microsystems are just a few of the companies that have their european or german headquarters in bavaria .
prime minister edmund stoiber , who is the opposition candidate for chancellor in the upcoming federal elections , is making no secret of this success story .
unemployment in bavaria is almost half the national average while it leads the country in per capita income .
the transition from an agricultural state 50 years ago to the " high-tech mecca " of europe , as microsoft founder bill gates has called bavaria , is no accident .
" to help bavaria stay in the fast lane , the state has divested itself of several industries and reinvested the proceeds from privatization amounting to some $ 4 billion in a massive program called ' future initiative bavaria ' , " said minister erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery , in a statement . " this program is used to finance investments in the industrial and scientific infrastructure , " huber said .
" with a view to consolidating and further enhancing bavaria 's top position as a leading high-tech region in europe .

and it 's counting on support from berlin .
" this is a good day for the state of brandenburg , " said bulmahn , adding that communicant 's success was important for the federal government .
the 1.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- factory will produce microchips and is expected to begin production in 2004 .
in addition to 1,500 people working at the facility itself , communicant said it anticipates 1,300 further jobs in the service and supply sectors - a welcome change in a region suffering from an unemployment rate of around 20 percent .
major investors are semiconductor giant intel and the emirate dubai .
but the federal government and the state of brandenburg will also contribute 320 million euro -lrb- $ 316 million -rrb- .
education and research for the future the social democratic-green coalition government in berlin has focused on promoting germany as a country geared for the future .
according to the ministry of education and research bmbf , germany has never invested more in education and research projects in its history .
since 1998 , the bmbf budget has jumped over 21 percent to 8.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 8.68 billion -rrb- .
the largest sum is devoted to the it sector .
over the past four years , financing for information technology has increased 13.6 percent to 279.5 million euro -lrb- $ 275.7 million -rrb- , bmbf said .
in 1999 , the bmbf , together with the federal economics ministry , also launched a five-year program called " innovation and jobs in the information society of the 21st century " .
its aims include improving access to new media , promoting multimedia in schools and boosting the it and communication sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn earlier this year , the government presented interim results - and hailed the program as a great success .
" germany is more future-oriented than ever before , " said bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- .
information and communication technologies sectors had developed into a leading economic sector , contributing to 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product .
also , e-commerce in germany was posting turnover of some 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.7 billion -rrb- , making it the number one in europe for this sector , the government said .
a downward trend in it the german association for information technology , telecommunications and new media , bitkom , welcomed the initiative .
" the federal government achieved its goal of giving significant impulses for a stronger and wider use of information and communication technology , " bitkom 's director general bernhard rohleder said in a statement .
internet access technology , in particular , had expanded .
but , he added , more needs to be done in the education system .
media competence should be integrated as a permanent component of teacher education .
further education in internet use should also be improved , rohleder said .
despite the efforts by the berlin government , the number of jobs in the it and telecommunications sector is declining - for the first time since the early 1990s .
according to bitkom , employment is down 3.4 percent to 791,000 jobs in 2002 .
producers of mobile phones and networks are slashing the most positions , the organization says .
but these cuts do not affect top positions .
" jobs are being cut almost exclusively in administration and distribution , " says stephan pfisterer of bitkom .
this includes many people who entered the it sector from other branches .
" but there is still a demand for it specialists with university degrees or many year 's experience , " he added .

the state has introduced several successful programs to attract investors from the new economy sector .
apple , cisco , compaq , microsoft , oracle and sun microsystems are just a few of the companies that have their european or german headquarters in bavaria .
prime minister edmund stoiber , who is the opposition candidate for chancellor in the upcoming federal elections , is making no secret of this success story .
unemployment in bavaria is almost half the national average while it leads the country in per capita income .
the transition from an agricultural state 50 years ago to the " high-tech mecca " of europe , as microsoft founder bill gates has called bavaria , is no accident .
" to help bavaria stay in the fast lane , the state has divested itself of several industries and reinvested the proceeds from privatization amounting to some $ 4 billion in a massive program called ' future initiative bavaria ' , " said minister erwin huber , head of the bavarian state chancellery , in a statement . " this program is used to finance investments in the industrial and scientific infrastructure , " huber said .

has the green party found a new weapon against the conservative opposition ? the storms that have wreaked havoc in southern and eastern germany this past week have presented an unintended political opportunity for chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government coallition .
lagging behind the christian democratic union and chrisitian social union in the polls before the sept .
22 elections , schröder ’ s social democratic and green party coalition government has used the flooding to tout their environmental record and attack the union ’ s lack of an environmental vision .
the greens took special issue with chancellor candidate edmund stoiber ’ s failure to appoint a person responsible for environmental affairs in his much-publicised shadow cabinet .
" in the face of the ongoing natural catastrophe , candidate stoiber should reflect on why nobody in his so-called competence team is responsible for the environment , " green foreign minister joschka fischer told the thüringer allgemeine newspaper on tuesday .
" precisely in stoiber ’ s bavaria , there was unchecked construction in the flooded areas . "
weak spot in the opposition 's programme the political pressure on stoiber to think out a sound policy for the long-term consequences of climatic change is now growing .
on tuesday several spd and green politicians as well as representatives from environmental organisations called up stoiber to urge him to appoint an environmental expert in his cabinet .
a recent study by the german environmental ministry showing that just 25 percent of all german environmental activists are in favour of a cdu / csu coalition , has put more heat on stoiber to take action .
the environmental spokesperson of the greens , reinhard loske accused stoiber of " environmental ignorance " .
in a statement he said , " those such as the union who want to end the eco tax and reject the further expansion of renewable energies , are dealing in an utter irresponsible manner " .
a solid government record , say advocates the so-called “ eco tax ” is considered by advocates to be one of the great achievements of schröder ’ s coalition government since it came to power in 1998 .
the tax , placed on everything from fuel to electricity , is meant to spur conservation by gradually increasing the cost of energy and raw materials , kick-start investment aimed at energy conservation and generate revenues to bring down labour costs .
the red-green coalition added another environmental victory to its balance when in june 2000 it got the nuclear industry to agree on the phasing out of nuclear power in germany within the next 30 years .
the two proposals , celebrated by many in the international community , were viewed as a giant step towards achieving the german government ’ s objective of reducing co2 emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by the year 2005 .
both proposals have come under heavy criticism by industry leaders and opposition parties . business leaders felt the eco tax would scare away consumers fearing higher electricity bills and rising gasoline costs . opposition parties have maintained that nuclear energy is the most inexpensive form of energy currently available .
opposition still in favour of nuclear energy stoiber and the rest of the union have stuck to that message .
even in the face of the present catastrophe , a government led by the union parties will continue to rely on the entire spectrum of energy sources – even nuclear energy .
a hike in the ecological tax is also out of the question , said party officials .
" many people don ’ t like it when we say that we will use nuclear energy in the future .
but if we do away with nuclear energy , climate protection will become endlessly expensive , " klaus lippold , the party ’ s environmental expert and vice president of their parliamentary group , told the neue presse in hanover .
he said that the union will advocate " self-regulation on the part of the industry " to achieve climate protection goals .

bavaria 's high-flying it sector has earned the state the nickname as one of " laptops and lederhosen . "
but the german government is eager to prove the rest of germany is catching up . one of eastern germany 's most prestigious investment projects in the it sector , communicant semiconductors technologies , celebrated its cornerstone-laying ceremony on wednesday .
it comes as no surprise that education and research minister edelgard bulmahn stepped in for chancellor gerhard schröder , who had to cancel his visit to the ceremony to visit the flooded regions in eastern germany .
research development is of key interest to the federal government .
in communist east germany , frankfurt on the oder was a center for microelectronics .
but following german reunification , it could n't keep up with the competition from the west .
communicant wants to change that .
and it 's counting on support from berlin .
" this is a good day for the state of brandenburg , " said bulmahn , adding that communicant 's success was important for the federal government .
the 1.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- factory will produce microchips and is expected to begin production in 2004 .
in addition to 1,500 people working at the facility itself , communicant said it anticipates 1,300 further jobs in the service and supply sectors - a welcome change in a region suffering from an unemployment rate of around 20 percent .
major investors are semiconductor giant intel and the emirate dubai .
but the federal government and the state of brandenburg will also contribute 320 million euro -lrb- $ 316 million -rrb- .
education and research for the future the social democratic-green coalition government in berlin has focused on promoting germany as a country geared for the future .
according to the ministry of education and research bmbf , germany has never invested more in education and research projects in its history .
since 1998 , the bmbf budget has jumped over 21 percent to 8.8 billion euro -lrb- $ 8.68 billion -rrb- .
the largest sum is devoted to the it sector .
over the past four years , financing for information technology has increased 13.6 percent to 279.5 million euro -lrb- $ 275.7 million -rrb- , bmbf said .
in 1999 , the bmbf , together with the federal economics ministry , also launched a five-year program called " innovation and jobs in the information society of the 21st century " .
its aims include improving access to new media , promoting multimedia in schools and boosting the it and communication sectors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn earlier this year , the government presented interim results - and hailed the program as a great success .
" germany is more future-oriented than ever before , " said bulmahn -lrb- photo -rrb- .
information and communication technologies sectors had developed into a leading economic sector , contributing to 7 percent of the country 's gross domestic product .
also , e-commerce in germany was posting turnover of some 20 billion euro -lrb- $ 19.7 billion -rrb- , making it the number one in europe for this sector , the government said .
a downward trend in it the german association for information technology , telecommunications and new media , bitkom , welcomed the initiative .
" the federal government achieved its goal of giving significant impulses for a stronger and wider use of information and communication technology , " bitkom 's director general bernhard rohleder said in a statement .
internet access technology , in particular , had expanded .
but , he added , more needs to be done in the education system .
media competence should be integrated as a permanent component of teacher education .
further education in internet use should also be improved , rohleder said .
despite the efforts by the berlin government , the number of jobs in the it and telecommunications sector is declining - for the first time since the early 1990s .
according to bitkom , employment is down 3.4 percent to 791,000 jobs in 2002 .
producers of mobile phones and networks are slashing the most positions , the organization says .
but these cuts do not affect top positions .
" jobs are being cut almost exclusively in administration and distribution , " says stephan pfisterer of bitkom .
this includes many people who entered the it sector from other branches .
" but there is still a demand for it specialists with university degrees or many year 's experience , " he added .
laptops and lederhosen the true home of it in germany is the southern state of bavaria .
the state has introduced several successful programs to attract investors from the new economy sector .
apple , cisco , compaq , microsoft , oracle and sun microsystems are just a few of the companies that have their european or german headquarters in bavaria .
prime minister edmund stoiber , who is the opposition candidate for chancellor in the upcoming federal elections , is making no secret of this success story .

“ the show is a civic initative to cope with the events , and i think it 's very important that the discussion of september 11th is n't left up to the government .
if we want to come to terms with the event we need a broad civic discussion , and that ’ s what the exhibition does . ” visitors to “ here is new york , ” are allowed to formulate their own impressions and interpretations of the event , without the media ’ s filter , said mutert . “ it triggers discussion and gives motivation to rewrite the pictures in your head , giving you multiple perspectives , as opposed to the media ´ s 9/11 coverage , ” he said . berlin touch the berlin show has a home touch , an additional exhibition titled “ mein new york ” -lrb- my new york -rrb- , showcasing berliners ´ own pre-9/11 photos from ny , and their handwritten impressions , and feelings about the catastrophe . “ my husband worked from seven years on the wtc project as technical designer … new york was like our second home and the unthinkable catastrophe that has happened there , hurts us deeply , ” wrote mura grieius , of berlin , in the guest book laid out for the show .
“ we love that fascinating , lively , and sometimes difficult city , and its people .
we visit every year , and we continue to do so in the years to come . ” michael shulan , a new york writer who organized the exhibit with three photographer friends , said he was initially surprised by the great interest and resonance the show received abroad . in time , though , he has begun to see why . “ ground zero can stand for anywhere in the world , and this show is a presentation of people , reacting to things they don ’ t understand , and human emotion , ” he told dw-world .
“ 9/11 is only part of a larger story and now we understand this is only part of a larger problem . ” “ here is new york ” will also be presented in dresden , düsseldorf , stuttgart , and paris to mark the upcoming first anniversary of 9/11 .
the upcoming exhibition in washington d.c. will include photos of the pentagon , taken by official pentagon photographers , revealing an intimate view of the destruction . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the photo exhibit 's web site all of the collected “ here is new york ” photos can be viewed online .

un high commissioner for human rights mary robinson said prosecutors had failed to present the violence in east timor in 1999 as part of a systematic campaign .
the former police chief is accused of failing to stop the massacres on wednesday a court in jakarta found soares guilty of " gross rights violations " committed under his rule , and sentenced him to three years in jail .
another defendant - former east timor police chief general timbul silaen - was acquitted of charges of human rights abuses in the first of several more verdicts expected on thursday .
like soares , he was accused of failing to control his subordinates and take measures to halt violence in various towns of east timor in 1999 .
he was found not guilty of charges of allowing five massacres of civilians in the province .
the soares trial was the first of its kind relating to the bloodshed that gripped the territory after it voted for independence from indonesia in 1999 .
the judge found soares guilty of failing to prevent violence involving his subordinates - but his sentence fell far short of the 10 years and six months demanded by prosecutors .
' scapegoat ' judge emmy marni mustafa said soares had been given a lighter sentence because of a call for leniency from east timor 's president xanana gusmao , who wrote to the court in july saying soares should not be singled out .
soares says he was being made a scapegoat , and has announced he will appeal .
robinson says prosecutors have got it wrong in her response issued in geneva , mrs robinson said prosecutors had " not put before the court evidence that portrays the killings and other human rights violations as part of a widespread or systematic pattern of violence . "
mrs robinson also said a un court in east timor had established that indonesian soldiers had " planned , carried out and directed " pro-indonesian militias to launch attacks against civilians .
a spokesman for un secretary-general kofi annan in new york said he fully endorsed the statement .
apart from general timbul silaen , verdicts are also expected on five members of the security forces on thursday .
human rights groups have criticised the trials , saying senior military figures thought to have orchestrated the pro-jakarta militias are not in the dock .

the authorities moved tommy suharto from jakarta 's cipinang jail - where his air-conditioned cell had a garden view and television - to batu prison on nusakambangan island off java .
tommy has the ability and means to escape and therefore must be transferred to a maximum security prison justice minister yusril ihza mahendra tommy , whose real name is hutomo mandala putra , was sentenced to 15 years in jail for masterminding the murder of a supreme court judge , but there had been allegations of preferential treatment at his prison .
officials said they moved him for security reasons to batu , which is known as the indonesian equivalent of the notorious us prison on alcatraz island .
batu , about 250 kilometres -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- south-east of jakarta , is home to some of indonesia 's most dangerous criminals .
tommy 's cell will be next-door to his father 's former golf partner and trade minister muhammad " bob " hasan who is serving a six-year jail term for corruption .
justice minister yusril ihza mahendra said tommy left cipinang jail before dawn on thursday and arrived at the penal island three hours later .
" tommy has the ability and means to escape and therefore must be transferred to a maximum security prison , " he said .
' no privileges ' mr mahendra said tommy would not receive any privileges .
" the facilities are the same for all - one cell with a toilet for one person .
there have been no renovations , " he said .
tommy 's lawyer elza syarief said he was sad but resigned to the move .
earlier this month , she revealed he wanted to study islam during his imprisonment - a pursuit also said to be followed by hasan .
mr mahendra said : " the brighter side is that bob hasan can give -lsb- tommy -rsb- advice so that he can be a better man . "
tommy was convicted in july of ordering the murder of the judge who found him guilty of corruption , of illegal weapons possession and of going on the run to evade the sentence handed down by the judge who was later killed .
the prison on nusakambangan was opened in the mid-1920s by indonesia 's former dutch colonial rulers and was once considered the harshest penal institution in south east asia .

nonetheless , the firm 's shares ended the day higher on wednesday as it joined the list of companies whose chief executives met the regulators ' deadline to sign a pledge that their accounts were in order .
aol time warner said the suspect transactions had come to light in the past 10 days as a result of a company investigation .
the three transactions were spread over a year and a half , between october 2000 and 31 march this year .
the group 's chief executive , richard parsons , said he hoped the company 's internal inquiry would be completed by the end of september .
better than feared ?
meanwhile , he said , " we are moving forward to implement additional internal controls at aol " .
the sec inquiry focuses on allegations that the company inflated america online 's advertising sales by as much as $ 270m over the last two years .
some observers thought the media giant 's statement might lower the pressure on it over its accounting practices .
" now that the numbers have been disclosed and they 're not that big , it could actually be reassuring because there 's been such a witch hunt on this issue , " said ajay mehra , fund manager at columbia management group .
aol time warner is also being sued by a group of shareholders , who have accused the media giant of fraud , alleging it had sought to hide a fall in advertising revenues at america online .

but it did not produce what some had hoped for - a bold announcement on kashmir that would encourage separatist groups to participate in forthcoming elections .
prime minister atal behari vajpayee also disappointed many when he made only a passing reference to recent religious violence in gujarat state .
mr vajpayee spoke largely on his government 's achievements and challenges before the country such as providing drinking water and education to villagers .
pakistan he began his speech by attacking pakistan for what he described as its unabated sponsorship of terrorism in kashmir .
in a veiled reference to president pervez musharraf 's comments on the kashmir elections , mr vajpayee said that india needed no lessons in democracy from pakistan .
instead , he reiterated india 's determination to hold elections in kashmir even though , he said , militants were equally determined to disrupt the polls .
but the prime minister softened his comments by saying that india did not want war and that he was keen to hold talks with pakistan , if the atmosphere was " congenial " .
he also repeated india 's long-standing viewpoint , that kashmir was an integral part of the country .
jammu and kashmir is india 's only muslim majority state and mr vajpayee said for indians the state was a symbol of its secularism .
kashmir polls mr vajpayee 's comments on kashmir come at a time when preparations are on to hold elections there .
india is anxious to show to the world that the elections will be fair and will usher in a legitimate government .
it appears unlikely that mr vajpayee will visit the state before the elections take place next month .
observers had therefore expected him to use his speech to make a special announcement that would soften the hard stand against elections taken by kashmiri separatists .
the main separatist alliance , the hurriyat conference , has said it will not take part in the elections .
but there was nothing in mr vajpayee 's independence day speech that is likely to encourage the hurriyat to change its mind .
gujarat riots mr vajpayee was equally reticent about gujarat where hindu-muslim riots six months ago left over a thousand people , mainly muslims , dead .
the events in gujarat are still hugely controversial in india , but mr vajpayee 's only comment was to say that violence had no place in national life .
the indian prime minister also highlighted the achievements of his coalition government despite doubts over the viability of his multi-party coalition , his government had not only functioned smoothly but also provided stability , he said .
mr vajpayee has been prime minister for over four years .
he has of late been unwell and now has a strong deputy in the hardline home minister , lk advani , who is seen by many as being in charge .
but mr vajpayee , a moderate , still enjoys considerable support from his allies .

a top official in the bush administration says there is a " very powerful moral case " for deposing the iraqi leader saddam hussein .
in an exclusive interview for the bbc 's 11 september anniversary radio series with us or against us the us national security advisor condoleezza rice outlined the case against the iraqi leader .
she said the iraqi leader had " developed biological weapons , lied to the un repeatedly about the stockpiles ... and had used chemical weapons against his own people and against his neighbours .
" he has invaded his neighbours .
he has killed thousands of his own people .
" he shoots at our planes ... in the no-fly zone where we 're trying to enforce un security resolutions .
and he , despite the fact that he lost this war - a war which he started - negotiates with the un as if he won the war .
" i think it 's a very stunning indictment . "
saddam a ' global threat ' us wants saddam toppled dr rice added : " this is an evil man -lsb- saddam hussein -rsb- who , left to his own devices , will wreak havoc again on his own population , his neighbours and , if he gets weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them , on all of us .
" it is a very powerful moral case for regime change . "
dr rice rejected criticism that any action against iraq would worsen the situation both within the country and the middle east region .
she said it was " rather hard to imagine a more miserable life for the iraqi people than they currently have " , but also stated that any action would be accompanied by an obligation to improve life for ordinary iraqis .
she said : " i would think that at the end of any action that we might take toward regime change , it would be an obligation for all of us to make certain that things are better for the people of the country and the people of the region . "
attack on iraq imminent ?
dr rice 's comments come amid speculation that a us attack on iraq is imminent , despite rumours that the bush administration can not agree on what action should be taken .
she says president bush has not yet decided how to deal with the iraqi leader , but that saddam is considered to be too great a security risk to leave in power .
dr rice said : " we certainly do not have the luxury of doing nothing ... if saddam hussein is left in power , doing the things that he 's doing now , this is a threat that will emerge , and emerge in a very big way .
she also hinted that some form of action would be taken against iraq sooner rather than later .
us ' concerned ' about iran " history is littered with cases of inaction that led to very grave consequences for the world .
we just have to look back and ask how many dictators who end up being a tremendous global threat , and killing thousands , and indeed millions of people , should we have stopped in their tracks . "
us relations with iran dr rice told the bbc that the us also had continuing security concerns about iran , saying : " it 's very clear iran is not on the side of peace .
" iran is on the side of the terrorists in the way that it has been , that these unelected few have been , carrying out the policies of the iranian government .
she said : " i do n't think there 's any doubt that we are concerned that iran is a place where an unelected few are really crushing the aspirations of their people . "
indicating that the us is preparing to take a tough line on all countries suspected of harbouring or supporting terrorists , dr rice warned : " we have all - particularly those who have decided to have diplomatic relations with iran - to be very clear with the iranian government that they can not have this both ways . "
dr rice added : " so what we are saying to the iranians is act like elected leaders , and that these unelected few should not be permitted to hijack the aspirations of the iranian people . "
with us or against us is a new four-part series and will be broadcast on bbc radio 4 , and from this website , weekly on tuesday 27 august 2002 at 2000 bst -lrb- 1900 gmt -rrb- .
the programme will also be broadcast weekly on the bbc world service under the title the diplomatic jigsaw at 1030 bst -lrb- 0930 gmt -rrb- from friday 6 september 2002 .

a review of the pay of the heads of britain 's biggest companies found that their base salaries increased on average by 9.3 % over the past year to £ 574,000 .
and when cash bonuses were included , their income jumped by an average of 11.1 % to £ 869,000 .
the review was carried out by monks partnership , a consultancy arm of accountants pricewaterhousecoopers , and looked at the annual reports of ftse 100 companies produced last year .
smaller rise in a sign of the tougher economic conditions of the past 12 months , the pay rises were lower than last year .
in 2001 , the average salary climbed 14.9 % while total earnings leapt by 16.7 % .
but the tuc said the increases still sent out the wrong signals to employees .
" at a time when corporate confidence is so low , this kind of executive excess is even more disappointing , " said the tuc 's general secretary john monks .
on wednesday the latest pay figures for the whole economy showed average earnings increasing by 3.9 % .
big differences monks partnership said the highest average base salaries were seen in the media sector , while the smallest were at companies in the financial or property sector .
it also found that while average bonus payments were equivalent to 46.5 % of base salary , there were big differences between industry sectors .
those in the retail sector had the lowest bonuses with an average of 14.6 % of salary , while in the pharmaceutical and chemicals sector , chief executives enjoyed bonuses of 81.6 % of salaries .
the monks survey covered the pay of 70 chief executives or full-time chairmen who had been in their job for more than a year .
