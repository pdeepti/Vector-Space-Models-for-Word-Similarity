but with river waters rising , no end is in sight for the misery . the hardest thing for a flood relief worker to cope with is watching people look , stunned and helpless , as water fills and slowly destroys their homes .
" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .
though natural disaster management is usually the role of states , the national thw can also be dispatched in times of crisis .
locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .
i 'm totally overwhelmed . "
the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .
" i 'm sitting in my dry office and came to work just like normal today , " lowke says .
" if we were n't watching television , we might not know what was going on .
but i still do n't know how i 'm going to get home tonight .
there 's only one bridge still open over the elbe , and it could already be covered with water now . "
hard to describe the emotional damage it 's safe to say that no one back at the front lines near the elbe feels removed from the tangible impact of the flooding .
duda of the thk is still tirelessly filling sandbags at the water ’ s edge .
he reflects on the magnitude of the disaster , one of the many he ’ s seen in his 14 years working for the relief agency .
" i 've been on a lot of foreign missions that were worse than this , " he says .
" last year , i was in el salvador after the earthquakes and also other tragedies that were considerably worse .
still , it 's very hard to describe the emotional feeling one has when you see people sitting in front of their homes with resignation , watching as the water comes closer and closer .

but with river waters rising , no end is in sight for the misery . the hardest thing for a flood relief worker to cope with is watching people look , stunned and helpless , as water fills and slowly destroys their homes .
" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .
though natural disaster management is usually the role of states , the national thw can also be dispatched in times of crisis .
locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .
i 'm totally overwhelmed . "
the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .
" i 'm sitting in my dry office and came to work just like normal today , " lowke says .
" if we were n't watching television , we might not know what was going on .
but i still do n't know how i 'm going to get home tonight .
there 's only one bridge still open over the elbe , and it could already be covered with water now . "
hard to describe the emotional damage it 's safe to say that no one back at the front lines near the elbe feels removed from the tangible impact of the flooding .
duda of the thk is still tirelessly filling sandbags at the water ’ s edge .
he reflects on the magnitude of the disaster , one of the many he ’ s seen in his 14 years working for the relief agency .
" i 've been on a lot of foreign missions that were worse than this , " he says .
" last year , i was in el salvador after the earthquakes and also other tragedies that were considerably worse .

a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .

die zahl der arbeitslosen ist im september 2001 ueber den vorjahresstand gestiegen , wie die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit am dienstag , 9 .

die arbeitslosenquote liegt bei 9,0 prozent .
bundesweit gab es 3 , 743 millionen arbeitslose , 58.200 mehr als vor einem jahr und 45.800 weniger als im august 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .

laut dem reformentwurf soll die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit teilprivatisiert werden und sich auf kernaufgaben beschraenken .
nicht mehr zu den aufgaben der behoerde sollen etwa die auszahlung des kindergeldes oder die bekaempfung der illegalen beschaeftigung gehoeren .
in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .
the proposals by the hartz commission that have shone new light on the industry came not from conservative voices unfriendly to unions , but from peter hartz , close friend of social democrat gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is a close friend of the unions .
“ for the first time , the question of temporary work it being accepted – even by the trade unions – and this consensus represents a breakthrough that could lead to reform , ” manfred weiss , professor of labor law at frankfurt ’ s goethe university said in an interview with the christian science monitor .
katja hartmann of manpower sees a bright future for her industry in germany .
while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .
“ people should realize that no country protects their temps more than germany does and they ’ re starting to understand that having a job for life is really a thing of the past , ” she said .

a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .
" slave traders " no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arbeitslose warten vor einem arbeitsamt in berlin auf diesem archivbild vom 4 .

die zahl der arbeitslosen ist im september 2001 ueber den vorjahresstand gestiegen , wie die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit am dienstag , 9 .
oktober 2001 , in nuernberg erklaerte .
die arbeitslosenquote liegt bei 9,0 prozent .
bundesweit gab es 3 , 743 millionen arbeitslose , 58.200 mehr als vor einem jahr und 45.800 weniger als im august 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder , rechts , und peter hartz , vorsitzender der nach ihm benannten hartz-kommission , in berlin .
hartz hat am samstag , 3 .
aug .
2002 davor gewarnt seine vorschlaege zur reform der arbeitsvermittlung im wahlkampf zu zerreiben .
laut dem reformentwurf soll die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit teilprivatisiert werden und sich auf kernaufgaben beschraenken .
nicht mehr zu den aufgaben der behoerde sollen etwa die auszahlung des kindergeldes oder die bekaempfung der illegalen beschaeftigung gehoeren .
in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .
the proposals by the hartz commission that have shone new light on the industry came not from conservative voices unfriendly to unions , but from peter hartz , close friend of social democrat gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is a close friend of the unions .
“ for the first time , the question of temporary work it being accepted – even by the trade unions – and this consensus represents a breakthrough that could lead to reform , ” manfred weiss , professor of labor law at frankfurt ’ s goethe university said in an interview with the christian science monitor .
katja hartmann of manpower sees a bright future for her industry in germany .
while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .
“ people should realize that no country protects their temps more than germany does and they ’ re starting to understand that having a job for life is really a thing of the past , ” she said .

but with river waters rising , no end is in sight for the misery . the hardest thing for a flood relief worker to cope with is watching people look , stunned and helpless , as water fills and slowly destroys their homes .
" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .

locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .

volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .

lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .

the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”
the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union , want to address germany ’ s unemployment problems primarily through tax and social security reforms . industry leaders also had their reservations .
michael rogowski , head of the federation of german industries , said “ there ’ s really no grounds to celebrate the proposals ” and that some of the proposals could lead to lasting state involvement in the labor market . germany ’ s chambers of commerce association , dihk , called the proposals an “ important step , but no breakthrough . ”
it criticized the decision to scrap possible general cuts in unemployment benefits to motivate people to accept jobs offered to them .
although initially considered , the proposal was dropped under pressure from the trade unions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .

a debate at cologne ’ s pop komm music conference brought industry experts together to discuss the implications arising from the influx of manufactured pop personalities on , well , other manufactured pop personalities . the title of the discussion , ' u2 would not be possible today ' , said it all .
on thursday afternoon , record executives and industry experts gathered at the 14th annual popkomm music trade fair in cologne to discuss why .
in the spotlight were the record executives responsible for boy bands like ' nsync and the backstreet boys , the former head of a pioneering hip hop label , an artist and repertoire -lrb- a & r -rrb- executive from warner in germany and the editor of music week uk .
these experts were brought together to debate the reasons why some bands are not being developed and if success stories like u2 's rise to fame can even be duplicated in today 's climate .
under chandeliers in an auditorium on cologne 's trade fair grounds , the real question was about money .
is it possible , in today 's music industry climate , to nurture and invest in an organically formed band 's long term future ?
there were many differing opinions but the general consensus was ' no ' .
this opinion has never had such a ring to it as it has in these days of ‘ pop stars ’ and ‘ pop idol ’ , the television shows that take ordinary , every day folk and create singing stars .
manufactured bands have been with us ever since the monkees started the trend in the sixties .
every decade has had its defining plastic pop group .
the scrapyard of teenage fancy is littered with names such as new kids on the block , take that and the spice girls .
one man who has played a hugely influential part in the more recent manufactured band phenomenon is louis pearlman , the head honcho at transcontinental records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from disney club to world domination , care of lou pearlman .

a debate at cologne ’ s pop komm music conference brought industry experts together to discuss the implications arising from the influx of manufactured pop personalities on , well , other manufactured pop personalities . the title of the discussion , ' u2 would not be possible today ' , said it all .
on thursday afternoon , record executives and industry experts gathered at the 14th annual popkomm music trade fair in cologne to discuss why .
in the spotlight were the record executives responsible for boy bands like ' nsync and the backstreet boys , the former head of a pioneering hip hop label , an artist and repertoire -lrb- a & r -rrb- executive from warner in germany and the editor of music week uk .
these experts were brought together to debate the reasons why some bands are not being developed and if success stories like u2 's rise to fame can even be duplicated in today 's climate .
under chandeliers in an auditorium on cologne 's trade fair grounds , the real question was about money .
is it possible , in today 's music industry climate , to nurture and invest in an organically formed band 's long term future ?
there were many differing opinions but the general consensus was ' no ' .
this opinion has never had such a ring to it as it has in these days of ‘ pop stars ’ and ‘ pop idol ’ , the television shows that take ordinary , every day folk and create singing stars .

a debate at cologne ’ s pop komm music conference brought industry experts together to discuss the implications arising from the influx of manufactured pop personalities on , well , other manufactured pop personalities . the title of the discussion , ' u2 would not be possible today ' , said it all .
on thursday afternoon , record executives and industry experts gathered at the 14th annual popkomm music trade fair in cologne to discuss why .
in the spotlight were the record executives responsible for boy bands like ' nsync and the backstreet boys , the former head of a pioneering hip hop label , an artist and repertoire -lrb- a & r -rrb- executive from warner in germany and the editor of music week uk .
these experts were brought together to debate the reasons why some bands are not being developed and if success stories like u2 's rise to fame can even be duplicated in today 's climate .
under chandeliers in an auditorium on cologne 's trade fair grounds , the real question was about money .
is it possible , in today 's music industry climate , to nurture and invest in an organically formed band 's long term future ?
there were many differing opinions but the general consensus was ' no ' .
this opinion has never had such a ring to it as it has in these days of ‘ pop stars ’ and ‘ pop idol ’ , the television shows that take ordinary , every day folk and create singing stars .
manufactured bands have been with us ever since the monkees started the trend in the sixties .
every decade has had its defining plastic pop group .
the scrapyard of teenage fancy is littered with names such as new kids on the block , take that and the spice girls .
one man who has played a hugely influential part in the more recent manufactured band phenomenon is louis pearlman , the head honcho at transcontinental records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from disney club to world domination , care of lou pearlman .
his team has been responsible for putting together boy bands backstreet boys and ' n sync and guiding a youngster called britney spears towards superstardom .
he is currently pushing new bands o-town and natural in germany , the country who gave backstreet boys their first gold discs thanks to enthusiastic air play .
financial risks holding back new acts pearlman believes that talented bands are not being promoted because the immense amount of money needed to get a group off the ground and into the charts .
and he should know .
pearlman spent 1.5 million euro -lrb- $ 1.47 million -rrb- on the backstreet boys before they even got a sniff of a record deal .
luckily the gamble paid off .
executives nowadays are n't as bold .
the reason is something tom silverman , founder of the seminal hip-hop label tommy boy records and man responsible for the rise of artists de la soul , queen latifah and coolio , calls the ' risk / reward factor ' .
speaking from the pop komm stage , silverman said , " it 'll cost you two and half million dollars to take an act all the way and even if they make it , the reward has to be higher than your costs . "
" look at puff daddy .
he lost his deal with bad boy records even though he sold a million copies of his album .
it did n't make a profit . "
silverman sold his shares in tommy boy to aol time warner before taking up a position as head of an independently minded subsidiary of his former empire . he plans to open a distribution centre in germany that will serve europe . it 's a business markus bruns , an a & r man from warner music group in germany , defended the policies of the big companies .
" our target is to make money .
if you want to invest everything in development , it wo n't work .
if you want to invest everything in marketing , it wo n't work .
you need balance between risk and reward . "
tom silverman offered a ray of hope to the bands that struggle against this ratio . " if you want to take a chance and want a band to succeed , you should say , ' that video will not cost fifty thousand dollars , you 're going to make it for ten , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' popstars ' winners no angels are a product of television as a marketing tool .
for lou pearlman , however , the future already seems bright .
he 's invested heavily in his ' pop stars ' and ' pop idol ' concepts and german winners no angels and bro 'sis are currently climbing up into the pop big leagues , thanks to the programmes ' popularity along with clever marketing .
tv is crucial " you need television to break an artist and specific types of music need television and the media .
having your act on tv cuts the risk and ups the reward , " pearlman said .
moderator ajax scott of music week uk challenged the panel by asking if the plastic band phenomenon was a destabilising , momentary trend and if a new u2 would eclipse the backstreet boys of the future .

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”
the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union , want to address germany ’ s unemployment problems primarily through tax and social security reforms . industry leaders also had their reservations .
michael rogowski , head of the federation of german industries , said “ there ’ s really no grounds to celebrate the proposals ” and that some of the proposals could lead to lasting state involvement in the labor market . germany ’ s chambers of commerce association , dihk , called the proposals an “ important step , but no breakthrough . ”
it criticized the decision to scrap possible general cuts in unemployment benefits to motivate people to accept jobs offered to them .
although initially considered , the proposal was dropped under pressure from the trade unions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.08.2002 relieving job angst through temp work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of temporary workers in germany work in the electronics or metal industries .
a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .
" slave traders " no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arbeitslose warten vor einem arbeitsamt in berlin auf diesem archivbild vom 4 .
maerz 1998 .
die zahl der arbeitslosen ist im september 2001 ueber den vorjahresstand gestiegen , wie die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit am dienstag , 9 .
oktober 2001 , in nuernberg erklaerte .
die arbeitslosenquote liegt bei 9,0 prozent .
bundesweit gab es 3 , 743 millionen arbeitslose , 58.200 mehr als vor einem jahr und 45.800 weniger als im august 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder , rechts , und peter hartz , vorsitzender der nach ihm benannten hartz-kommission , in berlin .
hartz hat am samstag , 3 .
aug .
2002 davor gewarnt seine vorschlaege zur reform der arbeitsvermittlung im wahlkampf zu zerreiben .
laut dem reformentwurf soll die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit teilprivatisiert werden und sich auf kernaufgaben beschraenken .
nicht mehr zu den aufgaben der behoerde sollen etwa die auszahlung des kindergeldes oder die bekaempfung der illegalen beschaeftigung gehoeren .
in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .
the proposals by the hartz commission that have shone new light on the industry came not from conservative voices unfriendly to unions , but from peter hartz , close friend of social democrat gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is a close friend of the unions .
“ for the first time , the question of temporary work it being accepted – even by the trade unions – and this consensus represents a breakthrough that could lead to reform , ” manfred weiss , professor of labor law at frankfurt ’ s goethe university said in an interview with the christian science monitor .
katja hartmann of manpower sees a bright future for her industry in germany .
while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .
“ people should realize that no country protects their temps more than germany does and they ’ re starting to understand that having a job for life is really a thing of the past , ” she said .
“ those kinds of jobs just aren ’ t there anymore . ” kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unemployment rains on schröder 's parade the latest unemployment figures for germany show a further rise , especially in the east .

the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .

-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .

in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .

while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .

she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .

hartz hat am samstag , 3 .
aug .
2002 davor gewarnt seine vorschlaege zur reform der arbeitsvermittlung im wahlkampf zu zerreiben .
laut dem reformentwurf soll die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit teilprivatisiert werden und sich auf kernaufgaben beschraenken .
nicht mehr zu den aufgaben der behoerde sollen etwa die auszahlung des kindergeldes oder die bekaempfung der illegalen beschaeftigung gehoeren .
in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .
the proposals by the hartz commission that have shone new light on the industry came not from conservative voices unfriendly to unions , but from peter hartz , close friend of social democrat gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is a close friend of the unions .
“ for the first time , the question of temporary work it being accepted – even by the trade unions – and this consensus represents a breakthrough that could lead to reform , ” manfred weiss , professor of labor law at frankfurt ’ s goethe university said in an interview with the christian science monitor .
katja hartmann of manpower sees a bright future for her industry in germany .
while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .
“ people should realize that no country protects their temps more than germany does and they ’ re starting to understand that having a job for life is really a thing of the past , ” she said .

dresden is experiencing its worst flooding in 150 years . german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on thursday that the federal government would begin transferring the first 100 million euros -lrb- $ 97.8 million -rrb- of a 385 million euro -lrb- $ 377.6 million -rrb- emergency flood relief package for the flooded eastern and southern parts of the country . the first money will be available on friday , schröder said at a berlin press conference .
considering the “ catastrophic extent of the damages , ” however , this may up being just a preliminary measure , he said . while the overflowing vltava river in prague began subsiding on thursday , dresden was bracing for worsening conditions as the elbe river continued to rise .
on friday morning , officials said the river crossed the 9 meter mark , breaking the 8.77 meter mark set by the record floods in the city in 1845 . much of central dresden and neighboring smaller towns along the elbe stood under water on thursday .
several hundred hospital patients have been evacuated to other towns and the german army has sent a medevac jet to the area in case further medical evacuations are necessary . 20,000 to be evacuated by saturday officials say that at least 10 people have died in germany this week from of flood-related causes .

but with river waters rising , no end is in sight for the misery . the hardest thing for a flood relief worker to cope with is watching people look , stunned and helpless , as water fills and slowly destroys their homes .
" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .
though natural disaster management is usually the role of states , the national thw can also be dispatched in times of crisis .
locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .
i 'm totally overwhelmed . "
the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .
" i 'm sitting in my dry office and came to work just like normal today , " lowke says .
" if we were n't watching television , we might not know what was going on .
but i still do n't know how i 'm going to get home tonight .
there 's only one bridge still open over the elbe , and it could already be covered with water now . "
hard to describe the emotional damage it 's safe to say that no one back at the front lines near the elbe feels removed from the tangible impact of the flooding .
duda of the thk is still tirelessly filling sandbags at the water ’ s edge .
he reflects on the magnitude of the disaster , one of the many he ’ s seen in his 14 years working for the relief agency .
" i 've been on a lot of foreign missions that were worse than this , " he says .
" last year , i was in el salvador after the earthquakes and also other tragedies that were considerably worse .
still , it 's very hard to describe the emotional feeling one has when you see people sitting in front of their homes with resignation , watching as the water comes closer and closer .

but with river waters rising , no end is in sight for the misery . the hardest thing for a flood relief worker to cope with is watching people look , stunned and helpless , as water fills and slowly destroys their homes .
" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .
though natural disaster management is usually the role of states , the national thw can also be dispatched in times of crisis .
locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .
i 'm totally overwhelmed . "
the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .
" i 'm sitting in my dry office and came to work just like normal today , " lowke says .
" if we were n't watching television , we might not know what was going on .
but i still do n't know how i 'm going to get home tonight .
there 's only one bridge still open over the elbe , and it could already be covered with water now . "
hard to describe the emotional damage it 's safe to say that no one back at the front lines near the elbe feels removed from the tangible impact of the flooding .
duda of the thk is still tirelessly filling sandbags at the water ’ s edge .
he reflects on the magnitude of the disaster , one of the many he ’ s seen in his 14 years working for the relief agency .
" i 've been on a lot of foreign missions that were worse than this , " he says .
" last year , i was in el salvador after the earthquakes and also other tragedies that were considerably worse .
still , it 's very hard to describe the emotional feeling one has when you see people sitting in front of their homes with resignation , watching as the water comes closer and closer .

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”
the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union , want to address germany ’ s unemployment problems primarily through tax and social security reforms . industry leaders also had their reservations .

dresden is experiencing its worst flooding in 150 years . german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on thursday that the federal government would begin transferring the first 100 million euros -lrb- $ 97.8 million -rrb- of a 385 million euro -lrb- $ 377.6 million -rrb- emergency flood relief package for the flooded eastern and southern parts of the country . the first money will be available on friday , schröder said at a berlin press conference .
considering the “ catastrophic extent of the damages , ” however , this may up being just a preliminary measure , he said . while the overflowing vltava river in prague began subsiding on thursday , dresden was bracing for worsening conditions as the elbe river continued to rise .
on friday morning , officials said the river crossed the 9 meter mark , breaking the 8.77 meter mark set by the record floods in the city in 1845 . much of central dresden and neighboring smaller towns along the elbe stood under water on thursday .
several hundred hospital patients have been evacuated to other towns and the german army has sent a medevac jet to the area in case further medical evacuations are necessary . 20,000 to be evacuated by saturday officials say that at least 10 people have died in germany this week from of flood-related causes .
and an estimated 20,000 people will be evacuated from their homes in flood-stricken areas of the country by saturday . “ it will take a major national effort to repair the damage caused , ” said schröder after visiting saxony to inspect the flood damage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.08.2002 relieving job angst through temp work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of temporary workers in germany work in the electronics or metal industries .
a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .
" slave traders " no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arbeitslose warten vor einem arbeitsamt in berlin auf diesem archivbild vom 4 .
maerz 1998 .
die zahl der arbeitslosen ist im september 2001 ueber den vorjahresstand gestiegen , wie die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit am dienstag , 9 .
oktober 2001 , in nuernberg erklaerte .
die arbeitslosenquote liegt bei 9,0 prozent .
bundesweit gab es 3 , 743 millionen arbeitslose , 58.200 mehr als vor einem jahr und 45.800 weniger als im august 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder , rechts , und peter hartz , vorsitzender der nach ihm benannten hartz-kommission , in berlin .
hartz hat am samstag , 3 .
aug .
2002 davor gewarnt seine vorschlaege zur reform der arbeitsvermittlung im wahlkampf zu zerreiben .
laut dem reformentwurf soll die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit teilprivatisiert werden und sich auf kernaufgaben beschraenken .
nicht mehr zu den aufgaben der behoerde sollen etwa die auszahlung des kindergeldes oder die bekaempfung der illegalen beschaeftigung gehoeren .
in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .
the proposals by the hartz commission that have shone new light on the industry came not from conservative voices unfriendly to unions , but from peter hartz , close friend of social democrat gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is a close friend of the unions .
“ for the first time , the question of temporary work it being accepted – even by the trade unions – and this consensus represents a breakthrough that could lead to reform , ” manfred weiss , professor of labor law at frankfurt ’ s goethe university said in an interview with the christian science monitor .
katja hartmann of manpower sees a bright future for her industry in germany .
while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .
“ people should realize that no country protects their temps more than germany does and they ’ re starting to understand that having a job for life is really a thing of the past , ” she said .
“ those kinds of jobs just aren ’ t there anymore . ” kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unemployment rains on schröder 's parade the latest unemployment figures for germany show a further rise , especially in the east .

" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .
though natural disaster management is usually the role of states , the national thw can also be dispatched in times of crisis .
locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .
i 'm totally overwhelmed . "
the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .
" i 'm sitting in my dry office and came to work just like normal today , " lowke says .
" if we were n't watching television , we might not know what was going on .
but i still do n't know how i 'm going to get home tonight .
there 's only one bridge still open over the elbe , and it could already be covered with water now . "
hard to describe the emotional damage it 's safe to say that no one back at the front lines near the elbe feels removed from the tangible impact of the flooding .
duda of the thk is still tirelessly filling sandbags at the water ’ s edge .
he reflects on the magnitude of the disaster , one of the many he ’ s seen in his 14 years working for the relief agency .
" i 've been on a lot of foreign missions that were worse than this , " he says .
" last year , i was in el salvador after the earthquakes and also other tragedies that were considerably worse .
still , it 's very hard to describe the emotional feeling one has when you see people sitting in front of their homes with resignation , watching as the water comes closer and closer .

" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .
though natural disaster management is usually the role of states , the national thw can also be dispatched in times of crisis .
locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .

" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .

lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.08.2002 relieving job angst through temp work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of temporary workers in germany work in the electronics or metal industries .
a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .
" slave traders " no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arbeitslose warten vor einem arbeitsamt in berlin auf diesem archivbild vom 4 .
maerz 1998 .
die zahl der arbeitslosen ist im september 2001 ueber den vorjahresstand gestiegen , wie die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit am dienstag , 9 .
oktober 2001 , in nuernberg erklaerte .
die arbeitslosenquote liegt bei 9,0 prozent .
bundesweit gab es 3 , 743 millionen arbeitslose , 58.200 mehr als vor einem jahr und 45.800 weniger als im august 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder , rechts , und peter hartz , vorsitzender der nach ihm benannten hartz-kommission , in berlin .
hartz hat am samstag , 3 .
aug .
2002 davor gewarnt seine vorschlaege zur reform der arbeitsvermittlung im wahlkampf zu zerreiben .
laut dem reformentwurf soll die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit teilprivatisiert werden und sich auf kernaufgaben beschraenken .
nicht mehr zu den aufgaben der behoerde sollen etwa die auszahlung des kindergeldes oder die bekaempfung der illegalen beschaeftigung gehoeren .
in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .
the proposals by the hartz commission that have shone new light on the industry came not from conservative voices unfriendly to unions , but from peter hartz , close friend of social democrat gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is a close friend of the unions .
“ for the first time , the question of temporary work it being accepted – even by the trade unions – and this consensus represents a breakthrough that could lead to reform , ” manfred weiss , professor of labor law at frankfurt ’ s goethe university said in an interview with the christian science monitor .
katja hartmann of manpower sees a bright future for her industry in germany .
while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .
“ people should realize that no country protects their temps more than germany does and they ’ re starting to understand that having a job for life is really a thing of the past , ” she said .
“ those kinds of jobs just aren ’ t there anymore . ” kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unemployment rains on schröder 's parade the latest unemployment figures for germany show a further rise , especially in the east .

a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .

die zahl der arbeitslosen ist im september 2001 ueber den vorjahresstand gestiegen , wie die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit am dienstag , 9 .

die arbeitslosenquote liegt bei 9,0 prozent .
bundesweit gab es 3 , 743 millionen arbeitslose , 58.200 mehr als vor einem jahr und 45.800 weniger als im august 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .

in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .
the proposals by the hartz commission that have shone new light on the industry came not from conservative voices unfriendly to unions , but from peter hartz , close friend of social democrat gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is a close friend of the unions .
“ for the first time , the question of temporary work it being accepted – even by the trade unions – and this consensus represents a breakthrough that could lead to reform , ” manfred weiss , professor of labor law at frankfurt ’ s goethe university said in an interview with the christian science monitor .
katja hartmann of manpower sees a bright future for her industry in germany .
while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .
“ people should realize that no country protects their temps more than germany does and they ’ re starting to understand that having a job for life is really a thing of the past , ” she said .

critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .
" slave traders " no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arbeitslose warten vor einem arbeitsamt in berlin auf diesem archivbild vom 4 .

die zahl der arbeitslosen ist im september 2001 ueber den vorjahresstand gestiegen , wie die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit am dienstag , 9 .
oktober 2001 , in nuernberg erklaerte .
die arbeitslosenquote liegt bei 9,0 prozent .
bundesweit gab es 3 , 743 millionen arbeitslose , 58.200 mehr als vor einem jahr und 45.800 weniger als im august 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .

in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .
the proposals by the hartz commission that have shone new light on the industry came not from conservative voices unfriendly to unions , but from peter hartz , close friend of social democrat gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is a close friend of the unions .
“ for the first time , the question of temporary work it being accepted – even by the trade unions – and this consensus represents a breakthrough that could lead to reform , ” manfred weiss , professor of labor law at frankfurt ’ s goethe university said in an interview with the christian science monitor .
katja hartmann of manpower sees a bright future for her industry in germany .
while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .
“ people should realize that no country protects their temps more than germany does and they ’ re starting to understand that having a job for life is really a thing of the past , ” she said .

a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .

the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .

a debate at cologne ’ s pop komm music conference brought industry experts together to discuss the implications arising from the influx of manufactured pop personalities on , well , other manufactured pop personalities . the title of the discussion , ' u2 would not be possible today ' , said it all .
on thursday afternoon , record executives and industry experts gathered at the 14th annual popkomm music trade fair in cologne to discuss why .
in the spotlight were the record executives responsible for boy bands like ' nsync and the backstreet boys , the former head of a pioneering hip hop label , an artist and repertoire -lrb- a & r -rrb- executive from warner in germany and the editor of music week uk .
these experts were brought together to debate the reasons why some bands are not being developed and if success stories like u2 's rise to fame can even be duplicated in today 's climate .
under chandeliers in an auditorium on cologne 's trade fair grounds , the real question was about money .
is it possible , in today 's music industry climate , to nurture and invest in an organically formed band 's long term future ?
there were many differing opinions but the general consensus was ' no ' .
this opinion has never had such a ring to it as it has in these days of ‘ pop stars ’ and ‘ pop idol ’ , the television shows that take ordinary , every day folk and create singing stars .
manufactured bands have been with us ever since the monkees started the trend in the sixties .
every decade has had its defining plastic pop group .
the scrapyard of teenage fancy is littered with names such as new kids on the block , take that and the spice girls .
one man who has played a hugely influential part in the more recent manufactured band phenomenon is louis pearlman , the head honcho at transcontinental records .

his team has been responsible for putting together boy bands backstreet boys and ' n sync and guiding a youngster called britney spears towards superstardom .
he is currently pushing new bands o-town and natural in germany , the country who gave backstreet boys their first gold discs thanks to enthusiastic air play .
financial risks holding back new acts pearlman believes that talented bands are not being promoted because the immense amount of money needed to get a group off the ground and into the charts .
and he should know .
pearlman spent 1.5 million euro -lrb- $ 1.47 million -rrb- on the backstreet boys before they even got a sniff of a record deal .
luckily the gamble paid off .
executives nowadays are n't as bold .
the reason is something tom silverman , founder of the seminal hip-hop label tommy boy records and man responsible for the rise of artists de la soul , queen latifah and coolio , calls the ' risk / reward factor ' .
speaking from the pop komm stage , silverman said , " it 'll cost you two and half million dollars to take an act all the way and even if they make it , the reward has to be higher than your costs . "
" look at puff daddy .
he lost his deal with bad boy records even though he sold a million copies of his album .
it did n't make a profit . "
silverman sold his shares in tommy boy to aol time warner before taking up a position as head of an independently minded subsidiary of his former empire . he plans to open a distribution centre in germany that will serve europe . it 's a business markus bruns , an a & r man from warner music group in germany , defended the policies of the big companies .
" our target is to make money .
if you want to invest everything in development , it wo n't work .
if you want to invest everything in marketing , it wo n't work .
you need balance between risk and reward . "
tom silverman offered a ray of hope to the bands that struggle against this ratio . " if you want to take a chance and want a band to succeed , you should say , ' that video will not cost fifty thousand dollars , you 're going to make it for ten , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' popstars ' winners no angels are a product of television as a marketing tool .
for lou pearlman , however , the future already seems bright .
he 's invested heavily in his ' pop stars ' and ' pop idol ' concepts and german winners no angels and bro 'sis are currently climbing up into the pop big leagues , thanks to the programmes ' popularity along with clever marketing .
tv is crucial " you need television to break an artist and specific types of music need television and the media .
having your act on tv cuts the risk and ups the reward , " pearlman said .
moderator ajax scott of music week uk challenged the panel by asking if the plastic band phenomenon was a destabilising , momentary trend and if a new u2 would eclipse the backstreet boys of the future .

a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .

die zahl der arbeitslosen ist im september 2001 ueber den vorjahresstand gestiegen , wie die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit am dienstag , 9 .

die arbeitslosenquote liegt bei 9,0 prozent .
bundesweit gab es 3 , 743 millionen arbeitslose , 58.200 mehr als vor einem jahr und 45.800 weniger als im august 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .

in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .
the proposals by the hartz commission that have shone new light on the industry came not from conservative voices unfriendly to unions , but from peter hartz , close friend of social democrat gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is a close friend of the unions .
“ for the first time , the question of temporary work it being accepted – even by the trade unions – and this consensus represents a breakthrough that could lead to reform , ” manfred weiss , professor of labor law at frankfurt ’ s goethe university said in an interview with the christian science monitor .
katja hartmann of manpower sees a bright future for her industry in germany .
while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .
“ people should realize that no country protects their temps more than germany does and they ’ re starting to understand that having a job for life is really a thing of the past , ” she said .

in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .

“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .

a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .

dresden is experiencing its worst flooding in 150 years . german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on thursday that the federal government would begin transferring the first 100 million euros -lrb- $ 97.8 million -rrb- of a 385 million euro -lrb- $ 377.6 million -rrb- emergency flood relief package for the flooded eastern and southern parts of the country . the first money will be available on friday , schröder said at a berlin press conference .
considering the “ catastrophic extent of the damages , ” however , this may up being just a preliminary measure , he said . while the overflowing vltava river in prague began subsiding on thursday , dresden was bracing for worsening conditions as the elbe river continued to rise .
on friday morning , officials said the river crossed the 9 meter mark , breaking the 8.77 meter mark set by the record floods in the city in 1845 . much of central dresden and neighboring smaller towns along the elbe stood under water on thursday .
several hundred hospital patients have been evacuated to other towns and the german army has sent a medevac jet to the area in case further medical evacuations are necessary . 20,000 to be evacuated by saturday officials say that at least 10 people have died in germany this week from of flood-related causes .
and an estimated 20,000 people will be evacuated from their homes in flood-stricken areas of the country by saturday . “ it will take a major national effort to repair the damage caused , ” said schröder after visiting saxony to inspect the flood damage .
“ the whole nation will have to help . ” the emergency relief plan approved by the federal government on wednesday calls for , among other things , the creation of a credit program with subsidized interest rates ; 25 million euros -lrb- $ 24.5 million -rrb- for infrastructure damage ; and the creation of a 50 million euro -lrb- $ 49 million -rrb- program that would give 5,000 unemployed germans flood clean-up jobs . hamburg braces for possible flooding the flooding is far from over in germany .
in hamburg , several hundred kilometers to the north of dresden , police and firefighters are preparing for floods , which officials believe could hit the harbor city by the middle of next week . german politicians in brussels have appealed to the european union for assistance with the flood relief effort , which is expected to cost billions of euros .
but the eu , which eliminated its budget for natural catastrophes several years ago , has told politicians from central and eastern europe not to expect much in the way of assistance . an estimated 21.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.2 billion -rrb- earmarked for regional development programs could be reappropriated , the eu said .
but more funding will be hard to come by . the german red cross , meanwhile , announced a 1 million euro emergency flood relief program . while the economic fallout from this week ’ s flooding is still being tallied , political observers said the catastrophe is doing wonders for schröder ’ s re-election effort . opportunity for schröder “ schröder has been handed a golden opportunity to present himself as a crisis manager , ” dietmar herz , political scientist at erfurt university told reuters .
“ the public tends to rally around their leaders in times of crises .
schröder got a chance to show what he can do . ” opposition candidate edmund stoiber has come under criticism this week because he only briefly interrupted his vacation to visit flood-affected areas in his home state of bavaria . other european countries continued their own flood-fighting efforts on thursday .
the slovak capital of bratislava , which lies along the danube river , was bracing for the worst flooding in centuries .
an estimated 70,000 people were being evacuated . an estimated 85 people have died from flood-related causes across europe in the past week . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storms hit european farmers unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .

but with river waters rising , no end is in sight for the misery . the hardest thing for a flood relief worker to cope with is watching people look , stunned and helpless , as water fills and slowly destroys their homes .
" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .
though natural disaster management is usually the role of states , the national thw can also be dispatched in times of crisis .
locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .
i 'm totally overwhelmed . "
the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .
" i 'm sitting in my dry office and came to work just like normal today , " lowke says .
" if we were n't watching television , we might not know what was going on .
but i still do n't know how i 'm going to get home tonight .
there 's only one bridge still open over the elbe , and it could already be covered with water now . "
hard to describe the emotional damage it 's safe to say that no one back at the front lines near the elbe feels removed from the tangible impact of the flooding .
duda of the thk is still tirelessly filling sandbags at the water ’ s edge .
he reflects on the magnitude of the disaster , one of the many he ’ s seen in his 14 years working for the relief agency .
" i 've been on a lot of foreign missions that were worse than this , " he says .

locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .
i 'm totally overwhelmed . "
the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .
" i 'm sitting in my dry office and came to work just like normal today , " lowke says .
" if we were n't watching television , we might not know what was going on .
but i still do n't know how i 'm going to get home tonight .
there 's only one bridge still open over the elbe , and it could already be covered with water now . "
hard to describe the emotional damage it 's safe to say that no one back at the front lines near the elbe feels removed from the tangible impact of the flooding .
duda of the thk is still tirelessly filling sandbags at the water ’ s edge .
he reflects on the magnitude of the disaster , one of the many he ’ s seen in his 14 years working for the relief agency .
" i 've been on a lot of foreign missions that were worse than this , " he says .
" last year , i was in el salvador after the earthquakes and also other tragedies that were considerably worse .
still , it 's very hard to describe the emotional feeling one has when you see people sitting in front of their homes with resignation , watching as the water comes closer and closer .

but with river waters rising , no end is in sight for the misery . the hardest thing for a flood relief worker to cope with is watching people look , stunned and helpless , as water fills and slowly destroys their homes .
" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .

a debate at cologne ’ s pop komm music conference brought industry experts together to discuss the implications arising from the influx of manufactured pop personalities on , well , other manufactured pop personalities . the title of the discussion , ' u2 would not be possible today ' , said it all .
on thursday afternoon , record executives and industry experts gathered at the 14th annual popkomm music trade fair in cologne to discuss why .
in the spotlight were the record executives responsible for boy bands like ' nsync and the backstreet boys , the former head of a pioneering hip hop label , an artist and repertoire -lrb- a & r -rrb- executive from warner in germany and the editor of music week uk .
these experts were brought together to debate the reasons why some bands are not being developed and if success stories like u2 's rise to fame can even be duplicated in today 's climate .
under chandeliers in an auditorium on cologne 's trade fair grounds , the real question was about money .
is it possible , in today 's music industry climate , to nurture and invest in an organically formed band 's long term future ?
there were many differing opinions but the general consensus was ' no ' .
this opinion has never had such a ring to it as it has in these days of ‘ pop stars ’ and ‘ pop idol ’ , the television shows that take ordinary , every day folk and create singing stars .

the reason is something tom silverman , founder of the seminal hip-hop label tommy boy records and man responsible for the rise of artists de la soul , queen latifah and coolio , calls the ' risk / reward factor ' .

a debate at cologne ’ s pop komm music conference brought industry experts together to discuss the implications arising from the influx of manufactured pop personalities on , well , other manufactured pop personalities . the title of the discussion , ' u2 would not be possible today ' , said it all .
on thursday afternoon , record executives and industry experts gathered at the 14th annual popkomm music trade fair in cologne to discuss why .
in the spotlight were the record executives responsible for boy bands like ' nsync and the backstreet boys , the former head of a pioneering hip hop label , an artist and repertoire -lrb- a & r -rrb- executive from warner in germany and the editor of music week uk .
these experts were brought together to debate the reasons why some bands are not being developed and if success stories like u2 's rise to fame can even be duplicated in today 's climate .
under chandeliers in an auditorium on cologne 's trade fair grounds , the real question was about money .
is it possible , in today 's music industry climate , to nurture and invest in an organically formed band 's long term future ?
there were many differing opinions but the general consensus was ' no ' .
this opinion has never had such a ring to it as it has in these days of ‘ pop stars ’ and ‘ pop idol ’ , the television shows that take ordinary , every day folk and create singing stars .
manufactured bands have been with us ever since the monkees started the trend in the sixties .
every decade has had its defining plastic pop group .
the scrapyard of teenage fancy is littered with names such as new kids on the block , take that and the spice girls .
one man who has played a hugely influential part in the more recent manufactured band phenomenon is louis pearlman , the head honcho at transcontinental records .

his team has been responsible for putting together boy bands backstreet boys and ' n sync and guiding a youngster called britney spears towards superstardom .
he is currently pushing new bands o-town and natural in germany , the country who gave backstreet boys their first gold discs thanks to enthusiastic air play .
financial risks holding back new acts pearlman believes that talented bands are not being promoted because the immense amount of money needed to get a group off the ground and into the charts .
and he should know .
pearlman spent 1.5 million euro -lrb- $ 1.47 million -rrb- on the backstreet boys before they even got a sniff of a record deal .
luckily the gamble paid off .
executives nowadays are n't as bold .
the reason is something tom silverman , founder of the seminal hip-hop label tommy boy records and man responsible for the rise of artists de la soul , queen latifah and coolio , calls the ' risk / reward factor ' .
speaking from the pop komm stage , silverman said , " it 'll cost you two and half million dollars to take an act all the way and even if they make it , the reward has to be higher than your costs . "

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”

but with river waters rising , no end is in sight for the misery . the hardest thing for a flood relief worker to cope with is watching people look , stunned and helpless , as water fills and slowly destroys their homes .
" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .
though natural disaster management is usually the role of states , the national thw can also be dispatched in times of crisis .
locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .
i 'm totally overwhelmed . "
the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .
" i 'm sitting in my dry office and came to work just like normal today , " lowke says .
" if we were n't watching television , we might not know what was going on .
but i still do n't know how i 'm going to get home tonight .
there 's only one bridge still open over the elbe , and it could already be covered with water now . "
hard to describe the emotional damage it 's safe to say that no one back at the front lines near the elbe feels removed from the tangible impact of the flooding .
duda of the thk is still tirelessly filling sandbags at the water ’ s edge .
he reflects on the magnitude of the disaster , one of the many he ’ s seen in his 14 years working for the relief agency .
" i 've been on a lot of foreign missions that were worse than this , " he says .
" last year , i was in el salvador after the earthquakes and also other tragedies that were considerably worse .
still , it 's very hard to describe the emotional feeling one has when you see people sitting in front of their homes with resignation , watching as the water comes closer and closer .

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”
the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union , want to address germany ’ s unemployment problems primarily through tax and social security reforms . industry leaders also had their reservations .
michael rogowski , head of the federation of german industries , said “ there ’ s really no grounds to celebrate the proposals ” and that some of the proposals could lead to lasting state involvement in the labor market . germany ’ s chambers of commerce association , dihk , called the proposals an “ important step , but no breakthrough . ”
it criticized the decision to scrap possible general cuts in unemployment benefits to motivate people to accept jobs offered to them .
although initially considered , the proposal was dropped under pressure from the trade unions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .

a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .

die arbeitslosenquote liegt bei 9,0 prozent .
bundesweit gab es 3 , 743 millionen arbeitslose , 58.200 mehr als vor einem jahr und 45.800 weniger als im august 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .

in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .
the proposals by the hartz commission that have shone new light on the industry came not from conservative voices unfriendly to unions , but from peter hartz , close friend of social democrat gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is a close friend of the unions .
“ for the first time , the question of temporary work it being accepted – even by the trade unions – and this consensus represents a breakthrough that could lead to reform , ” manfred weiss , professor of labor law at frankfurt ’ s goethe university said in an interview with the christian science monitor .
katja hartmann of manpower sees a bright future for her industry in germany .
while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .
“ people should realize that no country protects their temps more than germany does and they ’ re starting to understand that having a job for life is really a thing of the past , ” she said .

a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .

-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”
the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union , want to address germany ’ s unemployment problems primarily through tax and social security reforms . industry leaders also had their reservations .
michael rogowski , head of the federation of german industries , said “ there ’ s really no grounds to celebrate the proposals ” and that some of the proposals could lead to lasting state involvement in the labor market . germany ’ s chambers of commerce association , dihk , called the proposals an “ important step , but no breakthrough . ”
it criticized the decision to scrap possible general cuts in unemployment benefits to motivate people to accept jobs offered to them .
although initially considered , the proposal was dropped under pressure from the trade unions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.08.2002 labor reform plans for germany officially unveiled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder hopes the hartz commission suggestions will boost his chances for reelection .
a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”
the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union , want to address germany ’ s unemployment problems primarily through tax and social security reforms . industry leaders also had their reservations .
michael rogowski , head of the federation of german industries , said “ there ’ s really no grounds to celebrate the proposals ” and that some of the proposals could lead to lasting state involvement in the labor market . germany ’ s chambers of commerce association , dihk , called the proposals an “ important step , but no breakthrough . ”
it criticized the decision to scrap possible general cuts in unemployment benefits to motivate people to accept jobs offered to them .
although initially considered , the proposal was dropped under pressure from the trade unions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”
the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union , want to address germany ’ s unemployment problems primarily through tax and social security reforms . industry leaders also had their reservations .
michael rogowski , head of the federation of german industries , said “ there ’ s really no grounds to celebrate the proposals ” and that some of the proposals could lead to lasting state involvement in the labor market . germany ’ s chambers of commerce association , dihk , called the proposals an “ important step , but no breakthrough . ”
it criticized the decision to scrap possible general cuts in unemployment benefits to motivate people to accept jobs offered to them .

a debate at cologne ’ s pop komm music conference brought industry experts together to discuss the implications arising from the influx of manufactured pop personalities on , well , other manufactured pop personalities . the title of the discussion , ' u2 would not be possible today ' , said it all .
on thursday afternoon , record executives and industry experts gathered at the 14th annual popkomm music trade fair in cologne to discuss why .
in the spotlight were the record executives responsible for boy bands like ' nsync and the backstreet boys , the former head of a pioneering hip hop label , an artist and repertoire -lrb- a & r -rrb- executive from warner in germany and the editor of music week uk .
these experts were brought together to debate the reasons why some bands are not being developed and if success stories like u2 's rise to fame can even be duplicated in today 's climate .
under chandeliers in an auditorium on cologne 's trade fair grounds , the real question was about money .
is it possible , in today 's music industry climate , to nurture and invest in an organically formed band 's long term future ?
there were many differing opinions but the general consensus was ' no ' .
this opinion has never had such a ring to it as it has in these days of ‘ pop stars ’ and ‘ pop idol ’ , the television shows that take ordinary , every day folk and create singing stars .
manufactured bands have been with us ever since the monkees started the trend in the sixties .
every decade has had its defining plastic pop group .

his team has been responsible for putting together boy bands backstreet boys and ' n sync and guiding a youngster called britney spears towards superstardom .
he is currently pushing new bands o-town and natural in germany , the country who gave backstreet boys their first gold discs thanks to enthusiastic air play .

pearlman spent 1.5 million euro -lrb- $ 1.47 million -rrb- on the backstreet boys before they even got a sniff of a record deal .
luckily the gamble paid off .
executives nowadays are n't as bold .
the reason is something tom silverman , founder of the seminal hip-hop label tommy boy records and man responsible for the rise of artists de la soul , queen latifah and coolio , calls the ' risk / reward factor ' .
speaking from the pop komm stage , silverman said , " it 'll cost you two and half million dollars to take an act all the way and even if they make it , the reward has to be higher than your costs . "
" look at puff daddy .
he lost his deal with bad boy records even though he sold a million copies of his album .

" our target is to make money .
if you want to invest everything in development , it wo n't work .
if you want to invest everything in marketing , it wo n't work .
you need balance between risk and reward . "
tom silverman offered a ray of hope to the bands that struggle against this ratio . " if you want to take a chance and want a band to succeed , you should say , ' that video will not cost fifty thousand dollars , you 're going to make it for ten , " he said .

tv is crucial " you need television to break an artist and specific types of music need television and the media .
having your act on tv cuts the risk and ups the reward , " pearlman said .
moderator ajax scott of music week uk challenged the panel by asking if the plastic band phenomenon was a destabilising , momentary trend and if a new u2 would eclipse the backstreet boys of the future .

a debate at cologne ’ s pop komm music conference brought industry experts together to discuss the implications arising from the influx of manufactured pop personalities on , well , other manufactured pop personalities . the title of the discussion , ' u2 would not be possible today ' , said it all .
on thursday afternoon , record executives and industry experts gathered at the 14th annual popkomm music trade fair in cologne to discuss why .
in the spotlight were the record executives responsible for boy bands like ' nsync and the backstreet boys , the former head of a pioneering hip hop label , an artist and repertoire -lrb- a & r -rrb- executive from warner in germany and the editor of music week uk .
these experts were brought together to debate the reasons why some bands are not being developed and if success stories like u2 's rise to fame can even be duplicated in today 's climate .
under chandeliers in an auditorium on cologne 's trade fair grounds , the real question was about money .
is it possible , in today 's music industry climate , to nurture and invest in an organically formed band 's long term future ?
there were many differing opinions but the general consensus was ' no ' .
this opinion has never had such a ring to it as it has in these days of ‘ pop stars ’ and ‘ pop idol ’ , the television shows that take ordinary , every day folk and create singing stars .

but with river waters rising , no end is in sight for the misery . the hardest thing for a flood relief worker to cope with is watching people look , stunned and helpless , as water fills and slowly destroys their homes .
" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .
though natural disaster management is usually the role of states , the national thw can also be dispatched in times of crisis .
locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .
i 'm totally overwhelmed . "
the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .
" i 'm sitting in my dry office and came to work just like normal today , " lowke says .
" if we were n't watching television , we might not know what was going on .
but i still do n't know how i 'm going to get home tonight .
there 's only one bridge still open over the elbe , and it could already be covered with water now . "
hard to describe the emotional damage it 's safe to say that no one back at the front lines near the elbe feels removed from the tangible impact of the flooding .
duda of the thk is still tirelessly filling sandbags at the water ’ s edge .
he reflects on the magnitude of the disaster , one of the many he ’ s seen in his 14 years working for the relief agency .
" i 've been on a lot of foreign missions that were worse than this , " he says .
" last year , i was in el salvador after the earthquakes and also other tragedies that were considerably worse .
still , it 's very hard to describe the emotional feeling one has when you see people sitting in front of their homes with resignation , watching as the water comes closer and closer .

but with river waters rising , no end is in sight for the misery . the hardest thing for a flood relief worker to cope with is watching people look , stunned and helpless , as water fills and slowly destroys their homes .
" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .
though natural disaster management is usually the role of states , the national thw can also be dispatched in times of crisis .
locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .
i 'm totally overwhelmed . "
the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .
" i 'm sitting in my dry office and came to work just like normal today , " lowke says .
" if we were n't watching television , we might not know what was going on .
but i still do n't know how i 'm going to get home tonight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.08.2002 relieving job angst through temp work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of temporary workers in germany work in the electronics or metal industries .
a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .
" slave traders " no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arbeitslose warten vor einem arbeitsamt in berlin auf diesem archivbild vom 4 .
maerz 1998 .
die zahl der arbeitslosen ist im september 2001 ueber den vorjahresstand gestiegen , wie die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit am dienstag , 9 .
oktober 2001 , in nuernberg erklaerte .
die arbeitslosenquote liegt bei 9,0 prozent .
bundesweit gab es 3 , 743 millionen arbeitslose , 58.200 mehr als vor einem jahr und 45.800 weniger als im august 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder , rechts , und peter hartz , vorsitzender der nach ihm benannten hartz-kommission , in berlin .
hartz hat am samstag , 3 .
aug .
2002 davor gewarnt seine vorschlaege zur reform der arbeitsvermittlung im wahlkampf zu zerreiben .
laut dem reformentwurf soll die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit teilprivatisiert werden und sich auf kernaufgaben beschraenken .
nicht mehr zu den aufgaben der behoerde sollen etwa die auszahlung des kindergeldes oder die bekaempfung der illegalen beschaeftigung gehoeren .
in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .
the proposals by the hartz commission that have shone new light on the industry came not from conservative voices unfriendly to unions , but from peter hartz , close friend of social democrat gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is a close friend of the unions .
“ for the first time , the question of temporary work it being accepted – even by the trade unions – and this consensus represents a breakthrough that could lead to reform , ” manfred weiss , professor of labor law at frankfurt ’ s goethe university said in an interview with the christian science monitor .
katja hartmann of manpower sees a bright future for her industry in germany .
while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .
“ people should realize that no country protects their temps more than germany does and they ’ re starting to understand that having a job for life is really a thing of the past , ” she said .

dresden is experiencing its worst flooding in 150 years . german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on thursday that the federal government would begin transferring the first 100 million euros -lrb- $ 97.8 million -rrb- of a 385 million euro -lrb- $ 377.6 million -rrb- emergency flood relief package for the flooded eastern and southern parts of the country . the first money will be available on friday , schröder said at a berlin press conference .
considering the “ catastrophic extent of the damages , ” however , this may up being just a preliminary measure , he said . while the overflowing vltava river in prague began subsiding on thursday , dresden was bracing for worsening conditions as the elbe river continued to rise .
on friday morning , officials said the river crossed the 9 meter mark , breaking the 8.77 meter mark set by the record floods in the city in 1845 . much of central dresden and neighboring smaller towns along the elbe stood under water on thursday .
several hundred hospital patients have been evacuated to other towns and the german army has sent a medevac jet to the area in case further medical evacuations are necessary . 20,000 to be evacuated by saturday officials say that at least 10 people have died in germany this week from of flood-related causes .
and an estimated 20,000 people will be evacuated from their homes in flood-stricken areas of the country by saturday . “ it will take a major national effort to repair the damage caused , ” said schröder after visiting saxony to inspect the flood damage .
“ the whole nation will have to help . ” the emergency relief plan approved by the federal government on wednesday calls for , among other things , the creation of a credit program with subsidized interest rates ; 25 million euros -lrb- $ 24.5 million -rrb- for infrastructure damage ; and the creation of a 50 million euro -lrb- $ 49 million -rrb- program that would give 5,000 unemployed germans flood clean-up jobs . hamburg braces for possible flooding the flooding is far from over in germany .
in hamburg , several hundred kilometers to the north of dresden , police and firefighters are preparing for floods , which officials believe could hit the harbor city by the middle of next week . german politicians in brussels have appealed to the european union for assistance with the flood relief effort , which is expected to cost billions of euros .
but the eu , which eliminated its budget for natural catastrophes several years ago , has told politicians from central and eastern europe not to expect much in the way of assistance . an estimated 21.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.2 billion -rrb- earmarked for regional development programs could be reappropriated , the eu said .
but more funding will be hard to come by . the german red cross , meanwhile , announced a 1 million euro emergency flood relief program . while the economic fallout from this week ’ s flooding is still being tallied , political observers said the catastrophe is doing wonders for schröder ’ s re-election effort . opportunity for schröder “ schröder has been handed a golden opportunity to present himself as a crisis manager , ” dietmar herz , political scientist at erfurt university told reuters .
“ the public tends to rally around their leaders in times of crises .

a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .

bundesweit gab es 3 , 743 millionen arbeitslose , 58.200 mehr als vor einem jahr und 45.800 weniger als im august 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .

dresden is experiencing its worst flooding in 150 years . german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on thursday that the federal government would begin transferring the first 100 million euros -lrb- $ 97.8 million -rrb- of a 385 million euro -lrb- $ 377.6 million -rrb- emergency flood relief package for the flooded eastern and southern parts of the country . the first money will be available on friday , schröder said at a berlin press conference .
considering the “ catastrophic extent of the damages , ” however , this may up being just a preliminary measure , he said . while the overflowing vltava river in prague began subsiding on thursday , dresden was bracing for worsening conditions as the elbe river continued to rise .
on friday morning , officials said the river crossed the 9 meter mark , breaking the 8.77 meter mark set by the record floods in the city in 1845 . much of central dresden and neighboring smaller towns along the elbe stood under water on thursday .
several hundred hospital patients have been evacuated to other towns and the german army has sent a medevac jet to the area in case further medical evacuations are necessary . 20,000 to be evacuated by saturday officials say that at least 10 people have died in germany this week from of flood-related causes .
and an estimated 20,000 people will be evacuated from their homes in flood-stricken areas of the country by saturday . “ it will take a major national effort to repair the damage caused , ” said schröder after visiting saxony to inspect the flood damage .
“ the whole nation will have to help . ” the emergency relief plan approved by the federal government on wednesday calls for , among other things , the creation of a credit program with subsidized interest rates ; 25 million euros -lrb- $ 24.5 million -rrb- for infrastructure damage ; and the creation of a 50 million euro -lrb- $ 49 million -rrb- program that would give 5,000 unemployed germans flood clean-up jobs . hamburg braces for possible flooding the flooding is far from over in germany .
in hamburg , several hundred kilometers to the north of dresden , police and firefighters are preparing for floods , which officials believe could hit the harbor city by the middle of next week . german politicians in brussels have appealed to the european union for assistance with the flood relief effort , which is expected to cost billions of euros .
but the eu , which eliminated its budget for natural catastrophes several years ago , has told politicians from central and eastern europe not to expect much in the way of assistance . an estimated 21.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.2 billion -rrb- earmarked for regional development programs could be reappropriated , the eu said .
but more funding will be hard to come by . the german red cross , meanwhile , announced a 1 million euro emergency flood relief program . while the economic fallout from this week ’ s flooding is still being tallied , political observers said the catastrophe is doing wonders for schröder ’ s re-election effort . opportunity for schröder “ schröder has been handed a golden opportunity to present himself as a crisis manager , ” dietmar herz , political scientist at erfurt university told reuters .
“ the public tends to rally around their leaders in times of crises .
schröder got a chance to show what he can do . ” opposition candidate edmund stoiber has come under criticism this week because he only briefly interrupted his vacation to visit flood-affected areas in his home state of bavaria . other european countries continued their own flood-fighting efforts on thursday .
the slovak capital of bratislava , which lies along the danube river , was bracing for the worst flooding in centuries .
an estimated 70,000 people were being evacuated . an estimated 85 people have died from flood-related causes across europe in the past week . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de storms hit european farmers unseasonably heavy rains have wreaked havoc across much of europe this summer , ruining many people 's holiday plans .

but with river waters rising , no end is in sight for the misery . the hardest thing for a flood relief worker to cope with is watching people look , stunned and helpless , as water fills and slowly destroys their homes .
" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .
though natural disaster management is usually the role of states , the national thw can also be dispatched in times of crisis .
locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .
i 'm totally overwhelmed . "
the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .
" i 'm sitting in my dry office and came to work just like normal today , " lowke says .
" if we were n't watching television , we might not know what was going on .
but i still do n't know how i 'm going to get home tonight .
there 's only one bridge still open over the elbe , and it could already be covered with water now . "
hard to describe the emotional damage it 's safe to say that no one back at the front lines near the elbe feels removed from the tangible impact of the flooding .
duda of the thk is still tirelessly filling sandbags at the water ’ s edge .
he reflects on the magnitude of the disaster , one of the many he ’ s seen in his 14 years working for the relief agency .
" i 've been on a lot of foreign missions that were worse than this , " he says .
" last year , i was in el salvador after the earthquakes and also other tragedies that were considerably worse .
still , it 's very hard to describe the emotional feeling one has when you see people sitting in front of their homes with resignation , watching as the water comes closer and closer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dealing with a rising disaster rescuing dresden 's cultural treasures wanted : loads of clean energy environment becomes a political football in germany deadly storms lash europe germany -pipe- 16.08.2002 german aid workers await the worst großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some relief workers , like these firemen in grimma , all there is to do is look on as the waters rise thousands of relief workers are helping cities from dresden to passau prevent the biggest flood disaster in years from claiming yet more lives .
but with river waters rising , no end is in sight for the misery . the hardest thing for a flood relief worker to cope with is watching people look , stunned and helpless , as water fills and slowly destroys their homes .
" all they can do is look on as the water pours in , " says 29-year-old stephen duda , an employee with the german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- from the scene of some of the worst flooding in dresden in 150 years .
thousands have been driven from their homes and the flooding has caused damages estimated in the billions of euros .
" there is absolutely nothing they can do to keep the water from coming , " he tells dw-world , with a tone of exasperation .
for two days now , duda and hundreds of colleagues – mostly volunteers who have taken vacation time from their day jobs to help – have been working in dresden filling sandbags and stacking them in order to save landmarks , streets and homes from the rising elbe river .
on friday morning , officials confirmed that the elbe broke the 8.77 meter mark -lrb- 28.7 feet -rrb- set by the record floods of 1845 , when it rose to 9 meters -lrb- 29.5 feet -rrb- .
water levels in the summer tend to average about 2 meters .
more than 1,500 thw workers from 150 regional offices have been deployed to aid in flood relief efforts across the states of saxony and bavaria , where flooding has been the worst so far .
though natural disaster management is usually the role of states , the national thw can also be dispatched in times of crisis .
locals pitch in to save their city duda says they 've received a generous amount of help from dresden locals .
he says people have been showing up with shovels to help fill sandbags , and that even those whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by the floods have come out to help their friends and neighbors .
" people are coming by and asking , ' what can i do ?
how can i help ?
where do you need us to go ? " he said . for many flood victims , helping out serves as a diversion from a tragedy that has affected them personally .
" it 's important for them , and everybody , to build a sense of community right now .
these people suffer a little less knowing that their neighbors and other residents are helping out , " duda said .
volunteers are busy doing everything they can to secure homes in the area by sandbagging doors and windows or covering them with hardwood boards and plastic sheeting .
sandbags are also being piled up in the streets to keep floodwaters from reaching places that have n't already been overrun .
currently , he says , the thw has plenty of people on the scene , working in shifts with a few hours of rest in between , doing all they can to prevent the worst .
but when you 're dealing with nature , no amount of prevention can provide certainty , and duda says he fears the worst is yet to come .
" we 're just going to have to wait and see now how the water climbs .
the danger is definitely still there , " he warns .
red cross coordinates relief during " chaos " meanwhile , in a drier part of dresden , beate lowke spends her day answering a phone that never seems to stop ringing .
a worker for the dresden chapter of the red cross , lowke is helping organize volunteers and collect donations for the relief effort .
lowke notes that the city is at alarm level four , the absolute highest for dresden in a natural disaster .
virtually every organization has a hand in the aid effort – all of the city 's emergency personnel and volunteers have been called to duty , including the all-volunteer staff of the red cross .
lowke says the red cross has been inundated with so many phone calls and people showing up at the door to help that they do n't even know what to do with them .
" the conditions are a bit chaotic right now , " she says .
" but the people of dresden are outstanding – they all want to help .
i 'm totally overwhelmed . "
the charitable organization is preparing to distribute money , clean clothing and necessities to those hardest hit by the floods and she expect the first major wave of flood victims on friday .
in addition to the relief supplies the red cross has already collected , german department stores are also contributing goods , she said .
lowke said flood victims are most in need of t-shirts , socks , warm clothing , hygiene articles , water , food , flashlights , batteries , and , for a city covered several-meters deep in water and mud , rubber boots .
but workers at the red cross are lucky compared to other relief foot soldiers in dresden .
" i 'm sitting in my dry office and came to work just like normal today , " lowke says .
" if we were n't watching television , we might not know what was going on .
but i still do n't know how i 'm going to get home tonight .
there 's only one bridge still open over the elbe , and it could already be covered with water now . "
hard to describe the emotional damage it 's safe to say that no one back at the front lines near the elbe feels removed from the tangible impact of the flooding .
duda of the thk is still tirelessly filling sandbags at the water ’ s edge .
he reflects on the magnitude of the disaster , one of the many he ’ s seen in his 14 years working for the relief agency .
" i 've been on a lot of foreign missions that were worse than this , " he says .
" last year , i was in el salvador after the earthquakes and also other tragedies that were considerably worse .
still , it 's very hard to describe the emotional feeling one has when you see people sitting in front of their homes with resignation , watching as the water comes closer and closer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.08.2002 relieving job angst through temp work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of temporary workers in germany work in the electronics or metal industries .
a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .
" slave traders " no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arbeitslose warten vor einem arbeitsamt in berlin auf diesem archivbild vom 4 .
maerz 1998 .
die zahl der arbeitslosen ist im september 2001 ueber den vorjahresstand gestiegen , wie die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit am dienstag , 9 .
oktober 2001 , in nuernberg erklaerte .
die arbeitslosenquote liegt bei 9,0 prozent .
bundesweit gab es 3 , 743 millionen arbeitslose , 58.200 mehr als vor einem jahr und 45.800 weniger als im august 2001 .
-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .

hartz hat am samstag , 3 .
aug .
2002 davor gewarnt seine vorschlaege zur reform der arbeitsvermittlung im wahlkampf zu zerreiben .
laut dem reformentwurf soll die bundesanstalt fuer arbeit teilprivatisiert werden und sich auf kernaufgaben beschraenken .
nicht mehr zu den aufgaben der behoerde sollen etwa die auszahlung des kindergeldes oder die bekaempfung der illegalen beschaeftigung gehoeren .
in fact , it would have been hard for the unions not to give temping a second chance .
the proposals by the hartz commission that have shone new light on the industry came not from conservative voices unfriendly to unions , but from peter hartz , close friend of social democrat gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is a close friend of the unions .
“ for the first time , the question of temporary work it being accepted – even by the trade unions – and this consensus represents a breakthrough that could lead to reform , ” manfred weiss , professor of labor law at frankfurt ’ s goethe university said in an interview with the christian science monitor .
katja hartmann of manpower sees a bright future for her industry in germany .
while germany ’ s more than 3,000 temp agencies employ 800,000 people now , she thinks that number will soon go up , especially if the hartz commission proposals are adopted .
she said old ideas about temporary work are on the way out .
“ people should realize that no country protects their temps more than germany does and they ’ re starting to understand that having a job for life is really a thing of the past , ” she said .
“ those kinds of jobs just aren ’ t there anymore . ” kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unemployment rains on schröder 's parade the latest unemployment figures for germany show a further rise , especially in the east .

dresden is experiencing its worst flooding in 150 years . german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on thursday that the federal government would begin transferring the first 100 million euros -lrb- $ 97.8 million -rrb- of a 385 million euro -lrb- $ 377.6 million -rrb- emergency flood relief package for the flooded eastern and southern parts of the country . the first money will be available on friday , schröder said at a berlin press conference .
considering the “ catastrophic extent of the damages , ” however , this may up being just a preliminary measure , he said . while the overflowing vltava river in prague began subsiding on thursday , dresden was bracing for worsening conditions as the elbe river continued to rise .
on friday morning , officials said the river crossed the 9 meter mark , breaking the 8.77 meter mark set by the record floods in the city in 1845 . much of central dresden and neighboring smaller towns along the elbe stood under water on thursday .
several hundred hospital patients have been evacuated to other towns and the german army has sent a medevac jet to the area in case further medical evacuations are necessary . 20,000 to be evacuated by saturday officials say that at least 10 people have died in germany this week from of flood-related causes .
and an estimated 20,000 people will be evacuated from their homes in flood-stricken areas of the country by saturday . “ it will take a major national effort to repair the damage caused , ” said schröder after visiting saxony to inspect the flood damage .
“ the whole nation will have to help . ” the emergency relief plan approved by the federal government on wednesday calls for , among other things , the creation of a credit program with subsidized interest rates ; 25 million euros -lrb- $ 24.5 million -rrb- for infrastructure damage ; and the creation of a 50 million euro -lrb- $ 49 million -rrb- program that would give 5,000 unemployed germans flood clean-up jobs . hamburg braces for possible flooding the flooding is far from over in germany .
in hamburg , several hundred kilometers to the north of dresden , police and firefighters are preparing for floods , which officials believe could hit the harbor city by the middle of next week . german politicians in brussels have appealed to the european union for assistance with the flood relief effort , which is expected to cost billions of euros .
but the eu , which eliminated its budget for natural catastrophes several years ago , has told politicians from central and eastern europe not to expect much in the way of assistance . an estimated 21.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.2 billion -rrb- earmarked for regional development programs could be reappropriated , the eu said .
but more funding will be hard to come by . the german red cross , meanwhile , announced a 1 million euro emergency flood relief program . while the economic fallout from this week ’ s flooding is still being tallied , political observers said the catastrophe is doing wonders for schröder ’ s re-election effort . opportunity for schröder “ schröder has been handed a golden opportunity to present himself as a crisis manager , ” dietmar herz , political scientist at erfurt university told reuters .
“ the public tends to rally around their leaders in times of crises .
schröder got a chance to show what he can do . ” opposition candidate edmund stoiber has come under criticism this week because he only briefly interrupted his vacation to visit flood-affected areas in his home state of bavaria . other european countries continued their own flood-fighting efforts on thursday .

dresden is experiencing its worst flooding in 150 years . german chancellor gerhard schröder announced on thursday that the federal government would begin transferring the first 100 million euros -lrb- $ 97.8 million -rrb- of a 385 million euro -lrb- $ 377.6 million -rrb- emergency flood relief package for the flooded eastern and southern parts of the country . the first money will be available on friday , schröder said at a berlin press conference .
considering the “ catastrophic extent of the damages , ” however , this may up being just a preliminary measure , he said . while the overflowing vltava river in prague began subsiding on thursday , dresden was bracing for worsening conditions as the elbe river continued to rise .
on friday morning , officials said the river crossed the 9 meter mark , breaking the 8.77 meter mark set by the record floods in the city in 1845 . much of central dresden and neighboring smaller towns along the elbe stood under water on thursday .
several hundred hospital patients have been evacuated to other towns and the german army has sent a medevac jet to the area in case further medical evacuations are necessary . 20,000 to be evacuated by saturday officials say that at least 10 people have died in germany this week from of flood-related causes .
and an estimated 20,000 people will be evacuated from their homes in flood-stricken areas of the country by saturday . “ it will take a major national effort to repair the damage caused , ” said schröder after visiting saxony to inspect the flood damage .
“ the whole nation will have to help . ” the emergency relief plan approved by the federal government on wednesday calls for , among other things , the creation of a credit program with subsidized interest rates ; 25 million euros -lrb- $ 24.5 million -rrb- for infrastructure damage ; and the creation of a 50 million euro -lrb- $ 49 million -rrb- program that would give 5,000 unemployed germans flood clean-up jobs . hamburg braces for possible flooding the flooding is far from over in germany .
in hamburg , several hundred kilometers to the north of dresden , police and firefighters are preparing for floods , which officials believe could hit the harbor city by the middle of next week . german politicians in brussels have appealed to the european union for assistance with the flood relief effort , which is expected to cost billions of euros .
but the eu , which eliminated its budget for natural catastrophes several years ago , has told politicians from central and eastern europe not to expect much in the way of assistance . an estimated 21.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 21.2 billion -rrb- earmarked for regional development programs could be reappropriated , the eu said .
but more funding will be hard to come by . the german red cross , meanwhile , announced a 1 million euro emergency flood relief program . while the economic fallout from this week ’ s flooding is still being tallied , political observers said the catastrophe is doing wonders for schröder ’ s re-election effort . opportunity for schröder “ schröder has been handed a golden opportunity to present himself as a crisis manager , ” dietmar herz , political scientist at erfurt university told reuters .
“ the public tends to rally around their leaders in times of crises .
schröder got a chance to show what he can do . ” opposition candidate edmund stoiber has come under criticism this week because he only briefly interrupted his vacation to visit flood-affected areas in his home state of bavaria . other european countries continued their own flood-fighting efforts on thursday .

a government-appointed commission assigned to come up with ways to fight germany ’ s unemployment wants to encourage temp work .
it ’ s a tough sell to a populace more accustomed to the idea of a job for life . it used to be easy in germany – you went to school , got a job , and were usually set for life .
working for one company for thirty or forty years was common and the security that went with it lay close to the german heart .
but that kind of job security is a thing of the past .
today , germany is struggling with four million unemployed , a languishing economy and wave after wave of insolvencies and layoff announcements .
the government is scrambling for new strategies to put its citizens back to work . one of those , released last week by the hartz commission , a 15-member panel appointed to suggest labor reforms , wants to put new emphasis on temporary work .
it ’ s a concept that goes deeply against the german grain .
“ we ’ re very sceptical when it comes to temporary work , ” johannes jakob of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- told dw-world , expressing the traditional view of the country ’ s powerful trade union movement and many germans .
“ it can be misused by employers , especially to lower wages .
it leaves the worker unprotected . ”
thrown among the wolves to germans , who are used to a level of job protection the rest of the world can only dream about , being farmed out by a temp agency to a strange company is something akin to being thrown out of the boat without a life preserver .
critics argue it ’ s pure exploitation , citing the fact that temporary employees don ’ t necessarily receive the same wages as the permanently-employed colleagues they might be working alongside .
a study by the dgb in 2001 said that temp workers on average received 40 percent less than those with equal qualifications in permanent positions .
other black marks against the temp industry , according to the unions , are high levels of job insecurity among temps , greater frequency of on-the-job injuries , and lower overall contributions to the germany ’ s social security system , which is already under strain .
critics argue further that temp work embodies the “ hire and fire ” principle , accepted in liberal economies like the us and britain , and traditionally anathema in germany .
this widespread opposition to temping has meant that the industry has been more regulated in germany than elsewhere .
in its temporary work law of 1972 , the government restricted temp assignments to less than seven months .
this year that limit has been extended to 24 months – still far less than what is allowed in britain or the netherlands .

-lrb- ap photo / hans edinger -rrb- but with four million unemployed and no relief in sight , temp work has emerged as a possible tool in the fight against joblessness , and it ’ s starting to overcome some of its bad reputation , even among die-hard opponents .
“ there are still vestiges of the old mentality against temporary work here .
germany has a harder time getting rid of them than other countries , it seems , ” katja hartmann , marketing manager with manpower , an american temporary agency with operations in germany , told dw-world .
“ but attitudes have changed dramatically over the last few months . ”
the media coverage of the hartz commission proposals encouraging expansion of the temporary sector have gone a long way , hartmann said .
she said people are seeing temp agencies less as “ slave traders ” and more as possible job creators . according to a study by the mckinsey consulting firm , temping could create up to 4 million new jobs in europe by 2010 , with the biggest potential for job growth in germany .
in addition , temping has a good track record in several other european countries .
in britain and the netherlands , the countries with europe ’ s lowest jobless rates , temp workers represent 3.7 and 4.5 percent of the workforce respectively .
that ’ s in stark contrast with germany , the country with europe ’ s largest percentage of long-term unemployed , where temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce .
besides fueling job growth , temporary agencies have proved effective at putting unemployed workers back into the labor force , funnelling some 30 percent of their workers annually into full-time jobs .
“ that means turning unemployment into employment , and it doesn ’ t cost the taxpayer a cent , ” gert denkhaus with the federal association of temporary work agencies told dw-world .
according to him , temp work can be a springboard to employment for traditionally hard-to-employ groups , like low-skilled laborers , older workers , mothers wanting to reenter the workforce and students .
half of those who go to work through temp agencies , he said , were unemployed before .
unions coming around ?
given all the good news around temping and the bad news about unemployment , even the unions have begun to rethink their long-held opposition .
“ temporary work is one instrument , a small one , to fight unemployment , ” said johannes jakob of the trade union federation .
“ but it must be regulated in the interests of employees , ” he was quick to add .

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”
the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union , want to address germany ’ s unemployment problems primarily through tax and social security reforms . industry leaders also had their reservations .
michael rogowski , head of the federation of german industries , said “ there ’ s really no grounds to celebrate the proposals ” and that some of the proposals could lead to lasting state involvement in the labor market . germany ’ s chambers of commerce association , dihk , called the proposals an “ important step , but no breakthrough . ”
it criticized the decision to scrap possible general cuts in unemployment benefits to motivate people to accept jobs offered to them .
although initially considered , the proposal was dropped under pressure from the trade unions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .

the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”
the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union , want to address germany ’ s unemployment problems primarily through tax and social security reforms . industry leaders also had their reservations .
michael rogowski , head of the federation of german industries , said “ there ’ s really no grounds to celebrate the proposals ” and that some of the proposals could lead to lasting state involvement in the labor market . germany ’ s chambers of commerce association , dihk , called the proposals an “ important step , but no breakthrough . ”
it criticized the decision to scrap possible general cuts in unemployment benefits to motivate people to accept jobs offered to them .

a debate at cologne ’ s pop komm music conference brought industry experts together to discuss the implications arising from the influx of manufactured pop personalities on , well , other manufactured pop personalities . the title of the discussion , ' u2 would not be possible today ' , said it all .
on thursday afternoon , record executives and industry experts gathered at the 14th annual popkomm music trade fair in cologne to discuss why .
in the spotlight were the record executives responsible for boy bands like ' nsync and the backstreet boys , the former head of a pioneering hip hop label , an artist and repertoire -lrb- a & r -rrb- executive from warner in germany and the editor of music week uk .
these experts were brought together to debate the reasons why some bands are not being developed and if success stories like u2 's rise to fame can even be duplicated in today 's climate .
under chandeliers in an auditorium on cologne 's trade fair grounds , the real question was about money .
is it possible , in today 's music industry climate , to nurture and invest in an organically formed band 's long term future ?
there were many differing opinions but the general consensus was ' no ' .
this opinion has never had such a ring to it as it has in these days of ‘ pop stars ’ and ‘ pop idol ’ , the television shows that take ordinary , every day folk and create singing stars .
manufactured bands have been with us ever since the monkees started the trend in the sixties .
every decade has had its defining plastic pop group .
the scrapyard of teenage fancy is littered with names such as new kids on the block , take that and the spice girls .
one man who has played a hugely influential part in the more recent manufactured band phenomenon is louis pearlman , the head honcho at transcontinental records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from disney club to world domination , care of lou pearlman .
his team has been responsible for putting together boy bands backstreet boys and ' n sync and guiding a youngster called britney spears towards superstardom .
he is currently pushing new bands o-town and natural in germany , the country who gave backstreet boys their first gold discs thanks to enthusiastic air play .
financial risks holding back new acts pearlman believes that talented bands are not being promoted because the immense amount of money needed to get a group off the ground and into the charts .
and he should know .
pearlman spent 1.5 million euro -lrb- $ 1.47 million -rrb- on the backstreet boys before they even got a sniff of a record deal .
luckily the gamble paid off .
executives nowadays are n't as bold .
the reason is something tom silverman , founder of the seminal hip-hop label tommy boy records and man responsible for the rise of artists de la soul , queen latifah and coolio , calls the ' risk / reward factor ' .
speaking from the pop komm stage , silverman said , " it 'll cost you two and half million dollars to take an act all the way and even if they make it , the reward has to be higher than your costs . "
" look at puff daddy .
he lost his deal with bad boy records even though he sold a million copies of his album .
it did n't make a profit . "
silverman sold his shares in tommy boy to aol time warner before taking up a position as head of an independently minded subsidiary of his former empire . he plans to open a distribution centre in germany that will serve europe . it 's a business markus bruns , an a & r man from warner music group in germany , defended the policies of the big companies .
" our target is to make money .
if you want to invest everything in development , it wo n't work .
if you want to invest everything in marketing , it wo n't work .
you need balance between risk and reward . "
tom silverman offered a ray of hope to the bands that struggle against this ratio . " if you want to take a chance and want a band to succeed , you should say , ' that video will not cost fifty thousand dollars , you 're going to make it for ten , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' popstars ' winners no angels are a product of television as a marketing tool .
for lou pearlman , however , the future already seems bright .
he 's invested heavily in his ' pop stars ' and ' pop idol ' concepts and german winners no angels and bro 'sis are currently climbing up into the pop big leagues , thanks to the programmes ' popularity along with clever marketing .
tv is crucial " you need television to break an artist and specific types of music need television and the media .
having your act on tv cuts the risk and ups the reward , " pearlman said .
moderator ajax scott of music week uk challenged the panel by asking if the plastic band phenomenon was a destabilising , momentary trend and if a new u2 would eclipse the backstreet boys of the future .
lou pearlman summed it up : " people ask me when boy bands will be over .

a debate at cologne ’ s pop komm music conference brought industry experts together to discuss the implications arising from the influx of manufactured pop personalities on , well , other manufactured pop personalities . the title of the discussion , ' u2 would not be possible today ' , said it all .
on thursday afternoon , record executives and industry experts gathered at the 14th annual popkomm music trade fair in cologne to discuss why .
in the spotlight were the record executives responsible for boy bands like ' nsync and the backstreet boys , the former head of a pioneering hip hop label , an artist and repertoire -lrb- a & r -rrb- executive from warner in germany and the editor of music week uk .
these experts were brought together to debate the reasons why some bands are not being developed and if success stories like u2 's rise to fame can even be duplicated in today 's climate .
under chandeliers in an auditorium on cologne 's trade fair grounds , the real question was about money .
is it possible , in today 's music industry climate , to nurture and invest in an organically formed band 's long term future ?
there were many differing opinions but the general consensus was ' no ' .
this opinion has never had such a ring to it as it has in these days of ‘ pop stars ’ and ‘ pop idol ’ , the television shows that take ordinary , every day folk and create singing stars .
manufactured bands have been with us ever since the monkees started the trend in the sixties .
every decade has had its defining plastic pop group .
the scrapyard of teenage fancy is littered with names such as new kids on the block , take that and the spice girls .
one man who has played a hugely influential part in the more recent manufactured band phenomenon is louis pearlman , the head honcho at transcontinental records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from disney club to world domination , care of lou pearlman .
his team has been responsible for putting together boy bands backstreet boys and ' n sync and guiding a youngster called britney spears towards superstardom .
he is currently pushing new bands o-town and natural in germany , the country who gave backstreet boys their first gold discs thanks to enthusiastic air play .
financial risks holding back new acts pearlman believes that talented bands are not being promoted because the immense amount of money needed to get a group off the ground and into the charts .
and he should know .
pearlman spent 1.5 million euro -lrb- $ 1.47 million -rrb- on the backstreet boys before they even got a sniff of a record deal .
luckily the gamble paid off .
executives nowadays are n't as bold .
the reason is something tom silverman , founder of the seminal hip-hop label tommy boy records and man responsible for the rise of artists de la soul , queen latifah and coolio , calls the ' risk / reward factor ' .
speaking from the pop komm stage , silverman said , " it 'll cost you two and half million dollars to take an act all the way and even if they make it , the reward has to be higher than your costs . "
" look at puff daddy .
he lost his deal with bad boy records even though he sold a million copies of his album .
it did n't make a profit . "
silverman sold his shares in tommy boy to aol time warner before taking up a position as head of an independently minded subsidiary of his former empire . he plans to open a distribution centre in germany that will serve europe . it 's a business markus bruns , an a & r man from warner music group in germany , defended the policies of the big companies .
" our target is to make money .
if you want to invest everything in development , it wo n't work .
if you want to invest everything in marketing , it wo n't work .
you need balance between risk and reward . "
tom silverman offered a ray of hope to the bands that struggle against this ratio . " if you want to take a chance and want a band to succeed , you should say , ' that video will not cost fifty thousand dollars , you 're going to make it for ten , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' popstars ' winners no angels are a product of television as a marketing tool .
for lou pearlman , however , the future already seems bright .
he 's invested heavily in his ' pop stars ' and ' pop idol ' concepts and german winners no angels and bro 'sis are currently climbing up into the pop big leagues , thanks to the programmes ' popularity along with clever marketing .
tv is crucial " you need television to break an artist and specific types of music need television and the media .
having your act on tv cuts the risk and ups the reward , " pearlman said .
moderator ajax scott of music week uk challenged the panel by asking if the plastic band phenomenon was a destabilising , momentary trend and if a new u2 would eclipse the backstreet boys of the future .
lou pearlman summed it up : " people ask me when boy bands will be over .

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .

a debate at cologne ’ s pop komm music conference brought industry experts together to discuss the implications arising from the influx of manufactured pop personalities on , well , other manufactured pop personalities . the title of the discussion , ' u2 would not be possible today ' , said it all .
on thursday afternoon , record executives and industry experts gathered at the 14th annual popkomm music trade fair in cologne to discuss why .
in the spotlight were the record executives responsible for boy bands like ' nsync and the backstreet boys , the former head of a pioneering hip hop label , an artist and repertoire -lrb- a & r -rrb- executive from warner in germany and the editor of music week uk .
these experts were brought together to debate the reasons why some bands are not being developed and if success stories like u2 's rise to fame can even be duplicated in today 's climate .
under chandeliers in an auditorium on cologne 's trade fair grounds , the real question was about money .
is it possible , in today 's music industry climate , to nurture and invest in an organically formed band 's long term future ?
there were many differing opinions but the general consensus was ' no ' .
this opinion has never had such a ring to it as it has in these days of ‘ pop stars ’ and ‘ pop idol ’ , the television shows that take ordinary , every day folk and create singing stars .
manufactured bands have been with us ever since the monkees started the trend in the sixties .
every decade has had its defining plastic pop group .
the scrapyard of teenage fancy is littered with names such as new kids on the block , take that and the spice girls .
one man who has played a hugely influential part in the more recent manufactured band phenomenon is louis pearlman , the head honcho at transcontinental records .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from disney club to world domination , care of lou pearlman .
his team has been responsible for putting together boy bands backstreet boys and ' n sync and guiding a youngster called britney spears towards superstardom .
he is currently pushing new bands o-town and natural in germany , the country who gave backstreet boys their first gold discs thanks to enthusiastic air play .
financial risks holding back new acts pearlman believes that talented bands are not being promoted because the immense amount of money needed to get a group off the ground and into the charts .
and he should know .
pearlman spent 1.5 million euro -lrb- $ 1.47 million -rrb- on the backstreet boys before they even got a sniff of a record deal .
luckily the gamble paid off .
executives nowadays are n't as bold .
the reason is something tom silverman , founder of the seminal hip-hop label tommy boy records and man responsible for the rise of artists de la soul , queen latifah and coolio , calls the ' risk / reward factor ' .
speaking from the pop komm stage , silverman said , " it 'll cost you two and half million dollars to take an act all the way and even if they make it , the reward has to be higher than your costs . "
" look at puff daddy .
he lost his deal with bad boy records even though he sold a million copies of his album .
it did n't make a profit . "
silverman sold his shares in tommy boy to aol time warner before taking up a position as head of an independently minded subsidiary of his former empire . he plans to open a distribution centre in germany that will serve europe . it 's a business markus bruns , an a & r man from warner music group in germany , defended the policies of the big companies .
" our target is to make money .
if you want to invest everything in development , it wo n't work .
if you want to invest everything in marketing , it wo n't work .
you need balance between risk and reward . "
tom silverman offered a ray of hope to the bands that struggle against this ratio . " if you want to take a chance and want a band to succeed , you should say , ' that video will not cost fifty thousand dollars , you 're going to make it for ten , " he said .

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”
the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union , want to address germany ’ s unemployment problems primarily through tax and social security reforms . industry leaders also had their reservations .

unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”
the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union , want to address germany ’ s unemployment problems primarily through tax and social security reforms . industry leaders also had their reservations .
michael rogowski , head of the federation of german industries , said “ there ’ s really no grounds to celebrate the proposals ” and that some of the proposals could lead to lasting state involvement in the labor market . germany ’ s chambers of commerce association , dihk , called the proposals an “ important step , but no breakthrough . ”
it criticized the decision to scrap possible general cuts in unemployment benefits to motivate people to accept jobs offered to them .
although initially considered , the proposal was dropped under pressure from the trade unions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .

a debate at cologne ’ s pop komm music conference brought industry experts together to discuss the implications arising from the influx of manufactured pop personalities on , well , other manufactured pop personalities . the title of the discussion , ' u2 would not be possible today ' , said it all .
on thursday afternoon , record executives and industry experts gathered at the 14th annual popkomm music trade fair in cologne to discuss why .
in the spotlight were the record executives responsible for boy bands like ' nsync and the backstreet boys , the former head of a pioneering hip hop label , an artist and repertoire -lrb- a & r -rrb- executive from warner in germany and the editor of music week uk .
these experts were brought together to debate the reasons why some bands are not being developed and if success stories like u2 's rise to fame can even be duplicated in today 's climate .
under chandeliers in an auditorium on cologne 's trade fair grounds , the real question was about money .
is it possible , in today 's music industry climate , to nurture and invest in an organically formed band 's long term future ?
there were many differing opinions but the general consensus was ' no ' .
this opinion has never had such a ring to it as it has in these days of ‘ pop stars ’ and ‘ pop idol ’ , the television shows that take ordinary , every day folk and create singing stars .
manufactured bands have been with us ever since the monkees started the trend in the sixties .
every decade has had its defining plastic pop group .

pearlman spent 1.5 million euro -lrb- $ 1.47 million -rrb- on the backstreet boys before they even got a sniff of a record deal .
luckily the gamble paid off .
executives nowadays are n't as bold .
the reason is something tom silverman , founder of the seminal hip-hop label tommy boy records and man responsible for the rise of artists de la soul , queen latifah and coolio , calls the ' risk / reward factor ' .
speaking from the pop komm stage , silverman said , " it 'll cost you two and half million dollars to take an act all the way and even if they make it , the reward has to be higher than your costs . "
" look at puff daddy .
he lost his deal with bad boy records even though he sold a million copies of his album .

" our target is to make money .

tom silverman offered a ray of hope to the bands that struggle against this ratio . " if you want to take a chance and want a band to succeed , you should say , ' that video will not cost fifty thousand dollars , you 're going to make it for ten , " he said .

a commission studying german labor market reform has presented gerhard schröder recommendations for halving the country ’ s unemployment rate .
the german leader hopes the measures can help him win reelection in september . on friday , peter hartz , volkswagen personnel chief and head of the commission that bears his name , handed a cd to chancellor gerhard schröder before 500 guests and journalists at berlin ’ s french cathedral .
it wasn ’ t a digital bible , rather 343 pages of proposals for reforming german ’ s highly regulated labour market and putting many of the country ’ s four million unemployed back to work . still , schröder must be hoping it can work miracles , and give him the badly needed boost in the opinion polls he needs to catch up with his challenger before next month ’ s parlimentary elections . in a nutshell , the key points of the hartz commission proposals are as follows : job centers : germany ’ s 181 labor offices to change their names to a friendlier-sounding “ job centers ” and become one-stop-shops for the jobless .
new emphasis to be put on finding jobs for the unemployed rather than managing unemployment . more pressure on unemployed : people who have been fired or who know they ’ re about to be laid off to register immediately with local labor offices .
people who refuse to take jobs offered to them face possible cuts in benefits .
no overall cuts in benefits . temporary work : the temporary work sector to be expanded .
unemployed people to be assigned to “ personal service agencies ” and be placed in temporary jobs or provided job training . mini-jobs : to promote low-income jobs , the level under which no tax and social security are paid to be raised from € 325 to € 500 for household and childcare workers . me , inc . : to legitimize germany ’ s thriving black market , unemployed people to be encouraged to incorporate themselves , income up to € 25,000 -lrb- $ 24,610 -rrb- to be taxed to a flat rate of 10 percent , instead of the current 19.9 percent . job floater : companies , especially in eastern germany , to get low-interest loans if they hire an unemployed person . the hartz commission , made up of representatives from industry , the unions , science and politics , has been working on the reform proposals for six months .
the first draft of the commission 's proposals was leaked in june , and were subject to much public debate .
last week , the commission reconvened to vote on a final version and on friday , peter hartz officially handed the proposals to the chancellor , saying that within three years , they could lower the number of unemployed in germany by two million . that ’ s music to schröder ’ s ears .
he is trailing the conservative opposition in the polls apparently because he has failed to keep his promise to bring down the nation ’ s stubborn unemployment rate , which is now hovering at around 10 percent .
on friday he said he would immediately get to work on putting the proposals into practice , even though many of the changes would require new legislation , which would not be possible to introduce before the september elections . " government failure " the opposition was quick to dismiss the proposals as election year grandstanding . “ it ’ s another example of the current government ’ s failure , ” said angela merkel of the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
“ it ’ s not a giant step , it ’ s at best a complicated little package that does not tackle the issues that will create more employment . ”
the cdu and its sister party , the christian social union , want to address germany ’ s unemployment problems primarily through tax and social security reforms . industry leaders also had their reservations .
michael rogowski , head of the federation of german industries , said “ there ’ s really no grounds to celebrate the proposals ” and that some of the proposals could lead to lasting state involvement in the labor market . germany ’ s chambers of commerce association , dihk , called the proposals an “ important step , but no breakthrough . ”
it criticized the decision to scrap possible general cuts in unemployment benefits to motivate people to accept jobs offered to them .
although initially considered , the proposal was dropped under pressure from the trade unions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder presents ' blueprint ' for labor reform the chancellor told germany ’ s parliament on thursday that he has a " blueprint " for reforming the country ’ s tangled labor market .

the judge ruled that the dog perfume - timmy holedigger - could not possibly be confused with the tommy hilfiger brand of cologne .
the judge advised the famous designer to " chill " and see the funny side .
the company that makes the dog perfume also produces other parody brands - like ck-9 and aramutts .
nature labs has been making them for three years and for much of that time it has faced legal action from the famous clothes and cologne manufacturer , tommy hilfiger .
on the scent tommy hilfiger claimed in its lawsuit that the parody product was likely to cause customer confusion .
but the judge in manhattan 's federal court disagreed and threw out the case .
he said that even a " dense and humourless consumer " could not make that mistake and he criticised the famous name for " failing to see the humour in all this " .
the judge also pointed out that other leading clothing and cologne companies had either smiled or suffered in silence when their brand names were parodied as dog perfumes .
aramis , mocked as aramutts for male dogs , or liz claiborne , humoured as miss claybone for bitches , had not sued .
and neither had ck-9 - the canine version of calvin klein 's famous scent .

kelly udall has to take a bus and four different tube trains to get to work everyday .
the 28-year-old lives in streatham , south london , but works in wapping , east of the city .
if the east london line extension was in place his journey time would be halved .
the line will be extended in the north and south to build an " m25 " on the railway - part of an orbirail strategy being developed by the strategic rail authority -lrb- sra -rrb- with transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- .
click here to see the planned northern extension local people see the extension as vital new money and jobs for some of london 's poorest areas .
but there is a stumbling block in the way in the form of a viaduct .
the project was set to go ahead when english heritage made a u-turn and said that the " needless demolition of the bishopsgate goods yard would be a conservation tragedy " .
inside the goods yard is braithwaite viaduct , built in 1839 , which is one of the earliest examples of railway engineering in the world .
the braithwaite viaduct dated back to 1839 patrick pugh , assistant director of the london region for english heritage , said : " a national survey found that the goods yard was much more important then had been previously appreciated .
" it is one of the earliest surviving railway structures in the world . "
in march this year the culture secretary tessa jowell announced the viaduct was a listed building .
many thought this could mean the end of the planned extension .
' carry railway ' but english heritage has said there is a way round the problem .
they commissioned a report from structural engineers in the hope of proving the structure was capable of still carrying rail traffic and being incorporated into the current plans .
but london underground -lrb- lu -rrb- is worried about the structure as it suffered a huge fire in the 1960s and has not had any repairs or maintenance for over 40 years .
exterior of bishopsgate goods yard a lu spokesperson said : " engineers believe that it is not safe to run a railway over these structures . "
if they can not demonstrate to the railway inspectorate that the structures are safe then " the extension would not go-ahead " .
lu said it only needs to demolish part of the goods yard and that is still the preferred option .

' limbo situation ' mr pugh said : " we want the extension as much as everyone else .
" this is a practical proposition which could keep the original structure . "
meanwhile the people who the extension is going to help are worried that it is taking too long .
a private company will finance and build the line archie galloway , chairman of the east london line group which represents leading groups in the capital in support of the extension , said it is a " limbo situation " .

the company , north east pharmaceutical group , says the product is likely to cost about a tenth of the price of imported drugs .
but doctors say even that is likely to be too expensive for the majority of china 's hiv / aids patients .
what is aids ?
click here chinese health authorities estimate that there are more than one million hiv positive people in the country .
but the true numbers are almost impossible to arrive at because many are on the margins of society - drug users , prostitutes and villagers infected by tainted blood products .
for the vast majority , the cost of imported drugs - which sell for $ 200-300 a month - is well out of reach .
still expensive the company which has for the first time been given a green light to market a chinese-made version of azt domestically is actually already making the drug for export .
but the release of the product at home may have got bogged down in the politics of china 's entry into the world trade organisation .
the chinese-made drug will sell for about one-tenth of the cost of foreign equivalents .
doctors say that will help some sufferers , even though the drug on its own is unlikely to be as effective as the cocktail of medication available to many patients in developed countries .
but for the majority of china 's hiv / aids patients , even the domestically produced drug is likely to be too expensive .
aids experts say there is all the more need to focus on preventive work .
but even in big cities such as shanghai , political sensitivities continue to get in the way of such ideas as promoting safer sex .
and while chinese experts have begun to study needle exchange projects for drug users in countries like australia , authorities have yet to approve such practices in china itself . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's francis markus " the chinese-made drug will sell for about a tenth of the cost of foreign equivalents " senator mechai viravaidya , former cabinet minister " it 's not possible for china to export it to other countries " lyndall stein , actionaid " it 's excellent news but we have to see it in the context of what else needs to be done " key stories hiv total tops 40 million e europe 's cases soar india 's hiv ' ignorance ' women hit hardest case studies hiv and malawi famine uk hiv at record high ' my aids test fears ' chinese mother 's grief background what is aids ?

the company points out it is closing other shops - about 60 over the next two years - and is now focusing on other parts of japan , outside of the urban centres like tokyo and osaka .

the company opened its first four stores in the uk last year , and plans to open 50 stores within the next three years .
uniqlo operates 500 stores across japan .

"
i hope this wo n't be a matter of great dispute " oliver letwin although the government is already considering the measure , the shadow home secretary , oliver letwin , says he believes the case for new legislation has already been made .
he also wants increased penalties for paedophiles who refuse to unlock encrypted information being stored on the internet .
a home office task force is currently considering new legislation to protect children from paedophiles who try to contact them in person , on the phone or via the internet .
' precipitating action ' so far the government has not said if or when this might be introduced but it could form part of a much wider review of the laws on sexual offences , which could result in new legislation in the next parliamentary session .
but mr letwin , said a new offence of internet grooming should be introduced immediately .
parents should also have the right to get an injunction in the courts if they think an adult is using the internet to contact a child to entice them into sex , he said .
" even if the police do uncover such actions , in themselves they are not presently illegal , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
so although abduction was illegal , the actions that might lead up to it were not , he added .
mr letwin admitted policing the internet was difficult but he said " some things can be done quite quickly and what we are trying to do is precipitate action " .
he added : " i hope this wo n't be a matter of great dispute and we can move quickly on this . "
the tories would be coming up with further proposals in september , he said .
fears unfounded the case of missing 10-year-olds holly wells and jessica chapman has brought the issue of paedophiles contacting children through chatrooms back to the fore .
it was feared the cambridgeshire schoolgirls had been lured to meet someone who had befriended them on the net .
police now believe this is not the case , after an analysis of holly 's pc showed the pair had not been in a chatroom on the day of their disappearance .
lure however , police and child protection organisations say it is all too easy for a paedophile to enter a chatroom , often posing as a teenager , and win a youngster 's confidence .
they then suggest a face to face meeting .
in the past two years , at least 12 children have been sexually assaulted by people who first contacted them via the internet .
although their attackers were sent to prison , child protection campaigners say the law needs strengthening .

the board of nasdaq japan voted to cease operations , following days of speculation that the end was in sight for the three year old venture .
nasdaq japan was originally launched at the height of the share boom in 1999 as part of the parent company 's hopes to create a 24-hour global market .
the nasdaq dream was that investors could trade stocks listed on its exchange in any currency at any time of day or night .
nasdaq japan operated as a part of the osaka exchange " we 're withdrawing from japan , " john hilley , chairman and chief executive of nasdaq international said . "
nasdaq japan is ceasing its operations . "
shattered dreams " the story of japan is bad timing and bad market conditions , " he added .
nasdaq was still committed to its european ventures and hoped one day to operate a global exchange , he added .
at the height of the dot.com fever , many exchanges dreamed of forming part of or dominating a truly global exchange .
many alliances were forged and dismantled .
nasdaq 's admission of even temporary defeat in its ambition highlights the fact that a truly global exchange is still some years away .
nasdaq japan operates as a section of the osaka stock exchange -lrb- ose -rrb- , japan 's second largest exchange .
stocks listed on the defunct nasdaq japan market will continue to be traded on this exchange .
the ose has said it has initial plans to rename the market the " japan new market " and continue its operation .
nasdaq japan trades the shares of 98 start-up companies .
nasdaq owns 43 % of the company , with another 43 % owned by japanese hi-tech investment firm softbank .
last week , nasdaq said it was taking a $ 10.3m charge on its investment in japan , sparking speculation the end was nigh .

lawyer allan gerson , who also worked on a lawsuit for families of victims of the 1988 pan am airline lockerbie bombing , said that the suit was aimed at uncovering the complicated financial transactions which funded the 11 september attacks .
" we 're trying to expose the extent , the depth , the orchestration , the financial support that terrorist organisations have received for perhaps a decade from various saudi interests . "

the boy from tupelo , mississippi was , contrary to appearances , nearly penniless at his death and had to tour constantly to pay his enormous bills .
now the man has made an amazing posthumous comeback , with a little less conversation recently going to number one in 22 countries . "
he had that amazing voice - which was sexy for women but reached guys as well " doug flett , songwriter his music is being used in the latest disney film lilo and stitch , and there are rumours that another remix , burning love , will be released in september .
music journalist karl dallas , who wrote for melody maker for almost the whole of elvis 's career , told bbc news online he was not surprised by the king 's enduring appeal .
" elvis had something which was both unique and very ordinary .
" he was n't a manufactured product which all of the pop stars today - even the best ones - tend to be .
" what came through was his reality , his authenticity - he was very much himself , doing what he wanted to do and not being pre-packaged by a big record company . "
elvis first hit on his winning formula , a unique stew of country , blues and rock 'n'roll , while messing around in the sun records studio in 1954 on a version of that 's all right mama .
but unlike many of his generation he was also able to sing ballads , show tunes and gospel convincingly .
and like all great singers , he made each song he sang his own .
" it has that authenticity , that feeling that this is a real experience being communicated by a real person who moved his hips on stage and sweated , " remembers karl dallas .
" there was nothing phoney about elvis , and even at his lowest point when he was recording forgettable music and making quite awful movies , there was still something that shone through . "
to music journalist charles shaar murray , the golden voice was part of an unforgettable package .
" the kind of iconic status elvis has achieved is almost independent of his actual work or his cultural achievements , " he told bbc news online .
" iconic status is an awful lot to do with how you look , and he was the prototype rock star .
" but he was also an incredibly dynamic vocalist , with an instinctive ear for finding common ground between a lot of different musics .
" the fact that he looked a certain way , dressed a certain way and moved a certain way just made it perfect . "
after the glories of his sun hits and his early rca recordings , presley went mainstream with a vengeance in the 1960s , making dozens of films for mgm and recording many inferior works .
but , charles shaar murray believes , presley still cut some great tracks in his later years .
" he made great records at two or three stages of his career - the late 1950s and late 1960s particularly .
" unfortunately he did n't really have the strength of character to pursue a musical muse outside what his management told him . "
providing some of the songs for elvis in the second half of his career was the british songwriting team of guy fletcher and doug flett .
the initial contact with elvis was a matter of luck , doug flett told bbc news online .
" in 1967 guy and i had a song in the finals of the eurovision song contest called wonderful world - our publisher heard this song , was very impressed with it and got it to elvis presley .
" it appeared in one of those dreadful mgm films the poor man was forced to make . "
but the fletcher-flett team soon got another call from presley 's management .
" we got a phone call some months later asking if we 'd care to submit a song for his next album - so we worked furiously and came up with half a dozen songs and he recorded one of them , called the fair 's moving on .
" we felt like old hands then , and the word came again to submit another song so we wrote a romantic ballad called just pretend . "
though the pair did not meet elvis , mr flett , the lyricist , said he would never forget hearing the king singing his words .
" it was thrilling , and when we heard the acetate recording - this was pre-cassette - we were stunned .
" the song fitted him like a glove - he was breaking up with priscilla at the time , so there was that behind the music as well . "
and mr flett has no doubt that it is elvis 's voice that has continued to reach hearts all around the world - 25 years after his death .
" he was exceptionally good looking , but he had that amazing voice - which was sexy for women but reached guys as well . "
" and he invented rock 'n'roll . "

our honest understanding from preliminary data is that the experiment worked allan paull project leader the scientists say data from a 10-minute test flight at the end of july at woomera in south australia indicates that supersonic combustion successfully took place .
the scramjet works by using air in the atmosphere to burn its rocket fuel rather than carrying its own oxidant - thus reducing the weight of the craft .
the project leader , allan paull , said the craft had reached 7.6 times the speed of sound .
" our honest understanding from preliminary data is that the experiment worked , " he said .
click here to see how the scramjet was tested correspondents say the scramjet raises the possibility of a flight between london and sydney in only two hours , though it is more likely to revolutionise the launch of small space payloads by dramatically lowering costs .
the hypersonic engine was strapped on to a rocket and blasted more than 300 kilometres -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- into the sky .
scientists were hoping the engine would work under its own power on its descent to earth - reaching a target speed of mach 7.6 just before hitting the ground .
having examined all the data , they now believe the experiment worked .
more efficient the first ever free flight of a scramjet was conducted by the us defense advanced research projects agency -lrb- darpa -rrb- almost a year ago .
but its conceptual engine was fired from a gun in an enclosed facility on the ground .
the university has been working on scramjets for more than 15 years this was the second time the university of queensland team had attempted to fly the small hyshot engine .
its first test last year failed when the launch rocket malfunctioned .
what was left of the hypersonic engine crashed into the desert 400 km -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- west of woomera .
the technology was first proposed in the 1950s and 60s .
scramjets are much lighter than conventional engines of equivalent power .
most of their oxidant , in the form of oxygen , comes from the atmosphere .
this is drawn into the engine , compressed and mixed explosively with a small amount of hydrogen .
however , this process only starts happening efficiently at mach 5 , which means conventional rocket technology is required to get the scramjets to their critical operating speed .
whilst much of the attention surrounding scramjets has focussed on the shorter journey times they could bring to long-haul passenger air travel , the first applications are likely to be in the space delivery business - launching small payloads , such as communications satellites , into orbit .

until last week i thought that i had sorted out my views on the way the net should develop .
i firmly believe that we need to make the internet a central part of our daily lives , and the only sensible way i can see to do that is to allow it to be regulated , managed and defined within our political system .
my argument was simple .
forget the idea of ' cyberspace ' , accept that being online is no different from being in basildon , and let the rule of law apply .
doing this will lose us some freedoms in the short-term .
but in the long-term it should allow us to put far more effective pressure on countries like china to open up to free speech , because we will not have to fight the battles separately on and offline .
it will also allow us to have a part of the net which reflects european culture and values , instead of letting us laws decide what we can and can not do online .
flawed system i still think that we need to start anchoring the online world to the real world , building national boundaries in cyberspace and allowing each state to decide its own rules and laws .
this controversial and corporate-inspired law makes it a criminal act to find a way to break any copy protection system used by copyright owners unfortunately events have conspired to make me think again about the likelihood of achieving this goal under our existing political system and with our existing politicians .
the problem is with a document published last week by the uk patent office .
it details the proposed changes to uk copyright law needed to bring it into line with the european union 's copyright directive .
the scope and extent of these changes , and the total lack of any protection for the principles of fair use of copyright material , have forced me to accept that sometimes politicians do exceptionally stupid and dangerous things , and our existing system is flawed enough to let them get away with it .
click here to tell us what you would like bill to write about next in essence , the changes update the 1988 copyright , designs and patents act to give it the same scope as the us digital millennium copyright act .
this controversial and corporate-inspired law makes it a criminal act to find a way to break any copy protection system used by copyright owners to limit the distribution of their materials .
copying dvds the best example is a small program called decss , which cracks the protection used on dvds and allows them to be played on linux computers .
copying that cd could make you a criminal decss is illegal in the us .
even linking your web page to a copy of it , held outside the us , is illegal .
at the moment using decss is also illegal in the uk , but anyone using it could argue that they were asserting their legal right to make a safe copy of copyright material , or provide access on a non-supported computer .
it is not illegal to have a copy , which is just as well as i have it on my laptop .
but under the new law these rights will go .
the direct result of this will be that we will get cds and dvds that do not play properly because of copy protection , but the contract that we make when we buy these shoddy goods will have more legal weight than our rights under copyright law .
we , the public , could also lose many of the fair use rights which were previously guaranteed to us , like the right to lend cds or dvds to our friends , or to resell them once purchased .
the companies love this , and they were the ones who lobbied the european commission so hard to get the original directive passed .
losing the battle now , whatever we may think about the new law , it is too late .
the changes being proposed to uk law are not negotiable , because all they do is implement the eu directive .
we have to start changing the system from within , by electing people who understand the net from 22 december , when they come into force , we will have lost a significant battle .
these proposals , and the blatantly corporate agenda which lay behind the original eu directive , are so appallingly bad that i have to think again about whether i really want political control of the web .
the alternative - the information anarchy of the cyber-libertarians - still seems worse .
i continue to believe we should work within the framework of law .
of course , doing this does not mean meekly accepting every legislative error made by politicians .
it means engaging with the political system instead of just standing outside it , complaining about what is being done , and trying to change things .
campaigning for change my desire to hand the net over to the politicians is still there , but i 'm now beginning to see how enormous a task it is going to be .
we should remember that the mps who will turn these proposed changes into law are elected by us and are accountable to us .
we made them , and so we have to take some responsibility for the fact that they are making a big mess of the net and copyright .
since our existing system does n't let you vote for nobody , abstaining does not let you off the hook .
we have to start changing the system from within , by electing people who understand the net , by campaigning for change , and by educating the legislators .
if every internet user who was worried by the implications of the new proposals wrote to their mp explaining why they want to keep the benefits that copyright provides and not just hand over control to the corporations , it might start to change a few minds .
at some point somebody may have to go to jail for this one , but bad laws can be repealed and better ones introduced .
in the end , i still believe in politics , and i still believe that technology should be at the service of the people , not the other way around .
for me , that means collective action by citizens through democratic institutions and i think it can be made to work .

the firm gained $ 165m -lrb- £ 108m -rrb- from the sale of its 20 % stake in the aluminerie alouette smelter in quebec .
the sale , to canadian metals giant alcan , represents " the first step " in in corus 's sale of its aluminium interests , chief executive tony pedder said .
corus was on track to complete its exit from the market by the end of the year , he added .
tough competition corus 's aluminium operations were among its best performers last year , recording an operating profit of £ 58m in a year when the company lost £ 462m .
but the firm in march revealed fears over competition in the market , and plans to begin selling its aluminium interests " immediately " .
" the pace of change in the -lsb- aluminium -rsb- industry is leaving us with fewer options to pursue a growth strategy , " mr pedder said at the time .

the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- has opened the centre in a secret location .
this centre is designed to be operational within an hour of a terrorist attack and has room for up to 300 staff . "
we realised it was key that the fsa has to be able to operate if its headquarters had been disrupted " john fryer , fsa fsa spokesman john fryer said the emergency headquarters would allow the fsa to co-ordinate the flow of information in the city , so that firms and markets could still find out what was going on in a chaotic situation .
the nerve centre will also be linked to the back-up offices at 35 of the uk 's largest banks and financial services companies .
however , the fsa says it is concerned at the lack of preparedness of smaller banks and fund management companies .
tower evacuated similar disaster management systems were put in place in the united states by banks and other financial institutions after the after 11 september attacks .
in theory , if a disaster befalls a large uk bank , the city or the fsa itself , the nerve centre could co-ordinate trading in the uk for several months .
this fsa initiative is in direct response to the attacks on new york 's world trade centre , which devastated the city 's financial district .
london 's canary wharf tower , next door to the watchdog 's offices , was evacuated on 11 september as a precaution .
" after the attack on the world trade centre we realised it was key that the fsa has to be able to operate if its headquarters had been disrupted , " says mr fryer .
previously , the fsa emergency back-up facilities had been housed within the canary wharf headquarters .
cash crisis the fsa nerve centre is also geared towards coping with less dramatic events than a terrorist strike .
for example , the nationwide failure of bank cash machines is one scenario that is being prepared for by the fsa disaster-planning team .
