democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it . a decision in the german parliament in the coming weeks will determine whether the country 's sixty million eligible voters should be able to participate directly in the political process .
on friday , parliament will begin debating whether to amend the constitution to allow for popular referenda .
a draft bill was introduced in the lower house this week by the ruling social democrat-green coalition , in response to a demand by the group ' citizens for a referendum ' .
germany has no provision for popular participation through referendum at a national level .
germans elect their parliamentary representatives , but can not vote on separate questions between elections .
democracy from below the spd / greens bill proposes to replace the top-down system with one which allows citizens to initiate and then vote in referenda on questions excepting those that concern the budget or introduction of the death penalty .
in the first stage of the process , the lower house of parliament is required to address any initiative presented by the citizenry , provided at least 400,000 signatures have been collected .
if the question is not addressed within eight months , the citizens can demand a plebiscite .
the signatures of five percent of eligible voters -lrb- approximately three million people -rrb- must be collected within six months .
once the signatures have been presented , a referendum must take place within six months , and at least twenty percent must turn out to vote .
if the question concerns an amendment to the constitution , at least forty percent have to vote .
lobbyists and loopholes while germans do have the right in principle to hold referenda , no law exists to regulate them .
citizens for a referendum says its proposal to amend the constitution could eliminate a legal loophole .
but although the group believes a majority in parliament will support the bill , it is likely to face opposition from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the bill 's oponents say the introduction of popular referenda would endanger the democratic system and threaten the parliament 's legitimacy .
they also argue that complex questions debated in the german parliament can not be reduced to a simple ' yes ' or ' no ' vote .
changing germany 's constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament , which means the bill needs the support of the cdu / csu to be passed .
ironically , if the question were put to a popular vote , the result would be a clear ' yes ' .
citizens for a referendum spokesperson claudine nierth says an overwhelming majority of the germans want to have a say in their country 's future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.06.2002 italy cracks down on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish refugees in bari , italy after denmark , italy is the next european country to pass a tough new immigration bill designed to restrict the freedom of non-eu foreigners .
opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .
while the current immigration bill still needs the final approval of the upper house , or senate , before it can become law , berlusconi and bossi are already claiming a victory over what they refer to as " the hordes invading italy ’ s shores " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country -lrb- june 3 , 2002 -rrb- radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.06.2002 german parliament considers referendum bill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the upper house of parliament in berlin , where democracy is conducted .
democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it . a decision in the german parliament in the coming weeks will determine whether the country 's sixty million eligible voters should be able to participate directly in the political process .
on friday , parliament will begin debating whether to amend the constitution to allow for popular referenda .
a draft bill was introduced in the lower house this week by the ruling social democrat-green coalition , in response to a demand by the group ' citizens for a referendum ' .
germany has no provision for popular participation through referendum at a national level .
germans elect their parliamentary representatives , but can not vote on separate questions between elections .
democracy from below the spd / greens bill proposes to replace the top-down system with one which allows citizens to initiate and then vote in referenda on questions excepting those that concern the budget or introduction of the death penalty .
in the first stage of the process , the lower house of parliament is required to address any initiative presented by the citizenry , provided at least 400,000 signatures have been collected .
if the question is not addressed within eight months , the citizens can demand a plebiscite .
the signatures of five percent of eligible voters -lrb- approximately three million people -rrb- must be collected within six months .
once the signatures have been presented , a referendum must take place within six months , and at least twenty percent must turn out to vote .
if the question concerns an amendment to the constitution , at least forty percent have to vote .
lobbyists and loopholes while germans do have the right in principle to hold referenda , no law exists to regulate them .
citizens for a referendum says its proposal to amend the constitution could eliminate a legal loophole .
but although the group believes a majority in parliament will support the bill , it is likely to face opposition from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the bill 's oponents say the introduction of popular referenda would endanger the democratic system and threaten the parliament 's legitimacy .
they also argue that complex questions debated in the german parliament can not be reduced to a simple ' yes ' or ' no ' vote .
changing germany 's constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament , which means the bill needs the support of the cdu / csu to be passed .
ironically , if the question were put to a popular vote , the result would be a clear ' yes ' .
citizens for a referendum spokesperson claudine nierth says an overwhelming majority of the germans want to have a say in their country 's future .
that 's supported by opinion polls which show more than seventy percent of people want the right to vote on important questions as well as participating in elections .
citizens for a referendum , which is an initiative of ' more democracy ' , has widespread support across germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german parliament - material on referendum bill printed materials -lrb- in german -rrb- ' more democracy ' official homepage of ' more democracy ' -lrb- in german -rrb- radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .

democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it . a decision in the german parliament in the coming weeks will determine whether the country 's sixty million eligible voters should be able to participate directly in the political process .
on friday , parliament will begin debating whether to amend the constitution to allow for popular referenda .
a draft bill was introduced in the lower house this week by the ruling social democrat-green coalition , in response to a demand by the group ' citizens for a referendum ' .
germany has no provision for popular participation through referendum at a national level .
germans elect their parliamentary representatives , but can not vote on separate questions between elections .
democracy from below the spd / greens bill proposes to replace the top-down system with one which allows citizens to initiate and then vote in referenda on questions excepting those that concern the budget or introduction of the death penalty .
in the first stage of the process , the lower house of parliament is required to address any initiative presented by the citizenry , provided at least 400,000 signatures have been collected .
if the question is not addressed within eight months , the citizens can demand a plebiscite .
the signatures of five percent of eligible voters -lrb- approximately three million people -rrb- must be collected within six months .
once the signatures have been presented , a referendum must take place within six months , and at least twenty percent must turn out to vote .
if the question concerns an amendment to the constitution , at least forty percent have to vote .
lobbyists and loopholes while germans do have the right in principle to hold referenda , no law exists to regulate them .
citizens for a referendum says its proposal to amend the constitution could eliminate a legal loophole .
but although the group believes a majority in parliament will support the bill , it is likely to face opposition from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the bill 's oponents say the introduction of popular referenda would endanger the democratic system and threaten the parliament 's legitimacy .
they also argue that complex questions debated in the german parliament can not be reduced to a simple ' yes ' or ' no ' vote .
changing germany 's constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament , which means the bill needs the support of the cdu / csu to be passed .
ironically , if the question were put to a popular vote , the result would be a clear ' yes ' .
citizens for a referendum spokesperson claudine nierth says an overwhelming majority of the germans want to have a say in their country 's future .
that 's supported by opinion polls which show more than seventy percent of people want the right to vote on important questions as well as participating in elections .
citizens for a referendum , which is an initiative of ' more democracy ' , has widespread support across germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german parliament - material on referendum bill printed materials -lrb- in german -rrb- ' more democracy ' official homepage of ' more democracy ' -lrb- in german -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the erratic currents of the galápagos archipelago carried patches of bunker fuel as far as 130km away from where the ship ran aground .
five major islands were affected by the spill .

the charles darwin foundation for the galápagos islands says that given the quantity of oil spilled , the effects could have been much worse .
good weather and the efforts of the galápagos national park service to keep the bunker fuel off the beaches meant the wildlife had a lucky escape .
iguanas unlucky but eco-physiologist at princeton university in new jersey , martin wikelski , this week published findings of research in the science journal ' nature ' which suggest some galápagos animals were n't so lucky .
wikelski 's research shows that more than sixty percent of marked iguanas on santa fe island , which was subject to contamination , have died .
adult iguanas on the island of santa fe have no natural predators and their normal cause of death is lack of food or old age .
wikelski 's team thinks that spilled oil killed microbes in the iguanas ' guts that enable the animals to digest algae , causing them to starve .
the scientists say their research shows that even low-level pollution can cause serious damage to wildlife . " our findings warn against complacency over apparently low-impact contamination after environmental disasters in other wildlife areas , " wikelski said .
still counting the cost wikelski is seeking damages of us $ 600,000 as part of a wider $ 14m claim being brought by the galápagos national park against the owners and insurers of the tanker .
the park is also seeking damages from petrocomercial , an arm of the ecuadorian state oil company which owned the oil , to cover the cost of cleaning up the spill and monitoring its effects , as well as loss of tourism and fishing revenues .
hearings in the case began in february in the high court at guayaquil , ecuador .
wikelski is claiming that the spill prevented him from conducting research on the iguanas .
the $ 600,000 represents some of the funding he and his team had received from germany 's max planck society , the university of princeton and the us national science foundation .
if he wins , wikelski says the money will be used to set up a fund for young ecuadorian scientists .

opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .
while the current immigration bill still needs the final approval of the upper house , or senate , before it can become law , berlusconi and bossi are already claiming a victory over what they refer to as " the hordes invading italy ’ s shores " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country -lrb- june 3 , 2002 -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .
while the current immigration bill still needs the final approval of the upper house , or senate , before it can become law , berlusconi and bossi are already claiming a victory over what they refer to as " the hordes invading italy ’ s shores " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country -lrb- june 3 , 2002 -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the effects of a huge oil spill in the galápagos islands last year may be much worse than earlier thought .
ecologists say the oil caused 62 percent of rare marine iguanas to starve to death . more than a year after the cargo ship ' jessica ' ran aground on a sandbank in the galápagos islands , spilling almost all of its cargo of diesel and bunker fuel into the sea , scientists say the accident has had a severe impact on the islands ' rare marine iguanas -lrb- amblyrhynchus cristatus -rrb- .
the erratic currents of the galápagos archipelago carried patches of bunker fuel as far as 130km away from where the ship ran aground .
five major islands were affected by the spill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessica ran aground near san cristóbal island on january 16 , 2001 .
the charles darwin foundation for the galápagos islands says that given the quantity of oil spilled , the effects could have been much worse .
good weather and the efforts of the galápagos national park service to keep the bunker fuel off the beaches meant the wildlife had a lucky escape .
iguanas unlucky but eco-physiologist at princeton university in new jersey , martin wikelski , this week published findings of research in the science journal ' nature ' which suggest some galápagos animals were n't so lucky .
wikelski 's research shows that more than sixty percent of marked iguanas on santa fe island , which was subject to contamination , have died .
adult iguanas on the island of santa fe have no natural predators and their normal cause of death is lack of food or old age .
wikelski 's team thinks that spilled oil killed microbes in the iguanas ' guts that enable the animals to digest algae , causing them to starve .
the scientists say their research shows that even low-level pollution can cause serious damage to wildlife . " our findings warn against complacency over apparently low-impact contamination after environmental disasters in other wildlife areas , " wikelski said .
still counting the cost wikelski is seeking damages of us $ 600,000 as part of a wider $ 14m claim being brought by the galápagos national park against the owners and insurers of the tanker .
the park is also seeking damages from petrocomercial , an arm of the ecuadorian state oil company which owned the oil , to cover the cost of cleaning up the spill and monitoring its effects , as well as loss of tourism and fishing revenues .
hearings in the case began in february in the high court at guayaquil , ecuador .
wikelski is claiming that the spill prevented him from conducting research on the iguanas .
the $ 600,000 represents some of the funding he and his team had received from germany 's max planck society , the university of princeton and the us national science foundation .

opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .
while the current immigration bill still needs the final approval of the upper house , or senate , before it can become law , berlusconi and bossi are already claiming a victory over what they refer to as " the hordes invading italy ’ s shores " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country -lrb- june 3 , 2002 -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the politician at the center of a scandal over alleged anti-semitism within the liberal free democratic party apologizes and announces the departure of the israel critic in his state group who triggered the quarrel . one day after his party 's chief gave issued an ultimatum , the free democrats ' leader in the state of north rhine-westphalia apologized on thursday for recent statements that germany 's leading jewish organization had condemned as anti-semitic .
" i have already publicly regretted these statements made in a fit of rage .
if i offended the sensibilities of jewish people in making them , i would like to apologize , " jürgen möllemann said on thursday .

the council 's head , paul spiegel , said he would would meet next week with westerwelle , but he insisted that möllemann be excluded .

karsli made the statement as he left the green party over what he described as its overly pro-israel slant and applied for fdp membership .
many inside and outside the party criticized his participation in the fdp 's state parliamentary group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.06.2002 italy cracks down on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish refugees in bari , italy after denmark , italy is the next european country to pass a tough new immigration bill designed to restrict the freedom of non-eu foreigners .
opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .
while the current immigration bill still needs the final approval of the upper house , or senate , before it can become law , berlusconi and bossi are already claiming a victory over what they refer to as " the hordes invading italy ’ s shores " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country -lrb- june 3 , 2002 -rrb- 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it . a decision in the german parliament in the coming weeks will determine whether the country 's sixty million eligible voters should be able to participate directly in the political process .
on friday , parliament will begin debating whether to amend the constitution to allow for popular referenda .
a draft bill was introduced in the lower house this week by the ruling social democrat-green coalition , in response to a demand by the group ' citizens for a referendum ' .
germany has no provision for popular participation through referendum at a national level .
germans elect their parliamentary representatives , but can not vote on separate questions between elections .
democracy from below the spd / greens bill proposes to replace the top-down system with one which allows citizens to initiate and then vote in referenda on questions excepting those that concern the budget or introduction of the death penalty .
in the first stage of the process , the lower house of parliament is required to address any initiative presented by the citizenry , provided at least 400,000 signatures have been collected .
if the question is not addressed within eight months , the citizens can demand a plebiscite .
the signatures of five percent of eligible voters -lrb- approximately three million people -rrb- must be collected within six months .
once the signatures have been presented , a referendum must take place within six months , and at least twenty percent must turn out to vote .
if the question concerns an amendment to the constitution , at least forty percent have to vote .
lobbyists and loopholes while germans do have the right in principle to hold referenda , no law exists to regulate them .
citizens for a referendum says its proposal to amend the constitution could eliminate a legal loophole .
but although the group believes a majority in parliament will support the bill , it is likely to face opposition from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the bill 's oponents say the introduction of popular referenda would endanger the democratic system and threaten the parliament 's legitimacy .
they also argue that complex questions debated in the german parliament can not be reduced to a simple ' yes ' or ' no ' vote .
changing germany 's constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament , which means the bill needs the support of the cdu / csu to be passed .
ironically , if the question were put to a popular vote , the result would be a clear ' yes ' .
citizens for a referendum spokesperson claudine nierth says an overwhelming majority of the germans want to have a say in their country 's future .
that 's supported by opinion polls which show more than seventy percent of people want the right to vote on important questions as well as participating in elections .

democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it . a decision in the german parliament in the coming weeks will determine whether the country 's sixty million eligible voters should be able to participate directly in the political process .
on friday , parliament will begin debating whether to amend the constitution to allow for popular referenda .
a draft bill was introduced in the lower house this week by the ruling social democrat-green coalition , in response to a demand by the group ' citizens for a referendum ' .
germany has no provision for popular participation through referendum at a national level .
germans elect their parliamentary representatives , but can not vote on separate questions between elections .
democracy from below the spd / greens bill proposes to replace the top-down system with one which allows citizens to initiate and then vote in referenda on questions excepting those that concern the budget or introduction of the death penalty .
in the first stage of the process , the lower house of parliament is required to address any initiative presented by the citizenry , provided at least 400,000 signatures have been collected .
if the question is not addressed within eight months , the citizens can demand a plebiscite .
the signatures of five percent of eligible voters -lrb- approximately three million people -rrb- must be collected within six months .
once the signatures have been presented , a referendum must take place within six months , and at least twenty percent must turn out to vote .
if the question concerns an amendment to the constitution , at least forty percent have to vote .
lobbyists and loopholes while germans do have the right in principle to hold referenda , no law exists to regulate them .
citizens for a referendum says its proposal to amend the constitution could eliminate a legal loophole .
but although the group believes a majority in parliament will support the bill , it is likely to face opposition from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the bill 's oponents say the introduction of popular referenda would endanger the democratic system and threaten the parliament 's legitimacy .
they also argue that complex questions debated in the german parliament can not be reduced to a simple ' yes ' or ' no ' vote .
changing germany 's constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament , which means the bill needs the support of the cdu / csu to be passed .
ironically , if the question were put to a popular vote , the result would be a clear ' yes ' .
citizens for a referendum spokesperson claudine nierth says an overwhelming majority of the germans want to have a say in their country 's future .
that 's supported by opinion polls which show more than seventy percent of people want the right to vote on important questions as well as participating in elections .

the effects of a huge oil spill in the galápagos islands last year may be much worse than earlier thought .
ecologists say the oil caused 62 percent of rare marine iguanas to starve to death . more than a year after the cargo ship ' jessica ' ran aground on a sandbank in the galápagos islands , spilling almost all of its cargo of diesel and bunker fuel into the sea , scientists say the accident has had a severe impact on the islands ' rare marine iguanas -lrb- amblyrhynchus cristatus -rrb- .
the erratic currents of the galápagos archipelago carried patches of bunker fuel as far as 130km away from where the ship ran aground .
five major islands were affected by the spill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessica ran aground near san cristóbal island on january 16 , 2001 .
the charles darwin foundation for the galápagos islands says that given the quantity of oil spilled , the effects could have been much worse .
good weather and the efforts of the galápagos national park service to keep the bunker fuel off the beaches meant the wildlife had a lucky escape .
iguanas unlucky but eco-physiologist at princeton university in new jersey , martin wikelski , this week published findings of research in the science journal ' nature ' which suggest some galápagos animals were n't so lucky .
wikelski 's research shows that more than sixty percent of marked iguanas on santa fe island , which was subject to contamination , have died .
adult iguanas on the island of santa fe have no natural predators and their normal cause of death is lack of food or old age .
wikelski 's team thinks that spilled oil killed microbes in the iguanas ' guts that enable the animals to digest algae , causing them to starve .
the scientists say their research shows that even low-level pollution can cause serious damage to wildlife . " our findings warn against complacency over apparently low-impact contamination after environmental disasters in other wildlife areas , " wikelski said .
still counting the cost wikelski is seeking damages of us $ 600,000 as part of a wider $ 14m claim being brought by the galápagos national park against the owners and insurers of the tanker .
the park is also seeking damages from petrocomercial , an arm of the ecuadorian state oil company which owned the oil , to cover the cost of cleaning up the spill and monitoring its effects , as well as loss of tourism and fishing revenues .
hearings in the case began in february in the high court at guayaquil , ecuador .
wikelski is claiming that the spill prevented him from conducting research on the iguanas .
the $ 600,000 represents some of the funding he and his team had received from germany 's max planck society , the university of princeton and the us national science foundation .
if he wins , wikelski says the money will be used to set up a fund for young ecuadorian scientists .
the galápagos islands ' unique flora and fauna inspired charles darwin to write ' on the origin of species by natural selection ' .
the islands have been in existence for three- to four million years .
ninety percent of reptiles and fifty percent of birds are unique to the islands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.06.2002 italy cracks down on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish refugees in bari , italy after denmark , italy is the next european country to pass a tough new immigration bill designed to restrict the freedom of non-eu foreigners .
opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .

democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it . a decision in the german parliament in the coming weeks will determine whether the country 's sixty million eligible voters should be able to participate directly in the political process .
on friday , parliament will begin debating whether to amend the constitution to allow for popular referenda .
a draft bill was introduced in the lower house this week by the ruling social democrat-green coalition , in response to a demand by the group ' citizens for a referendum ' .
germany has no provision for popular participation through referendum at a national level .
germans elect their parliamentary representatives , but can not vote on separate questions between elections .
democracy from below the spd / greens bill proposes to replace the top-down system with one which allows citizens to initiate and then vote in referenda on questions excepting those that concern the budget or introduction of the death penalty .
in the first stage of the process , the lower house of parliament is required to address any initiative presented by the citizenry , provided at least 400,000 signatures have been collected .
if the question is not addressed within eight months , the citizens can demand a plebiscite .
the signatures of five percent of eligible voters -lrb- approximately three million people -rrb- must be collected within six months .
once the signatures have been presented , a referendum must take place within six months , and at least twenty percent must turn out to vote .
if the question concerns an amendment to the constitution , at least forty percent have to vote .
lobbyists and loopholes while germans do have the right in principle to hold referenda , no law exists to regulate them .
citizens for a referendum says its proposal to amend the constitution could eliminate a legal loophole .
but although the group believes a majority in parliament will support the bill , it is likely to face opposition from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the bill 's oponents say the introduction of popular referenda would endanger the democratic system and threaten the parliament 's legitimacy .
they also argue that complex questions debated in the german parliament can not be reduced to a simple ' yes ' or ' no ' vote .
changing germany 's constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament , which means the bill needs the support of the cdu / csu to be passed .
ironically , if the question were put to a popular vote , the result would be a clear ' yes ' .
citizens for a referendum spokesperson claudine nierth says an overwhelming majority of the germans want to have a say in their country 's future .
that 's supported by opinion polls which show more than seventy percent of people want the right to vote on important questions as well as participating in elections .

the effects of a huge oil spill in the galápagos islands last year may be much worse than earlier thought .
ecologists say the oil caused 62 percent of rare marine iguanas to starve to death . more than a year after the cargo ship ' jessica ' ran aground on a sandbank in the galápagos islands , spilling almost all of its cargo of diesel and bunker fuel into the sea , scientists say the accident has had a severe impact on the islands ' rare marine iguanas -lrb- amblyrhynchus cristatus -rrb- .
the erratic currents of the galápagos archipelago carried patches of bunker fuel as far as 130km away from where the ship ran aground .
five major islands were affected by the spill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessica ran aground near san cristóbal island on january 16 , 2001 .
the charles darwin foundation for the galápagos islands says that given the quantity of oil spilled , the effects could have been much worse .
good weather and the efforts of the galápagos national park service to keep the bunker fuel off the beaches meant the wildlife had a lucky escape .
iguanas unlucky but eco-physiologist at princeton university in new jersey , martin wikelski , this week published findings of research in the science journal ' nature ' which suggest some galápagos animals were n't so lucky .
wikelski 's research shows that more than sixty percent of marked iguanas on santa fe island , which was subject to contamination , have died .
adult iguanas on the island of santa fe have no natural predators and their normal cause of death is lack of food or old age .
wikelski 's team thinks that spilled oil killed microbes in the iguanas ' guts that enable the animals to digest algae , causing them to starve .
the scientists say their research shows that even low-level pollution can cause serious damage to wildlife . " our findings warn against complacency over apparently low-impact contamination after environmental disasters in other wildlife areas , " wikelski said .
still counting the cost wikelski is seeking damages of us $ 600,000 as part of a wider $ 14m claim being brought by the galápagos national park against the owners and insurers of the tanker .
the park is also seeking damages from petrocomercial , an arm of the ecuadorian state oil company which owned the oil , to cover the cost of cleaning up the spill and monitoring its effects , as well as loss of tourism and fishing revenues .
hearings in the case began in february in the high court at guayaquil , ecuador .
wikelski is claiming that the spill prevented him from conducting research on the iguanas .
the $ 600,000 represents some of the funding he and his team had received from germany 's max planck society , the university of princeton and the us national science foundation .
if he wins , wikelski says the money will be used to set up a fund for young ecuadorian scientists .
the galápagos islands ' unique flora and fauna inspired charles darwin to write ' on the origin of species by natural selection ' .
the islands have been in existence for three- to four million years .
ninety percent of reptiles and fifty percent of birds are unique to the islands .

if the question is not addressed within eight months , the citizens can demand a plebiscite .
the signatures of five percent of eligible voters -lrb- approximately three million people -rrb- must be collected within six months .
once the signatures have been presented , a referendum must take place within six months , and at least twenty percent must turn out to vote .
if the question concerns an amendment to the constitution , at least forty percent have to vote .
lobbyists and loopholes while germans do have the right in principle to hold referenda , no law exists to regulate them .
citizens for a referendum says its proposal to amend the constitution could eliminate a legal loophole .
but although the group believes a majority in parliament will support the bill , it is likely to face opposition from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the bill 's oponents say the introduction of popular referenda would endanger the democratic system and threaten the parliament 's legitimacy .
they also argue that complex questions debated in the german parliament can not be reduced to a simple ' yes ' or ' no ' vote .
changing germany 's constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament , which means the bill needs the support of the cdu / csu to be passed .
ironically , if the question were put to a popular vote , the result would be a clear ' yes ' .

democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it . a decision in the german parliament in the coming weeks will determine whether the country 's sixty million eligible voters should be able to participate directly in the political process .
on friday , parliament will begin debating whether to amend the constitution to allow for popular referenda .
a draft bill was introduced in the lower house this week by the ruling social democrat-green coalition , in response to a demand by the group ' citizens for a referendum ' .
germany has no provision for popular participation through referendum at a national level .
germans elect their parliamentary representatives , but can not vote on separate questions between elections .

opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .

the effects of a huge oil spill in the galápagos islands last year may be much worse than earlier thought .
ecologists say the oil caused 62 percent of rare marine iguanas to starve to death . more than a year after the cargo ship ' jessica ' ran aground on a sandbank in the galápagos islands , spilling almost all of its cargo of diesel and bunker fuel into the sea , scientists say the accident has had a severe impact on the islands ' rare marine iguanas -lrb- amblyrhynchus cristatus -rrb- .
the erratic currents of the galápagos archipelago carried patches of bunker fuel as far as 130km away from where the ship ran aground .
five major islands were affected by the spill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessica ran aground near san cristóbal island on january 16 , 2001 .
the charles darwin foundation for the galápagos islands says that given the quantity of oil spilled , the effects could have been much worse .
good weather and the efforts of the galápagos national park service to keep the bunker fuel off the beaches meant the wildlife had a lucky escape .
iguanas unlucky but eco-physiologist at princeton university in new jersey , martin wikelski , this week published findings of research in the science journal ' nature ' which suggest some galápagos animals were n't so lucky .
wikelski 's research shows that more than sixty percent of marked iguanas on santa fe island , which was subject to contamination , have died .
adult iguanas on the island of santa fe have no natural predators and their normal cause of death is lack of food or old age .
wikelski 's team thinks that spilled oil killed microbes in the iguanas ' guts that enable the animals to digest algae , causing them to starve .
the scientists say their research shows that even low-level pollution can cause serious damage to wildlife . " our findings warn against complacency over apparently low-impact contamination after environmental disasters in other wildlife areas , " wikelski said .
still counting the cost wikelski is seeking damages of us $ 600,000 as part of a wider $ 14m claim being brought by the galápagos national park against the owners and insurers of the tanker .
the park is also seeking damages from petrocomercial , an arm of the ecuadorian state oil company which owned the oil , to cover the cost of cleaning up the spill and monitoring its effects , as well as loss of tourism and fishing revenues .
hearings in the case began in february in the high court at guayaquil , ecuador .
wikelski is claiming that the spill prevented him from conducting research on the iguanas .
the $ 600,000 represents some of the funding he and his team had received from germany 's max planck society , the university of princeton and the us national science foundation .
if he wins , wikelski says the money will be used to set up a fund for young ecuadorian scientists .
the galápagos islands ' unique flora and fauna inspired charles darwin to write ' on the origin of species by natural selection ' .
the islands have been in existence for three- to four million years .
ninety percent of reptiles and fifty percent of birds are unique to the islands .

the politician at the center of a scandal over alleged anti-semitism within the liberal free democratic party apologizes and announces the departure of the israel critic in his state group who triggered the quarrel . one day after his party 's chief gave issued an ultimatum , the free democrats ' leader in the state of north rhine-westphalia apologized on thursday for recent statements that germany 's leading jewish organization had condemned as anti-semitic .
" i have already publicly regretted these statements made in a fit of rage .
if i offended the sensibilities of jewish people in making them , i would like to apologize , " jürgen möllemann said on thursday .
the fdp 's beleaguered chairman and chancellor candidate , guido westerwelle , welcomed the news .
" with this statement today , jürgen möllemann has cleared up the matter and i welcome his remarks , " he said .
" mr. möllemann is my deputy , he will remain my deputy , and i will continue to work with him as a major contributor to realizing our election goals . "
in response , the central council of jews issued a statement saying it was once again open to a dialogue with the free democrats in order to resolve allegations that the party has become a magnet for anti-semites .
the council 's head , paul spiegel , said he would would meet next week with westerwelle , but he insisted that möllemann be excluded .
spiegel 's demand came after möllemann appeared on public television thursday to further qualify his apology .
" michel friedmann did n't earn an apology , " he said , adding that the apology was directed at german jews and not the deputy leader of the central council .
last month möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
meanwhile , a controversial member of the state party whose own anti-israel statements initially sparked the scandal also tendered his written resignation .
jamal karsli said that by departing from the fdp 's group in the north rhine-westphalia state parliament he hoped to avert an even larger rift in the party .
he also apologized for his recent claim that the israeli army used " nazi methods " against palestinians .
karsli made the statement as he left the green party over what he described as its overly pro-israel slant and applied for fdp membership .
many inside and outside the party criticized his participation in the fdp 's state parliamentary group .
möllemann , however , remained a staunch defender until this week , and it was during his effort to keep karsli that he lashed out at friedmann . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fdp leader issues ultimatum to state leader in anti-semitism flap the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp .

the politician at the center of a scandal over alleged anti-semitism within the liberal free democratic party apologizes and announces the departure of the israel critic in his state group who triggered the quarrel . one day after his party 's chief gave issued an ultimatum , the free democrats ' leader in the state of north rhine-westphalia apologized on thursday for recent statements that germany 's leading jewish organization had condemned as anti-semitic .
" i have already publicly regretted these statements made in a fit of rage .
if i offended the sensibilities of jewish people in making them , i would like to apologize , " jürgen möllemann said on thursday .
the fdp 's beleaguered chairman and chancellor candidate , guido westerwelle , welcomed the news .
" with this statement today , jürgen möllemann has cleared up the matter and i welcome his remarks , " he said .
" mr. möllemann is my deputy , he will remain my deputy , and i will continue to work with him as a major contributor to realizing our election goals . "
in response , the central council of jews issued a statement saying it was once again open to a dialogue with the free democrats in order to resolve allegations that the party has become a magnet for anti-semites .
the council 's head , paul spiegel , said he would would meet next week with westerwelle , but he insisted that möllemann be excluded .
spiegel 's demand came after möllemann appeared on public television thursday to further qualify his apology .
" michel friedmann did n't earn an apology , " he said , adding that the apology was directed at german jews and not the deputy leader of the central council .
last month möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
meanwhile , a controversial member of the state party whose own anti-israel statements initially sparked the scandal also tendered his written resignation .
jamal karsli said that by departing from the fdp 's group in the north rhine-westphalia state parliament he hoped to avert an even larger rift in the party .
he also apologized for his recent claim that the israeli army used " nazi methods " against palestinians .
karsli made the statement as he left the green party over what he described as its overly pro-israel slant and applied for fdp membership .
many inside and outside the party criticized his participation in the fdp 's state parliamentary group .

the effects of a huge oil spill in the galápagos islands last year may be much worse than earlier thought .
ecologists say the oil caused 62 percent of rare marine iguanas to starve to death . more than a year after the cargo ship ' jessica ' ran aground on a sandbank in the galápagos islands , spilling almost all of its cargo of diesel and bunker fuel into the sea , scientists say the accident has had a severe impact on the islands ' rare marine iguanas -lrb- amblyrhynchus cristatus -rrb- .
the erratic currents of the galápagos archipelago carried patches of bunker fuel as far as 130km away from where the ship ran aground .
five major islands were affected by the spill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessica ran aground near san cristóbal island on january 16 , 2001 .
the charles darwin foundation for the galápagos islands says that given the quantity of oil spilled , the effects could have been much worse .
good weather and the efforts of the galápagos national park service to keep the bunker fuel off the beaches meant the wildlife had a lucky escape .
iguanas unlucky but eco-physiologist at princeton university in new jersey , martin wikelski , this week published findings of research in the science journal ' nature ' which suggest some galápagos animals were n't so lucky .
wikelski 's research shows that more than sixty percent of marked iguanas on santa fe island , which was subject to contamination , have died .
adult iguanas on the island of santa fe have no natural predators and their normal cause of death is lack of food or old age .
wikelski 's team thinks that spilled oil killed microbes in the iguanas ' guts that enable the animals to digest algae , causing them to starve .
the scientists say their research shows that even low-level pollution can cause serious damage to wildlife . " our findings warn against complacency over apparently low-impact contamination after environmental disasters in other wildlife areas , " wikelski said .
still counting the cost wikelski is seeking damages of us $ 600,000 as part of a wider $ 14m claim being brought by the galápagos national park against the owners and insurers of the tanker .
the park is also seeking damages from petrocomercial , an arm of the ecuadorian state oil company which owned the oil , to cover the cost of cleaning up the spill and monitoring its effects , as well as loss of tourism and fishing revenues .
hearings in the case began in february in the high court at guayaquil , ecuador .
wikelski is claiming that the spill prevented him from conducting research on the iguanas .
the $ 600,000 represents some of the funding he and his team had received from germany 's max planck society , the university of princeton and the us national science foundation .
if he wins , wikelski says the money will be used to set up a fund for young ecuadorian scientists .

the politician at the center of a scandal over alleged anti-semitism within the liberal free democratic party apologizes and announces the departure of the israel critic in his state group who triggered the quarrel . one day after his party 's chief gave issued an ultimatum , the free democrats ' leader in the state of north rhine-westphalia apologized on thursday for recent statements that germany 's leading jewish organization had condemned as anti-semitic .
" i have already publicly regretted these statements made in a fit of rage .
if i offended the sensibilities of jewish people in making them , i would like to apologize , " jürgen möllemann said on thursday .
the fdp 's beleaguered chairman and chancellor candidate , guido westerwelle , welcomed the news .
" with this statement today , jürgen möllemann has cleared up the matter and i welcome his remarks , " he said .
" mr. möllemann is my deputy , he will remain my deputy , and i will continue to work with him as a major contributor to realizing our election goals . "
in response , the central council of jews issued a statement saying it was once again open to a dialogue with the free democrats in order to resolve allegations that the party has become a magnet for anti-semites .
the council 's head , paul spiegel , said he would would meet next week with westerwelle , but he insisted that möllemann be excluded .
spiegel 's demand came after möllemann appeared on public television thursday to further qualify his apology .
" michel friedmann did n't earn an apology , " he said , adding that the apology was directed at german jews and not the deputy leader of the central council .

jamal karsli said that by departing from the fdp 's group in the north rhine-westphalia state parliament he hoped to avert an even larger rift in the party .
he also apologized for his recent claim that the israeli army used " nazi methods " against palestinians .
karsli made the statement as he left the green party over what he described as its overly pro-israel slant and applied for fdp membership .
many inside and outside the party criticized his participation in the fdp 's state parliamentary group .
möllemann , however , remained a staunch defender until this week , and it was during his effort to keep karsli that he lashed out at friedmann . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fdp leader issues ultimatum to state leader in anti-semitism flap the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp .

democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it . a decision in the german parliament in the coming weeks will determine whether the country 's sixty million eligible voters should be able to participate directly in the political process .
on friday , parliament will begin debating whether to amend the constitution to allow for popular referenda .
a draft bill was introduced in the lower house this week by the ruling social democrat-green coalition , in response to a demand by the group ' citizens for a referendum ' .
germany has no provision for popular participation through referendum at a national level .
germans elect their parliamentary representatives , but can not vote on separate questions between elections .
democracy from below the spd / greens bill proposes to replace the top-down system with one which allows citizens to initiate and then vote in referenda on questions excepting those that concern the budget or introduction of the death penalty .
in the first stage of the process , the lower house of parliament is required to address any initiative presented by the citizenry , provided at least 400,000 signatures have been collected .
if the question is not addressed within eight months , the citizens can demand a plebiscite .
the signatures of five percent of eligible voters -lrb- approximately three million people -rrb- must be collected within six months .
once the signatures have been presented , a referendum must take place within six months , and at least twenty percent must turn out to vote .
if the question concerns an amendment to the constitution , at least forty percent have to vote .
lobbyists and loopholes while germans do have the right in principle to hold referenda , no law exists to regulate them .
citizens for a referendum says its proposal to amend the constitution could eliminate a legal loophole .
but although the group believes a majority in parliament will support the bill , it is likely to face opposition from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the bill 's oponents say the introduction of popular referenda would endanger the democratic system and threaten the parliament 's legitimacy .
they also argue that complex questions debated in the german parliament can not be reduced to a simple ' yes ' or ' no ' vote .
changing germany 's constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament , which means the bill needs the support of the cdu / csu to be passed .
ironically , if the question were put to a popular vote , the result would be a clear ' yes ' .
citizens for a referendum spokesperson claudine nierth says an overwhelming majority of the germans want to have a say in their country 's future .

the effects of a huge oil spill in the galápagos islands last year may be much worse than earlier thought .
ecologists say the oil caused 62 percent of rare marine iguanas to starve to death . more than a year after the cargo ship ' jessica ' ran aground on a sandbank in the galápagos islands , spilling almost all of its cargo of diesel and bunker fuel into the sea , scientists say the accident has had a severe impact on the islands ' rare marine iguanas -lrb- amblyrhynchus cristatus -rrb- .
the erratic currents of the galápagos archipelago carried patches of bunker fuel as far as 130km away from where the ship ran aground .
five major islands were affected by the spill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessica ran aground near san cristóbal island on january 16 , 2001 .
the charles darwin foundation for the galápagos islands says that given the quantity of oil spilled , the effects could have been much worse .
good weather and the efforts of the galápagos national park service to keep the bunker fuel off the beaches meant the wildlife had a lucky escape .
iguanas unlucky but eco-physiologist at princeton university in new jersey , martin wikelski , this week published findings of research in the science journal ' nature ' which suggest some galápagos animals were n't so lucky .
wikelski 's research shows that more than sixty percent of marked iguanas on santa fe island , which was subject to contamination , have died .
adult iguanas on the island of santa fe have no natural predators and their normal cause of death is lack of food or old age .
wikelski 's team thinks that spilled oil killed microbes in the iguanas ' guts that enable the animals to digest algae , causing them to starve .
the scientists say their research shows that even low-level pollution can cause serious damage to wildlife . " our findings warn against complacency over apparently low-impact contamination after environmental disasters in other wildlife areas , " wikelski said .
still counting the cost wikelski is seeking damages of us $ 600,000 as part of a wider $ 14m claim being brought by the galápagos national park against the owners and insurers of the tanker .
the park is also seeking damages from petrocomercial , an arm of the ecuadorian state oil company which owned the oil , to cover the cost of cleaning up the spill and monitoring its effects , as well as loss of tourism and fishing revenues .
hearings in the case began in february in the high court at guayaquil , ecuador .
wikelski is claiming that the spill prevented him from conducting research on the iguanas .
the $ 600,000 represents some of the funding he and his team had received from germany 's max planck society , the university of princeton and the us national science foundation .
if he wins , wikelski says the money will be used to set up a fund for young ecuadorian scientists .
the galápagos islands ' unique flora and fauna inspired charles darwin to write ' on the origin of species by natural selection ' .
the islands have been in existence for three- to four million years .
ninety percent of reptiles and fifty percent of birds are unique to the islands .

democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it . a decision in the german parliament in the coming weeks will determine whether the country 's sixty million eligible voters should be able to participate directly in the political process .
on friday , parliament will begin debating whether to amend the constitution to allow for popular referenda .
a draft bill was introduced in the lower house this week by the ruling social democrat-green coalition , in response to a demand by the group ' citizens for a referendum ' .
germany has no provision for popular participation through referendum at a national level .
germans elect their parliamentary representatives , but can not vote on separate questions between elections .
democracy from below the spd / greens bill proposes to replace the top-down system with one which allows citizens to initiate and then vote in referenda on questions excepting those that concern the budget or introduction of the death penalty .
in the first stage of the process , the lower house of parliament is required to address any initiative presented by the citizenry , provided at least 400,000 signatures have been collected .
if the question is not addressed within eight months , the citizens can demand a plebiscite .
the signatures of five percent of eligible voters -lrb- approximately three million people -rrb- must be collected within six months .
once the signatures have been presented , a referendum must take place within six months , and at least twenty percent must turn out to vote .
if the question concerns an amendment to the constitution , at least forty percent have to vote .
lobbyists and loopholes while germans do have the right in principle to hold referenda , no law exists to regulate them .
citizens for a referendum says its proposal to amend the constitution could eliminate a legal loophole .
but although the group believes a majority in parliament will support the bill , it is likely to face opposition from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the bill 's oponents say the introduction of popular referenda would endanger the democratic system and threaten the parliament 's legitimacy .
they also argue that complex questions debated in the german parliament can not be reduced to a simple ' yes ' or ' no ' vote .
changing germany 's constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament , which means the bill needs the support of the cdu / csu to be passed .
ironically , if the question were put to a popular vote , the result would be a clear ' yes ' .
citizens for a referendum spokesperson claudine nierth says an overwhelming majority of the germans want to have a say in their country 's future .
that 's supported by opinion polls which show more than seventy percent of people want the right to vote on important questions as well as participating in elections .
citizens for a referendum , which is an initiative of ' more democracy ' , has widespread support across germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german parliament - material on referendum bill printed materials -lrb- in german -rrb- ' more democracy ' official homepage of ' more democracy ' -lrb- in german -rrb- 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .

opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .

opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .
while the current immigration bill still needs the final approval of the upper house , or senate , before it can become law , berlusconi and bossi are already claiming a victory over what they refer to as " the hordes invading italy ’ s shores " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country -lrb- june 3 , 2002 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

iguanas unlucky but eco-physiologist at princeton university in new jersey , martin wikelski , this week published findings of research in the science journal ' nature ' which suggest some galápagos animals were n't so lucky .
wikelski 's research shows that more than sixty percent of marked iguanas on santa fe island , which was subject to contamination , have died .
adult iguanas on the island of santa fe have no natural predators and their normal cause of death is lack of food or old age .
wikelski 's team thinks that spilled oil killed microbes in the iguanas ' guts that enable the animals to digest algae , causing them to starve .
the scientists say their research shows that even low-level pollution can cause serious damage to wildlife . " our findings warn against complacency over apparently low-impact contamination after environmental disasters in other wildlife areas , " wikelski said .

hearings in the case began in february in the high court at guayaquil , ecuador .
wikelski is claiming that the spill prevented him from conducting research on the iguanas .
the $ 600,000 represents some of the funding he and his team had received from germany 's max planck society , the university of princeton and the us national science foundation .

the effects of a huge oil spill in the galápagos islands last year may be much worse than earlier thought .
ecologists say the oil caused 62 percent of rare marine iguanas to starve to death . more than a year after the cargo ship ' jessica ' ran aground on a sandbank in the galápagos islands , spilling almost all of its cargo of diesel and bunker fuel into the sea , scientists say the accident has had a severe impact on the islands ' rare marine iguanas -lrb- amblyrhynchus cristatus -rrb- .
the erratic currents of the galápagos archipelago carried patches of bunker fuel as far as 130km away from where the ship ran aground .
five major islands were affected by the spill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessica ran aground near san cristóbal island on january 16 , 2001 .
the charles darwin foundation for the galápagos islands says that given the quantity of oil spilled , the effects could have been much worse .
good weather and the efforts of the galápagos national park service to keep the bunker fuel off the beaches meant the wildlife had a lucky escape .
iguanas unlucky but eco-physiologist at princeton university in new jersey , martin wikelski , this week published findings of research in the science journal ' nature ' which suggest some galápagos animals were n't so lucky .
wikelski 's research shows that more than sixty percent of marked iguanas on santa fe island , which was subject to contamination , have died .
adult iguanas on the island of santa fe have no natural predators and their normal cause of death is lack of food or old age .
wikelski 's team thinks that spilled oil killed microbes in the iguanas ' guts that enable the animals to digest algae , causing them to starve .
the scientists say their research shows that even low-level pollution can cause serious damage to wildlife . " our findings warn against complacency over apparently low-impact contamination after environmental disasters in other wildlife areas , " wikelski said .
still counting the cost wikelski is seeking damages of us $ 600,000 as part of a wider $ 14m claim being brought by the galápagos national park against the owners and insurers of the tanker .
the park is also seeking damages from petrocomercial , an arm of the ecuadorian state oil company which owned the oil , to cover the cost of cleaning up the spill and monitoring its effects , as well as loss of tourism and fishing revenues .
hearings in the case began in february in the high court at guayaquil , ecuador .
wikelski is claiming that the spill prevented him from conducting research on the iguanas .
the $ 600,000 represents some of the funding he and his team had received from germany 's max planck society , the university of princeton and the us national science foundation .
if he wins , wikelski says the money will be used to set up a fund for young ecuadorian scientists .
the galápagos islands ' unique flora and fauna inspired charles darwin to write ' on the origin of species by natural selection ' .
the islands have been in existence for three- to four million years .
ninety percent of reptiles and fifty percent of birds are unique to the islands .

the politician at the center of a scandal over alleged anti-semitism within the liberal free democratic party apologizes and announces the departure of the israel critic in his state group who triggered the quarrel . one day after his party 's chief gave issued an ultimatum , the free democrats ' leader in the state of north rhine-westphalia apologized on thursday for recent statements that germany 's leading jewish organization had condemned as anti-semitic .
" i have already publicly regretted these statements made in a fit of rage .
if i offended the sensibilities of jewish people in making them , i would like to apologize , " jürgen möllemann said on thursday .

" with this statement today , jürgen möllemann has cleared up the matter and i welcome his remarks , " he said .
" mr. möllemann is my deputy , he will remain my deputy , and i will continue to work with him as a major contributor to realizing our election goals . "
in response , the central council of jews issued a statement saying it was once again open to a dialogue with the free democrats in order to resolve allegations that the party has become a magnet for anti-semites .
the council 's head , paul spiegel , said he would would meet next week with westerwelle , but he insisted that möllemann be excluded .

he also apologized for his recent claim that the israeli army used " nazi methods " against palestinians .
karsli made the statement as he left the green party over what he described as its overly pro-israel slant and applied for fdp membership .

the effects of a huge oil spill in the galápagos islands last year may be much worse than earlier thought .
ecologists say the oil caused 62 percent of rare marine iguanas to starve to death . more than a year after the cargo ship ' jessica ' ran aground on a sandbank in the galápagos islands , spilling almost all of its cargo of diesel and bunker fuel into the sea , scientists say the accident has had a severe impact on the islands ' rare marine iguanas -lrb- amblyrhynchus cristatus -rrb- .
the erratic currents of the galápagos archipelago carried patches of bunker fuel as far as 130km away from where the ship ran aground .
five major islands were affected by the spill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jessica ran aground near san cristóbal island on january 16 , 2001 .
the charles darwin foundation for the galápagos islands says that given the quantity of oil spilled , the effects could have been much worse .
good weather and the efforts of the galápagos national park service to keep the bunker fuel off the beaches meant the wildlife had a lucky escape .
iguanas unlucky but eco-physiologist at princeton university in new jersey , martin wikelski , this week published findings of research in the science journal ' nature ' which suggest some galápagos animals were n't so lucky .
wikelski 's research shows that more than sixty percent of marked iguanas on santa fe island , which was subject to contamination , have died .
adult iguanas on the island of santa fe have no natural predators and their normal cause of death is lack of food or old age .
wikelski 's team thinks that spilled oil killed microbes in the iguanas ' guts that enable the animals to digest algae , causing them to starve .
the scientists say their research shows that even low-level pollution can cause serious damage to wildlife . " our findings warn against complacency over apparently low-impact contamination after environmental disasters in other wildlife areas , " wikelski said .
still counting the cost wikelski is seeking damages of us $ 600,000 as part of a wider $ 14m claim being brought by the galápagos national park against the owners and insurers of the tanker .
the park is also seeking damages from petrocomercial , an arm of the ecuadorian state oil company which owned the oil , to cover the cost of cleaning up the spill and monitoring its effects , as well as loss of tourism and fishing revenues .
hearings in the case began in february in the high court at guayaquil , ecuador .
wikelski is claiming that the spill prevented him from conducting research on the iguanas .
the $ 600,000 represents some of the funding he and his team had received from germany 's max planck society , the university of princeton and the us national science foundation .
if he wins , wikelski says the money will be used to set up a fund for young ecuadorian scientists .

democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it . a decision in the german parliament in the coming weeks will determine whether the country 's sixty million eligible voters should be able to participate directly in the political process .
on friday , parliament will begin debating whether to amend the constitution to allow for popular referenda .
a draft bill was introduced in the lower house this week by the ruling social democrat-green coalition , in response to a demand by the group ' citizens for a referendum ' .
germany has no provision for popular participation through referendum at a national level .
germans elect their parliamentary representatives , but can not vote on separate questions between elections .
democracy from below the spd / greens bill proposes to replace the top-down system with one which allows citizens to initiate and then vote in referenda on questions excepting those that concern the budget or introduction of the death penalty .
in the first stage of the process , the lower house of parliament is required to address any initiative presented by the citizenry , provided at least 400,000 signatures have been collected .
if the question is not addressed within eight months , the citizens can demand a plebiscite .
the signatures of five percent of eligible voters -lrb- approximately three million people -rrb- must be collected within six months .
once the signatures have been presented , a referendum must take place within six months , and at least twenty percent must turn out to vote .
if the question concerns an amendment to the constitution , at least forty percent have to vote .
lobbyists and loopholes while germans do have the right in principle to hold referenda , no law exists to regulate them .
citizens for a referendum says its proposal to amend the constitution could eliminate a legal loophole .
but although the group believes a majority in parliament will support the bill , it is likely to face opposition from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the bill 's oponents say the introduction of popular referenda would endanger the democratic system and threaten the parliament 's legitimacy .
they also argue that complex questions debated in the german parliament can not be reduced to a simple ' yes ' or ' no ' vote .
changing germany 's constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament , which means the bill needs the support of the cdu / csu to be passed .
ironically , if the question were put to a popular vote , the result would be a clear ' yes ' .
citizens for a referendum spokesperson claudine nierth says an overwhelming majority of the germans want to have a say in their country 's future .
that 's supported by opinion polls which show more than seventy percent of people want the right to vote on important questions as well as participating in elections .

democracy in germany is up for debate , but not if the politicians can help it . a decision in the german parliament in the coming weeks will determine whether the country 's sixty million eligible voters should be able to participate directly in the political process .
on friday , parliament will begin debating whether to amend the constitution to allow for popular referenda .
a draft bill was introduced in the lower house this week by the ruling social democrat-green coalition , in response to a demand by the group ' citizens for a referendum ' .
germany has no provision for popular participation through referendum at a national level .
germans elect their parliamentary representatives , but can not vote on separate questions between elections .
democracy from below the spd / greens bill proposes to replace the top-down system with one which allows citizens to initiate and then vote in referenda on questions excepting those that concern the budget or introduction of the death penalty .
in the first stage of the process , the lower house of parliament is required to address any initiative presented by the citizenry , provided at least 400,000 signatures have been collected .
if the question is not addressed within eight months , the citizens can demand a plebiscite .
the signatures of five percent of eligible voters -lrb- approximately three million people -rrb- must be collected within six months .
once the signatures have been presented , a referendum must take place within six months , and at least twenty percent must turn out to vote .
if the question concerns an amendment to the constitution , at least forty percent have to vote .
lobbyists and loopholes while germans do have the right in principle to hold referenda , no law exists to regulate them .
citizens for a referendum says its proposal to amend the constitution could eliminate a legal loophole .
but although the group believes a majority in parliament will support the bill , it is likely to face opposition from the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , its bavarian sister-party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , and the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the bill 's oponents say the introduction of popular referenda would endanger the democratic system and threaten the parliament 's legitimacy .
they also argue that complex questions debated in the german parliament can not be reduced to a simple ' yes ' or ' no ' vote .
changing germany 's constitution requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament , which means the bill needs the support of the cdu / csu to be passed .
ironically , if the question were put to a popular vote , the result would be a clear ' yes ' .
citizens for a referendum spokesperson claudine nierth says an overwhelming majority of the germans want to have a say in their country 's future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.06.2002 italy cracks down on immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurdish refugees in bari , italy after denmark , italy is the next european country to pass a tough new immigration bill designed to restrict the freedom of non-eu foreigners .
opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .
while the current immigration bill still needs the final approval of the upper house , or senate , before it can become law , berlusconi and bossi are already claiming a victory over what they refer to as " the hordes invading italy ’ s shores " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country -lrb- june 3 , 2002 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

opponents say the harsh measures , including forced fingerprinting , are racist . continuing along the european course set by britain and denmark last week , italy ’ s parliament has just passed its own series of harsh new anti-immigration measures .
the proposals , which include such draconian measures as mandatory fingerprinting for all non-european union citizens , are designed to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants entering the country .
opposition groups , however , refer to the new bill as " unjust and racist " .
in a vote of 279 to 203 , the anti-immigration bill was approved by the largely conservative lower house of parliament on tuesday .
prior to the vote , a heated debate erupted between the ruling coalition of prime minister silvio berlusconi and the left-wing opposition , which lambasted the proposed law as racist and unjust .
several opposition politicians criticized the government , saying it was creating a climate of fear and hatred .
" there aren ’ t sufficient adjectives to describe this law : it ’ s unjust , fascist , disgusting , enslaving and racist , " graziella mascia , a member of the refounded communist party , told the lower house before voting against the bill .
praising the vote ’ s outcome , umberto bossi , head of the right-wing northern league party and a member of berlusconi ’ s cabinet , told reporters " in our electoral platform we promised a law which would sort out immigration , and we ’ ve won . "
immigrants or criminals ?
in addition to increasing patrols of italy ’ s coastline and its borders with eastern europe , the new immigration bill attempts to cut down on the number of illegal immigrants already living and working in italy .
the government , which has linked a rise in immigration with an increase in crime , will require all non-eu citizens and anyone from the united states or other non-european countries to be fingerprinted before applying for a " permesso di soggiorno " or permit to stay in the country .
non-eu foreigners will only be able to reside in italy if they have arranged work before coming to the country .
once they arrive in italy , the foreigners will be required to show proof of a written employment contract .
at that time the immigrants will receive a residency permit only for the duration of their work contract , for up to a maximum of two years .
when their contract expires , the foreigners will be forced to leave italy .
immigrant families may only bring their children with them to italy if they are under the age of 18 .
anyone older is considered an adult and must apply separately for a residency permit as well as show proof of employment .
any immigrant who returns to italy after being expelled from the country will be treated as if he or she has committed a crime .
and anyone who helps illegal immigrants enter italy will be considered guilty of abetting a crime .
smugglers face prison sentences of four to 12 years and a fine of 15,000 euro for each immigrant they bring into the country .
umberto bossi has said that the new immigration control measures and fingerprinting are merely a means of keeping track of illegal immigrants .
but human rights organizations and opposition politicians say the government ’ s bill treats immigrants as if they were criminals .
" it ’ s undignified of a civil country to equate illegal immigrants with criminals and to say that those who help illegal immigrants are committing a grave crime , " said oliviero diliberto , leader of the italian communist party .
luciano violante , head of the largest opposition party in the lower house , accused the government of " creating a climate of fear and hatred " , which would only worsen the situation for the country ’ s immigrants and asylum seekers .
the italian immigration issue despite the vocal criticism , the new immigration bill has been fully endorsed by the italian government as a solution for what it see as a growing wave of illegal immigration .
since taking office last year , berlusconi and bossi have made the control of immigration a central goal in their conservative administration .
they have focused efforts on policing borders and waterways and tracking down illegal immigrants hiding out in the country .
the number of expulsions of asylum seekers alone has increased by 30 percent in just the first year of berlusconi ’ s government .
and such strict measures seem to meet with widespread support among the italian population .
although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .
while the current immigration bill still needs the final approval of the upper house , or senate , before it can become law , berlusconi and bossi are already claiming a victory over what they refer to as " the hordes invading italy ’ s shores " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country -lrb- june 3 , 2002 -rrb- 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" i have already publicly regretted these statements made in a fit of rage .
if i offended the sensibilities of jewish people in making them , i would like to apologize , " jürgen möllemann said on thursday .
the fdp 's beleaguered chairman and chancellor candidate , guido westerwelle , welcomed the news .
" with this statement today , jürgen möllemann has cleared up the matter and i welcome his remarks , " he said .
" mr. möllemann is my deputy , he will remain my deputy , and i will continue to work with him as a major contributor to realizing our election goals . "

the council 's head , paul spiegel , said he would would meet next week with westerwelle , but he insisted that möllemann be excluded .

he also apologized for his recent claim that the israeli army used " nazi methods " against palestinians .
karsli made the statement as he left the green party over what he described as its overly pro-israel slant and applied for fdp membership .
many inside and outside the party criticized his participation in the fdp 's state parliamentary group .

although italy has a relatively small immigrant community of only about 2.2 percent of the entire population , recent opinion polls show that a majority of italians fear excessive immigration and link illegal immigrants with an increase in crime .
public opinion began to turn in favor of a get-tough policy back in march when the government was forced to declare a state of emergency to deal with the sudden influx of some 1,000 kurdish refugees arriving on the coast of sicily in dilapidated ships .
while the current immigration bill still needs the final approval of the upper house , or senate , before it can become law , berlusconi and bossi are already claiming a victory over what they refer to as " the hordes invading italy ’ s shores " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de denmark turns chilly on immigration traditionally one of the most accommodating places when it comes to refugees , denmark has pulled the welcome mat out from underneath the feet of those wishing to enter and live in the country -lrb- june 3 , 2002 -rrb- 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

this is the ninth in a series of dispatches from around the country .
monday 3 june the palace gates are opened at 3.30 and instantly the crowds come flooding in .
they are a very different bunch to saturday 's - younger , much less well-dressed -lrb- i see only one panama hat , but scores of people have come wrapped in union jacks of one sort of another -rrb- and much less middle-class .
sir michael parker , the pageant master responsible for tuesday afternoon 's processions in the mall , is here and says he thinks there is less of a buzz , less atmosphere than before the first concert .
my producer and i are inclined to agree with him - until we meet a photographer for one of the daily papers who was n't here on saturday , and is absolutely bowled over .
" is n't it fantastic ! " he says .
" what an atmosphere , what a buzz . "
overwhelmed and excited it becomes clear talking to them that monday 's audience are just as overwhelmed and excited at finding themselves here in the queen 's back garden as those who came to the first concert .
plenty have clearly never been to a pop concert before , like one charming couple in their late 60s from county antrim .
their son applied for tickets on behalf of every member of the family - and their names came out of the hat .
would he not have preferred to come himself ?
perhaps , but it was clear he had no chance : mum and dad were determined to be here themselves .
the vips arrive - a posse of politicians , including tony blair and cherie , gordon brown and his wife , jack straw -lrb- all in grey suits -rrb- ; yoko ono ; sir richard branson ; media mogul rupert murdoch and his young wife wendy .
then the royals file in but not the queen , who will arrive at the palace only for the last hour or so of the concert .
prince charles is there with william and harry , the duke of york with his daughters beatrice and eugenie , princess anne , prince and princess michael of kent , and zara phillips , blonde and bubbly in dark glasses .
quite what they all make of it is hard to tell .
ozzy osbourne : well behaved artist the audience love it , standing spellbound as brian may on the roof of the palace strikes up the opening chords of god save the queen ; swaying deliriously to queen 's we are the champions , with pop idol will young in the freddie mercury role ; cheering a perfectly behaved ozzy osbourne to the echo .

but for the most part the royals themselves remain inscrutable - though the prince of wales does laugh heartily at lenny henry 's imitation of him .
prince william at one point puts his hands in his ears to keep out the deafening noise .
the youngsters probably wonder what all the fuss is about - not only the performers but most of the songs date from the 1960s and 1970s , well before they were born .

absurd .

the royal family has never seemed entirely comfortable with pop culture - and actually they do n't seem entirely comfortable tonight .
but no-one watching tonight 's concert - whether the 12,000 inside the palace gardens , the reported one million in the streets and parks outside , or the millions more watching on television - will hold that against them .

union boss john monks has joined the ranks of those urging members of the bank 's monetary policy committee to leave the key interest rate on hold at 4 % after their latest meeting ends later on thursday .
mr monks , general secretary of the tuc , urged the mpc to resist " siren calls " for a rise in rates to counter buoyancy in the uk 's housing and retail sectors .
he said a rise threatened to renew a spate of job losses among uk manufacturers , which a survey on wednesday showed suffered a fall in optimism in may .
also on wednesday , the engineering employers ' federation warned that members forecast a drop in orders and output in the second quarter of the year .
inflation fears the warnings are thought likely stem enthusiasm among mpc members for a rate rise to head-off inflation fears stoked by high street and housing booms .
house prices grew last month at their fastest ever rate , mortgage lender halifax said on tuesday , while official figures showed that retail sales surged by 1.7 % in april .
the bank itself believes inflation will rise above the 2.5 % target rate in two years ' time .
and the weakening of the pound against the euro , amid a switch from the dollar and growing speculation that the uk will adopt europe 's single currency , has been seen as increasing the inflation threat .
weaker sterling leaves importers paying more for foreign goods , raising the threat of higher prices .
rises to come ?
but analysts believe that , with the economy failing to grow over the first three months of the year , the mpc will no raise rates - for now .
" it would be a brave committee that takes the plunge and raises rates at the moment , " said philip shaw , chief economist at investec .
most analysts believe that rates , currently at their lowest for about 40 years , will rise in coming months , reaching even 5 % by the end of the year according to some forecasts .

the move comes as a businessman plans to open a dutch-style cannabis cafe in rhyl .
force chief constable richard brunstrom earlier called for a fresh debate on the drugs laws , but has also vowed to close down the proposed cafe .
despite home office proposals to reclassify cannabis as a class c - rather than class b - drug in the uk , dutch laws are even more liberal .
cannabis can be bought in many coffee shops in amsterdam , where possession of the drug for personal use has been tolerated for years .
concentrate efforts speaking on the fact-finding mission in amsterdam north wales police sergeant , dewi roberts , said : " it is very complicated what they are doing here .
" it is not legal as such but it is tolerated by police and if any of the conditions of the licence are broken they are punished quite heavily . "
it is estimated the dutch capital is home to more than 250 coffee shops , with some also to be found in smaller towns and cities .
senior police officers in amsterdam believe the coffee shop system works , allowing them to concentrate their efforts on tackling hard drugs .
however , the new centre-right dutch government has expressed unease about the country 's reputation as a haven for drug users .
conversely , police in the uk have been relaxing their attitude to those in possession of small amounts of cannabis .
a pilot scheme has been carried out in lambeth , south london , where people found in possession of small amounts of cannabis were cautioned rather than arrested .
mr brunstrom has gone further , suggesting the legalisation of drugs in recognition of the impossibility of enforcing their prohibition .
' serious offence ' however , he has insisted he remains obliged to enforce the law as it stands .
mr brunstrom said : " using premises to supply drugs is a serious offence and we will have to deal with that . "
while the uk authorities contemplate a more lenient approach to drug use , flagrant breaches of the existing laws are not being tolerated .
in may , a row broke out after a businessman set up a website bearing the name of north wales police to advertise his plans for a cannabis cafe in rhyl .
jeff ditchfield , 42 , from henllan in denbighshire , said he bought the domain name - for £ 12.99 to try to open a " sensible debate with police " .
senior officers warned him not to use the site for illegal means and said they would act if the law was broken .
police have already raided two amsterdam-style cannabis cafes which opened in stockport , greater manchester , and bournemouth , dorset .
but despite a number of arrests , both premises remain open .

a host of celebrities were out in force at london 's leicester square for the london showing of the action adventure movie .
lead actors tobey maguire , 26 , and kirsten dunst managed to keep smiling as they greeted wellwishers , thanking them for staying out in the bad weather .
dunst , 20 , who stars as spider-man 's love interest mary-jane watson , was upbeat as she made her way into the gala screening .
" my feet are soaking wet and i 've ruined my leather shoes but i 've been to london before so i 'm used to the rain , " she said .
test of time maguire , who plays spider-man and nerdy alter ego peter parker , received one of the biggest cheers of the evening as he arrived .
" i think it 's a great movie and a lot of people will be excited to see it .
spider-man is a superhero we can all relate to and he has stood the test of time for the past 40 years .
" it was a lot of fun to make and i did some of my own stunts which was fantastic for me . "
the comic-book adaptation opens in the uk on 14 june but it has already broken box office records in the us , becoming the first movie to take more than $ 100m -lrb- £ 67m -rrb- in its opening weekend .
it was set to be released earlier but scenes involving the twin towers had to be removed following the 11 september tragedy .
many of the stars who turned out for the event chose not to sign autographs for fans , instead opting to get into the dry as quickly as possible .
a few celebrities did take the time to greet fans including boy band 3sl , liberty x , mis-teeq 's alesha , pregnant atomic kitten singer natasha hamilton and frank skinner .
webbed clothing there was a big cheer too for pop idol finalist darius danesh who did a quick autograph signing session , unlike the show 's runner-up gareth gates who was whisked inside .
other guests included vic reeves , will self , les dennis , travis and melinda messenger .
getting themselves notices were liberty x 's michelle heaton , model jodie kidd and tv presenter tania strecker , who went for a spider 's web theme with their outfits .
maguire 's previous movies include pleasantville , the cider house rules and the critically acclaimed the ice storm .
dunst has been acting since she was a young girl , appearing with tom cruise in interview with a vampire at the age of 11 .
her numerous film credits include wag the dog , bring it on and get over it .
both the spider-man stars are signed up to appear in the sequel , which will once again be directed by sam raimi .

the creation of the mpc has been hailed as the most important decision gordon brown ever made , and has now been endorsed by all oppositon parties as well .
key dates 2 may 1997 : gordon brown announces creation of mpc 6 may 1997 : brown letter gives mpc mandate 23 may 1997 : schedule of mpc meetings announced 2 june 1997 : first independent mpc members appointed 6 june 1997 : first mpc meeting since the move , inflation in the uk has remained stable around its target rate of 2.5 % - boosting the crediblity of the mpc .
but two broader questions remain : how will the new system help or hinder the uk economy , if it faces a serious recession ; and whether such pressures could undermine the independence of the new body .
credibility much has been claimed of the effectiveness of the mpc - especially compared with its counterparts , the european central bank , which sets interest rates across the 12 european countries that have adopted the euro , and the federal reserve , the us central bank .
unlike the federal reserve , the bank of england has a fixed target for inflation , which , it is argues , makes it clearer when it will take action , taking away uncertainty .
but unlike the european central bank , its inflation target is " symmetrical " , and the bank must pay as much attention to inflation being below as well as above target .
that , it is claimed , means that the bank of england will ensure that growth as well as inflation is given priority .
finally , it is said , the mpc explains its policy decisions better than other central banks , publishing the minutes of its meetings just two weeks after they take place , and setting out its thinking in detail four times a year .
market reaction in the end , however , the structures only matter if they enhance the credibility of the mpc .
if markets and individuals believe that the bank will intervene decisively to restrain inflation , they will modify their behaviour - and make the bank 's task much easier .
this has clearly happened in the past five years .
in particular , wage demands have been more moderate than in the past , and companies have not sought to increase prices in response to higher wages .
as a result , the bank has been able to keep interest rates lower than previously thought despite the low unemployment rate .
taking the credit but in some ways , the new system of setting interest rates has not yet been tested .
inflation has been relatively benign across the whole of the developed world .
and in the uk , the high value of the pound on foreign currency markets has acted as a further check on inflation , as companies tempted to raise prices have been facing cheaper foreign imports .
and the bank 's forecasting model has not worked too well , consistently predicting higher inflation than actually happened , according to retiring mpc member sushil wadwhani .
a sudden change in exchange rates , or a continued surge in house prices , could make the bank 's rate-setting dilemma sharper .
no economist is yet clear on how long it takes for interest rates to affect the real economy - and whether the mpc 's two year forward look at inflation is realistic .
in the past , other sorts of targets - including money supply and the exchange rate - have been tried and failed as a means of controlling inflation .
dual economy despite the new system , as the bank of england has admitted , the uk economy is suffering from serious imbalances .
the service sector and private consumption are booming , as evidenced by the house price boom , while exports and the manufacturing sector are stagnating .
" the challenge for monetary and fiscal authorities is to restore domestic demand growth to sustainable levels , " said deputy governor mervyn king in a recent speech .
he argues that the " rebalancing " of the uk economy could lead to " considerable movement in the exchange rate , oil prices , and even wages " as resources shift from private consumption into exports and public spending .
this could be quite disruptive , although it is " possible - even likely " that the path to lower growth rates of consumption could be smooth .
political limits the mpc 's difficult taks could lead to questions in the future about whether it is sufficiently independent from the government .
former member sushil wadwhani argues that if unemployment starts to rise , questions will be raised about the performance of the committee .
doubts have already been expressed about the political make-up of the committee , with the chancellor appointing four of the nine members - for relatively short terms of 3 years each .
in the united states , in contrast , the members of the federal reserve board serve for 14 years .
and it is the chancellor , not the committee , that sets the target - though why he has adopted 2.5 % , rather than , say the ecb 's 2 % target , has never been spelled out .
if the mpc 's performance were to falter , there would be more pressure to review these elements , and perhaps to revise the inflation target itself .
and the question of more formal coordination with fiscal policy - depriving the chancellor of his freedom to plan for the long-term - might also come to the fore .

the independent television commission -lrb- itc -rrb- drew 136 complaints from viewers who found it " offensive , shocking and in bad taste " .
it starts with a woman giving birth to a baby boy who then shoots out of a window in a surreal sequence . "
the final scene of a body smashing into its grave was unnecessary and had caused considerable distress " itc viewers then saw the boy ageing rapidly as he flies through the air screaming , before violently crashing into his own grave .
the advert ends with the payoff : " life is short .
play more . "
among the angry viewers were a pregnant woman and a new mother who objected to the childbirth scene .
another woman who had lost a baby during childbirth said it was an upsetting reminder of her own experience .
the itc was also told by 20 recently bereaved viewers that they found the advert particularly offensive .
' positive statement ' others who had suffered a major illness considered it to be insensitive .
microsoft claimed the advert conveyed a " positive statement about life " but the itc upheld the complaints and ordered it not to be re-shown .
the watchdog said that the man 's screams " suggested a traumatic experience which , together with the reminder that life is short , made the final scene more shocking " .
the itc also reiterated its advice to the broadcast advertising clearance centre , which approves tv adverts before they are broadcast , to be more sensitive about themes involving death .
" advertisements can not be avoided by those who are grieving in the way that programmes whose content is flagged in advance can .
" in that context it considered that the final scene of a body smashing into its grave was unnecessary and had caused considerable distress to many viewers , " it said .
a microsoft spokeswoman said the advert would not be broadcast again but would continue to be used on the internet and in cinemas .
blood-sucking mosquitoes xbox has followed sony playstation 's lead in opting for adverts which range from the unusual to the surreal .
its first uk advert featured mosquitoes sucking blood in time to music .
the console has enjoyed only moderate sales since its uk launch .
by the end of june , microsoft expects to have " shipped " between 3.5 million and 4 million consoles globally .
its original estimate was 4.5 to six million .
