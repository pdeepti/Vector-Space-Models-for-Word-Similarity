its festival is , above all else , a celebration of cultural diversity .
wander the town or the eisteddfod site and you 'll hear dozens of languages , see countless national costumes and witness a friendly display of national pride by visitors from 47 countries across the globe .
in the past , they carried with them their different currencies , and local banks sold pounds for a whole range of colourful notes and coins .
it is self-evident that the euro is affecting britain and we must offer support to businesses ruth kelly , govt .
financial secretary much of that diversity remains , but continental visitors this year will all be bringing euros , and for the first time in the united kingdom , they 'll be able to use them - in shops , pubs , restaurants and around the eisteddfod field .
this seventh century site will therefore become part of the euro-zone , or rather a british colony for the euro empire across the channel .
martyn jones , the local labour mp , dreamt up the idea and is delighted with the support he 's secured .
the chamber of trade , tourism association , denbighshire county council , high street banks and the eisteddfod organisers are all on board .
so too are some powerful political players .
neil kinnock , vice president of the european commission , has endorsed it warmly .
" fifty six years ago llangollen led the world in establishing a fresh and creative way of strengthening understanding across borders with the international eisteddfod .
" obviously , the spirit of initiative is very much alive as llangollen becomes part of the eurozone for a week .
around 47 countries take part attracting around 100,0000 people " the result will be much greater convenience for visitors from 12 of our neighbouring countries and , for british people , the euro will be shown to be a usable currency that holds no mysteries and carries no threats .
everyone gains from that . "
the europe minister , peter hain , is similarly keen and even the treasury , more cautious than any other department about sounding remotely enthusiastic about the euro , have backed it warmly .
ruth kelly , the financial secretary , has described it as " an imaginative and innovative idea " and dared to reflect " it is self-evident that the euro is affecting britain and we must offer support to businesses in order to adequately adapt and deal with its impact .
this proposal does just that . "
llangollen is unlikely to influence the treasury 's assessment of its infamous five tests , but martin jones hopes it will help tilt the political argument in favour of the euro .
llangollen sits close to snowdonia national park " if we get people actually handling euros in banks and shops , then i think it will be seen as less foreign and dangerous .
it 's the vanguard of something that should be done throughout britain . "
two other towns are already considering following suit .
bath believes a similar scheme could help its own international music festival , and anglesey is eager to please tourists crossing it 's border en route to and from ireland by allowing them to use the euro in the port town of holyhead and elsewhere .
britain in europe , the pro-euro organisation , points out that such initiatives could be a major help to the 13 million visitors who come to the uk form the continent every year .
some local businesses are unhappy with the introduction of the zone .
despite its huge popularity the festival is running at a loss stuart davis has a euro-till in his gallery restaurant , and has been accepting different currencies there for long time .
but he complains that local people had not been properly consulted and is worried about the logistics of operating the zone .
without euro tills , calculating conversions would be a complicated , time consuming operation .

the criticisms were levelled at the lawyers ' body by linda costelloe baker , the scottish legal services ombudsman , in her annual report .
in two-thirds of the cases referred to her , she found the law society had failed to carry out an " adequate or well-managed investigation " into a solicitor .
the issues that matter most to a complainant can be overlooked linda costelloe baker ombudsman mrs costelloe baker said there had been a 57 % rise in the number of new complaints to her during the year about the law society and other legal bodies .
she said the law society had made " a welcome effort " to use plain english , and to encourage solicitors to communicate clearly with their clients .
but she stressed she remained concerned by the way in which it handled complaints .
she said : " my continuing concern about the way the law society responds to complaints is the complexity of the investigation process .
" that in itself can give an impression of bias - of being more in tune with the lawyer than the ordinary person . "
better system mrs costelloe added : " investigations take far too long and in the welter of correspondence , the issues that matter most to a complainant can be overlooked . "
she welcomed a scottish parliament inquiry into the handling of legal complaints , saying this could lead to a better system .
the ombudsman said : " in the meantime , the professional bodies must work fairly and efficiently within the current legislation and this annual report shows that there is still plenty of room for improvement . "
joe platt : " look at the wider picture " law society vice president joe platt said the holyrood inquiry had greatly increased the awareness of his organisation 's work and that of the ombudsman .
" it is important to look at the wider picture about complaints , " he said .
" solicitors in scotland deal with an estimated 1,000,000 transactions on behalf of clients every year and the law society of scotland received just over 1,200 complaints .
" of these , just over 150 complaints were referred to the ombudsman about the way the society handled the complaint , of which she reported on 74 and upheld 48 . "
he said proposed new legislation had been drawn up to allow the society to deal with complaints more quickly . watch / listen on this story bbc scotland 's isabel fraser reports " the law society says it is in no way complacent " see also : 25 sep 01 -pipe- scotland law society defends itself 19 nov 00 -pipe- scotland experts call for scottish law reform 09 nov 00 -pipe- scotland legal aid inquiry launched 05 sep 00 -pipe- scotland fight for your rights , scots told 31 jul 00 -pipe- scotland cheating solicitor barred 30 jun 99 -pipe- uk solicitor complaints ' out of control ' internet links : law society of scotland scottish consumer council scottish legal services ombudsman the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top scotland stories now : officer faces harbour death hearing minister grilled on fish catches for altnaharra read sahara university seeks to broaden appeal dancers urged to make the leap teenagers admit festival violence court hears ' secret society ' claims programme an auction winner links to more scotland stories are at the foot of the page .

dozens of workers were airlifted ashore after the incident which shut down production and left the platform with only emergency power .
the blast happened in one of three generators on the britannia platform , 130 miles north east of aberdeen .
a spokeswoman for owner britannia operator ltd said the explosion was contained within the generator , although some damage was done to the surrounding area .
none of the 150 staff on board was injured in the incident , which happened at about 1615 bst on monday .
the company said 78 non-essential personnel were airlifted to aberdeen or a nearby accommodation vessel .
a spokeswoman said the staff had been taken off the platform because the loss of power had led to reduced facilities - including hygiene and catering .

dozens of workers were airlifted ashore after the incident which shut down production and left the platform with only emergency power .
the blast happened in one of three generators on the britannia platform , 130 miles north east of aberdeen .
a spokeswoman for owner britannia operator ltd said the explosion was contained within the generator , although some damage was done to the surrounding area .
none of the 150 staff on board was injured in the incident , which happened at about 1615 bst on monday .
the company said 78 non-essential personnel were airlifted to aberdeen or a nearby accommodation vessel .
a spokeswoman said the staff had been taken off the platform because the loss of power had led to reduced facilities - including hygiene and catering .
" we have to assess the situation and see what damage has been done before the generators can go back online , " she added .
an investigation will be carried out by an on-board technical crew assisted by the health and safety executive .

a review into the industry , conducted by former lloyds of london chief ron sandler , is expected to call for sweeping reforms aimed at encouraging more britons to save .
mr sandler 's report is expected to criticise insurers and pension providers for imposing high charges , providing excessively complex products , and failing to compete with one another .
it is thought likely to call for the introduction of a range of simpler savings products which would be sold over the counter , a move which could favour banks and building societies over traditional pension providers .
greater simplification would allow savers to purchase products directly without having to rely on expensive , and highly regulated , professional financial advice .
confidence booster mr sandler is also expected to conclude that actively managed pension funds provide poor value and returns for savers , advising them to invest instead in passive ' tracker ' funds , which mirror stock market indices .
managed funds carry higher charges than tracker funds .
the review may also criticise ' with-profits ' pension policies - which even out stock market returns over a period of years - as complex and non-transparent .
the sandler reforms are designed to restore public faith in the financial services industry , battered by the 1990s pensions mis-selling scandal and the near-collapse of insurance group equitable life .
shoring up consumers ' confidence in the sector is seen as an essential step towards encouraging higher levels of retirement saving .
it is estimated that the money in uk pension funds currently falls short of the sum needed to provide savers with a comfortable retirement by about Â£ 28bn .
the sandler review was commissioned by the treasury in july 2001 .
insurers ' pain however , the sandler recommendations could cut into the profits generated by insurers and pension providers already struggling with plunging share prices .
" no only are they dealing with the falling footsie and the constant underlying current of lower margins , if you add on top of that the sandler review and it 's really a bad week for the life industry , " said mike riley , head of european life practice at consultants accenture .
some analysts believe that the reforms could trigger a wave of consolidation in the industry .

the new machine will allow doctors to see the metabolism occurring deep inside the body , showing them how the body actually works .
it is understood charitable donors put up more than Â£ 1.5m to buy and install the scanner .
it will allow faster diagnosis of tumours because malignant tumours have a much faster metabolism than benign growths .
the pet scanner can show accurately what stage the cancer is at , allowing consultants to decide whether surgery will be of benefit .
but its benefits do not end at cancer diagnosis .
the scanner can tell whether heart muscle has been irreparably damaged or look in detail at brain function . watch / listen on this story bbc ni 's health correspondent dot kirby : " the scanner can tell the difference between a benign and a malignant tumour " bbc ni 's health correspondent dot kirby : " doctors will be able to see the metabolism occurring deep inside the body " see also : 07 oct 99 -pipe- health tuning in to genius 16 oct 00 -pipe- health electric dreams reveal memory secrets 22 aug 00 -pipe- health all-seeing yet unseeing 07 aug 00 -pipe- health scans uncover ' music of the mind ' internet links : royal victoria hospital the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top n ireland stories now : nail bombs thrown at station omagh detectives make arrest orde defends inquiry comments warders still concerned at breach sdlp member ' being forced out ' jobs threat at council family claim attack was ' sectarian ' adair fails in prison challenge links to more n ireland stories are at the foot of the page .
