the only source of poisoning or contamination here that we are seeing for the last 25 years is aerial spraying of endosulphan " mohan kumar , local doctor these are the most obvious cases - but teachers here say almost half the children have illnesses , ranging from cerebral palsy and cancers to skin diseases and epilepsy .
the school 's teacher ramakrishnan told me , " the iq of the children in this area is lower than normal , and there is a definite problem with memory loss .
we tell them something one day and by the next , most of them can not remember . "
mohana kumar , the village doctor , became so concerned about the mysterious outbreak of health problems that he started a special log .
other villages in the area also report unusual problems .
he is now convinced he knows the cause .
" the only source of poisoning or contamination here that we are seeing for the last 25 years is aerial spraying of endosulphan on cashew plantations .
" it has been going on uninterrupted , thrice a year , using helicopters .
all this poison goes to their body systems and naturally they are affected . "
suspicions about the pesticide endosulphan grew when an indian environmental group carried out its own investigations .
its report recorded high levels of endosulphan in the local water , soil and plant samples .
raging debate the production of cashew nuts is big business in kerala - and growers say the pesticide endosulphan is an important way of protecting the crop .
it is currently used in 80 countries worldwide - and banned in 10 others .
local pesticide manufacturers say the environmental group 's report was inaccurate .
their representative , ganesan , says the allegations made by the environmentalists are very judgemental and do not stand scientific scrutiny .
the industry view is this compound has been in use around the world for more than 40 years and it gets periodically evaluated .
it is also reviewed before its registration in the respective countries .
the villagers say many of their houses are right by the cashew trees - so homes and water sources are bound to be affected by aerial spraying .
managers at the cashew nut plantation would not comment - but ganesan of the pesticide association did say aerial spraying of endosulphan is extremely unusual in india and not recommended by the industry .
uncertain future six months ago , the villagers won a short-term suspension of spraying - a ban the industry is now fighting .
the villagers admit they lack the resources to prove scientifically that endosulphan is the cause of their ruined health .
but with so much still unknown , they want a permanent ban .
shree padre , a farmer in the village who is a member of the anti-pesticide campaign , says , " already the area , in our soil , in our water , in our bodies , we fear a lot of pesticide residues are there and god only knows when it will by nature vanish from us . "
" so we do not want any pesticide to be sprayed on us by any means .
let them grow cashew organically . "
for many of padre 's school children , it is already too late .
both sides , villagers and industry , are calling for a public investigation to establish what really caused this devastation of health .
those answers might protect the next generation - and even bring compensation for those who will never be able to lead a normal life .

but mps will be allowed to breastfeed in specially-designated areas in the commons for the first time. this is a rare and wasted opportunity to set an example to women across the uk national childbirth trust special breastfeeding rooms are to be set up in the lady members ' rooms - close to the upper committee corridor .
speaker michael martin had been expected to overturn the ban entirely but decided against such a move after " broad consultation " with mps .
traditionalists ' victory the ruling is a victory for traditionalists , such as conservative mp julie kirkbride , one of a small group of mps with young children , who described the idea of breastfeeding in the commons as " ludicrous " .
but it will come as a blow to a group of mainly labour mps who have campaigned since 1997 to be allowed to nurse infants in the chamber .
labour backbencher julia drown said she was encouraged by the speaker 's recognition of the need for special facilities .
but she was " surprised " by his decision not to overturn the ban altogether .
drown : ' this is not the end of the road ' she said the commons administration committee had voted in favour of lifting the ban and , in polls , three-to-one mps were also in favour .
" i do n't think this is the end of the road i am sure we will get there in the end , " mrs drown said .
she called on mr martin to give mps a commons vote on the issue .
' wasted opportunity ' meanwhile the national childbirth trust said the speaker had wasted an opportunity to set an example to women about breastfeeding .
chief executive belinda phipps said she was extremely disappointed with the decision .
" as the commons is an open and public building , this is a rare and wasted opportunity to set an example to women across the uk that breastfeeding is and should be accepted in public places . "
visiting mothers the new arrangements could be in place within 10 weeks , if approved by the commons administration committee .
its chairman , conservative mp marion roe , is recommending acceptance .
the new rooms will be separate from but adjacent to nappy changing areas .
feeding chairs , footstools , and baby changers will be provided , along with disposable nappies , breast pads , tissues and disposable bins .
facilities will also be provided for visiting mothers .
the measures will cost just under Â£ 8,000 .
' responsibility ' in a letter to the committee , the speaker says he supports the " principle " of breast-feeding , and recognises the benefits it brings to babies and mothers .
but he says his responsibility is to the commons as a whole , and on balance has decided not to permit nursing mothers and babies in the chamber or in committee rooms .

shinsei bank came into being after the long-term credit bank - itself bankrupt thanks to its huge stable of bad loans - was sold in march 2000 to a consortium of us investors .
now it is taking steps to improve its financial position , and mortgage bank first credit corp has become a victim of the shake-up .
first credit - heavily indebted to shinsei - was found bankrupt by a district court .
observers said that the large number of companies unable to pay their debts hints that insolvency cases were likely to overhang the japanese economy for some years .
end of the road on friday , tokyo district court ruled that first credit owed creditors 12.7bn yen -lrb- $ 99.5m ; Â£ 69.9m -rrb- , more than it held in assets .
" now , through a fair and open rehabilitation process , we would like them to find an appropriate sponsor and enact a swift restructuring plan , " shinsei said in a statement .
when it filed to force the bankruptcy in december , shinsei was owed 126bn yen by first credit , whose total debt burden was 252.2bn yen .
shinsei had rejected a plan backed by many of the other 36 creditors , in which first credit had agreed to pay back 15bn yen .
difference of opinion first credit , though , fought to the last .
noting that it was the first listed japanese company to be forced into bankruptcy , first credit warned that shinsei 's actions could destroy confidence in the accounting methods of other listed groups .
" if a big creditor forces such proceedings , " said spokesman kazuo yamada , " the way of accounting can suddenly change , so what should investors believe ? "
according to its own calculations , first credit was still solvent , with assets worth 7.9bn yen more than its debts .
but its accounting practices valued its assets - such as its tokyo hq - at their purchase price , despite the fact that land and stock prices stand at a fraction of their levels of the late 1980s .
shinsei , meanwhile , was forced to deny that its actions were designed to allow it to sell the company 's debts back to the government as part of the latter 's economic restructuring plan .

the swansea project has received money directly from the assembly , bypassing the usual arts council of wales funding mechanism .
opposition parties plaid cymru and the conservatives are furious there was no discussion and the council has branded it a " shambles " for relations with cardiff bay .
but the assembly now appears to have backtracked on the cash promise , distributing the grant around the country .
the original announcement by the finance minister - made during her budget statement in november 2001 - came as a surprise to ams .
she said an annual Â£ 150,000 grant would be made available to fund " a chamber orchestra for wales " and to make chamber music " more accessible to communities . "
little scrutiny the orchestra made its debut performance in front of fewer than 100 people - and ms hart - on tuesday .
but critics have hit out at the wisdom of the minister 's decision , saying the project : was never scrutinised by the culture committee had not been announced by culture , language and sport minister jenny randerson did not come from the body charged with distributing public money to worthy arts projects did not feature in mrs randerson 's culture review , ' a culture in common , ' or her subsequent national strategy the arts council of wales has long held an aspiration to create a national chamber orchestra .
but angry council member geraint lewis told bbc radio wales : " public funding for any major institution has to go through tendering and be seen to be accountable .
" the culture committee should investigate to see why the money was taken from a budget other than the culture budget , where the money came from , where the decision was made and why the procedures were not taken through traditional methods .
" until recently , there was absolutely no extra funding available for this .
" policy is being made up without any reference to the appropriate committee and there is some kind of constituency link here . "
favouritsm allegations ms hart is the am for neighbouring gower and is facing allegations of favouritism .
the project is run by former swansea county council employee gruff harries .
he told bbc wales he was simply a " lucky recipient " after submitting a detailed business plan to the assembly .
it appears three or four similar arts bodies contacted jenny randerson to learn how they could bid for the cash .
she had promised other institutions could apply for awards .
and the administration appears to have had a change of policy , with the culture minsiter confirming thursday the cash was not for the one project but many across wales .
a statement indicated that the chamber orchestra of wales will now get only Â£ 20,000 for " set-up " costs .
opponents are again rounding on ms hart , following the debacle surrounding funding the assembly 's proposed new debating chamber .
opponents attack plaid cymru culture spokesman owen john thomas said : " it 's clearly outside her remit .
" her interest seems to be geographical as it 's near her constituency . "
and the tory am for south wales central , jonathan morgan , added : " at best , we can say this is a procedural irregularity - at worst it 's deeply suspicious . "
in february , ms hart came under fire from opposition members following a row with lord rogers , who was sacked as architect of the proposed assembly chamber building .
he accused the finance minister of giving a misleading account of an adjudication in his favour over unpaid fees , by continuing to claim that he had underestimated the cost of the project .

the swansea project has received money directly from the assembly , bypassing the usual arts council of wales funding mechanism .
critics are rounding on minister ms hart once again opposition parties plaid cymru and the conservatives are furious there was no discussion and the council has branded it a " shambles " for relations with cardiff bay .
but the assembly now appears to have backtracked on the cash promise , distributing the grant around the country .
the original announcement by the finance minister - made during her budget statement in november 2001 - came as a surprise to ams .
she said an annual Â£ 150,000 grant would be made available to fund " a chamber orchestra for wales " and to make chamber music " more accessible to communities . "
little scrutiny the orchestra made its debut performance in front of fewer than 100 people - and ms hart - on tuesday .
but critics have hit out at the wisdom of the minister 's decision , saying the project : was never scrutinised by the culture committee had not been announced by culture , language and sport minister jenny randerson did not come from the body charged with distributing public money to worthy arts projects did not feature in mrs randerson 's culture review , ' a culture in common , ' or her subsequent national strategy the arts council of wales has long held an aspiration to create a national chamber orchestra .
but angry council member geraint lewis told bbc radio wales : " public funding for any major institution has to go through tendering and be seen to be accountable .
" the culture committee should investigate to see why the money was taken from a budget other than the culture budget , where the money came from , where the decision was made and why the procedures were not taken through traditional methods .
" until recently , there was absolutely no extra funding available for this .
" policy is being made up without any reference to the appropriate committee and there is some kind of constituency link here . "
favouritsm allegations ms hart is the am for neighbouring gower and is facing allegations of favouritism .
the project is run by former swansea county council employee gruff harries .
he told bbc wales he was simply a " lucky recipient " after submitting a detailed business plan to the assembly .
jenny randerson had said other groups could apply it appears three or four similar arts bodies contacted jenny randerson to learn how they could bid for the cash .
she had promised other institutions could apply for awards .
and the administration appears to have had a change of policy , with the culture minsiter confirming thursday the cash was not for the one project but many across wales .
a statement indicated that the chamber orchestra of wales will now get only Â£ 20,000 for " set-up " costs .
opponents are again rounding on ms hart , following the debacle surrounding funding the assembly 's proposed new debating chamber .
opponents attack plaid cymru culture spokesman owen john thomas said : " it 's clearly outside her remit .
" her interest seems to be geographical as it 's near her constituency . "
and the tory am for south wales central , jonathan morgan , added : " at best , we can say this is a procedural irregularity - at worst it 's deeply suspicious . "
in february , ms hart came under fire from opposition members following a row with lord rogers , who was sacked as architect of the proposed assembly chamber building .
he accused the finance minister of giving a misleading account of an adjudication in his favour over unpaid fees , by continuing to claim that he had underestimated the cost of the project .

speaking during a middle eastern tour , mr o 'neill said the strength of the dollar and the plight of the steel business were separate issues .
" they just live in different worlds , " said mr o 'neill , a former head of us aluminium giant alcoa .
" the fact that the steel industry now has had for a long time a huge overcapacity is the overwhelming issue about the steel case . "
mr o 'neill has been dismissive of complaints from us manufacturers about the strong dollar ever since taking office , saying that good companies did not " live or die " by exchange rates .
manufacturers ' groups say the dollar is 30 % overvalued .
too much , too cheap while observers generally agree that the world steel industry produces too much to meet demand , the us protection measures have attracted criticism in countries from brazil to australia .
many have , with the european commission , complained to the world trade organisation over the 8-30 % tariffs slapped by the us on steel imports for the next three years .
the suggestion that the high value of the dollar was responsible for the us steel industry 's plight came from european central bank president wim duisenberg .
mr duisenberg dismissed as " deplorable " the us position that foreign governments ' subsidies for their own steel industries meant america needed to give its steel companies a breathing space to restructure .
many analysts agreed .
" what duisenberg said made perfect sense , " said joachim fels at morgan stanley in london .
" it is quite obvious that the steel sanctions have got something to do with the strength of the dollar .
" -lrb- it -rrb- is more over-valued than it has ever been in the past , more even than in the 1980s , and this is one reason why us manufacturers have these problems . "
oil price mr o 'neill also took the opportunity during his middle eastern visit to reiterate the us view that oil prices should not be allowed to rise too far .
the recovery in the us from the doldrums seen after the 11 september attacks has been assisted by low energy prices , and recent rises have been a cause for concern .
although opec , the 14-member oil producers ' cartel , has expressed desires for prices to stay in a $ 22-28 a barrel range , mr o 'neill said that the ideal was rather lower .
" a reasonable balance of $ 18 to $ 25 probably meets the test for sustainability , " he said .
" that way the us and the broader world will have a chance to return to a higher rate of real growth . "

"
it has nothing to do with greed .
i believe it has everything to do with valuing a lost loved one " compensation overseer kenneth feinberg kenneth feinberg , the fund 's overseer , made the announcement and other changes seen as being beneficial to family members as he set the final rules for qualification .
mr feinberg estimates that the average award now to family members will be about $ 1.85m - nearly $ 200,000 more than initially anticipated .
the increase is the result of changes he has made to the final regulations governing the fund , which was established by the government to try to discourage victims ' families from seeking damages .
the fund was set up as part of the $ 15bn airline assistance package passed by congress in the weeks after the attacks .
it is intended as an alternative to the courts for 11 september victims .
to receive an award from the fund a family must agree not to sue the airlines or other entities such as the world trade center .
us attorney general john ashcroft said : " over the past few months , the department and -lsb- kenneth feinberg -rsb- have worked tirelessly to develop a fund that is sensitive and fair to those who are suffering as a result of the terrorist attacks on our country .
" i believe this goal has been achieved . "
low take-up only 350 families have so far applied to take part in the government scheme , because of concerns that the cash awards were not enough .
now , others will have longer - until the end of next year - to decide if they will follow suit .
new york aid average payout : $ 1.85m airline bailout package : $ 15bn extra aid : $ 5.4bn the families of illegal immigrants will also now have an opportunity to claim this compensation , as will people who have sought medical treatment since the attacks .
for those injured , the rules previously limited eligibility to those who sought medical treatment within 24 hours of the attack .
the new rules extend that time to 72 hours and may be even longer for rescue workers on a case-by-case basis , mr feinberg said .
this may allow rescue workers injured in the clear-up operation some access to financial help .
dozens of offices open on friday to begin handling families ' requests .
most of the offices will be in the new york area , where some 2,800 of the more than 3,000 people killed in the attacks died .
president bush on thursday pledged an additional $ 5.4bn in aid to help new york recover from the attacks , raising the total promised us assistance to new york city and state to over $ 20bn .
