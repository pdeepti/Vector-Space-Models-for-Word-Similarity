at the same time , in all but the most affected countries , student populations continue to grow , increasing the demand for teachers .
the disease is adding millions of dollars to the cost of expanding education in the world 's poorest countries .
the author of the study said the challenge is to expand education in spite of the impact of aids on the ranks of teachers because education is key to stemming the spread of the disease .
africa hit hard by the end of 2001 , unaids estimated that more than 40 million people were living with hiv and aids , with about 5 million new infections last year .
sub-saharan africa has been hardest hit , and the study shows the disease is ravaging the ranks of teachers there .
hiv / aids in africa 2001 5m new infections 2.3m deaths 28m living with aids life expectancy : 47 years without aids : 62 years 44 % of pregnant urban women in botswana hiv + some 12 % of teachers in south africa , 19 % of teachers in zambia and 30 % of teachers in botswana are infected with the virus that causes aids , said professor donald bundy , the lead author of the study .
in zambia , aids is killing 1,000 teachers a year - which until last year was equal to the total output of the nation 's teacher colleges .
even before it kills , aids ravages the ranks of teachers .
during the average 10-year course of the disease , aids leads to high levels of teacher absenteeism , and these teachers are often not replaced .
in botswana , funeral attendance is second only to illness in aids-related absenteeism amongst teachers .
in countries most impacted by the disease , many schools struggle with only one or two teachers where there should be 10 , dr bundy said .
and despite high adult mortality rates , in all but six of the hardest hit countries , student populations are still increasing , which means the demand for teachers continues to increase .
education stops spread in the poorest countries of the world , 113 million children do not attend school .
" everyone is trying to improve education , and aids is making that battle that much harder , " dr bundy said .
of the 55 countries that the world bank believes are unlikely to achieve education for all , 31 are those worst affected by aids .
and in those countries hardest hit by aids , the disease will add half a billion dollars to the finance gap that those countries need to achieve education for all of their children .
studies have shown that education slows the spread of aids but dr bundy is hopeful that education can still be used to slow rates of infection and keep children who are not infected from contracting hiv .
there are many studies that show that education decreases the rates of infection , he said .
" in zambia in the 1990s , hiv infection rates fell by almost half amongst educated women , while there was little or no decline in women who had n't gone to school , " dr bundy said .
the world bank study says universal basic education is critical to stemming the spread of hiv and that girls and an increasing number of aids orphans must be guaranteed an education .
despite the grim numbers , " we do have a window of hope , " dr bundy said .
even in countries with the highest infection rates - botswana , namibia and swaziland - most school-aged children are not infected , he said , and " there is no reason that these children should ever become infected " . watch / listen on this story red cross head of health dr alvaro bermejo " the stigma is fuelling the epidemic " regional picture africa devastated european hotspots background what is aids ?

categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : europe front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 8 may , 2002 , 04:20 gmt 05:20 uk analysis : how will fortuyn be remembered ?
fortuyn transformed the dull politics of the netherlands by john simpson bbc world affairs editor pim fortuyn stepped onto the dutch national political centre-stage in february , when he founded his anti-immigration party , the pim fortuyn list , and by early may he was dead .
fortuyn gave rise to hate in those three months he transformed the dull , predictable politics of the netherlands .
he claimed to resent any comparison with other extreme right-wing leaders , and particularly jean-marie le pen in france .
during our interview in rotterdam last week , shortly before his death , he threatened three times to walk out when i mentioned their names and asked him if he was a racist .
' archetypical right winger ' but he did not .
publicity was too important for him to throw away .
whatever his public statements , he shared most of mr le pen 's views , except on the question of israel .
but he knew that he would soon become the most important politician in the country , and was clearly expecting to win 28 % or more of the vote in the next week 's election .
therefore he toned down some of his views to suit a broader electorate .
but in many ways - his avowed homosexuality apart - fortuyn was an archetypical right-winger .
he had the same frank , sarcastic humour as mr le pen , and there was a similar air of menace to some of his younger supporters , as there is to some of mr le pen 's .
contempt for media his deputy was a black immigrant from the former portuguese colony of cape verde ; mr le pen has also had prominent black candidates in his entourage .
the pim fortuyn list was his personal vehicle , just as the national front is mr le pen 's .
his confidence was as superb as his manners , his house and his way of dressing .
in a country where every educated person speaks english , fortuyn was unusual ; his english was rather halting , and he would have done better to answer my questions in dutch .
but he had clearly developed a contempt for journalists , and he had never had to face a really attacking interview before .
he was floored more than once , and lost his temper ; always a mistake in dealing with the media .
' courage ' but fortuyn was not short of courage .
he kept his beautiful house in rotterdam , even though it had become surrounded by housing estates where immigrants lived .
thousands have marched in remembrance of the slain politician other rotterdam politicians headed off to the wealthier outer suburbs .
his own opinions , which seemed so violent to his opponents in the netherlands , sometimes attracted an equal degree of violence from them .
he knew the dangers to himself , but said he could not afford the cost of a round-the-clock bodyguard .
the police did not seem to feel he was in any danger .
spectacular loner his death leaves the netherlands badly divided , angry , and frightened at what has happened to the peaceful quality of political life .
as for his party , it may well get a big sympathy vote when the elections come round , but it is highly unlikely to last long without him .
his success was brief and brilliant , he was a spectacular loner , who is more likely to be remembered for the hatred he gave rise to than for his own achievements . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's john simpson meets pim fortuyn in an interview recorded before his death key stories dutch mystified interview with fortuyn reaction in pictures murder suspect fortuyn legacy background fortuyn obituary immigration message new leader search political crossroads changing landscape rise of the right factfile right wing in europe talking point is the assassination a political watershed ?

the government has said it wants to scrap the law banning large newspaper groups from buying channel 5 and radio licences .
but newspaper groups would still be barred from owning a significant stake in the mass-market itv . "
outdated rules on media ownership have hampered growth and adaptation for too long " kim howells culture minister culture secretary tessa jowell announced the proposals as she unveiled the government 's long-awaited communications bill in the commons on tuesday .
the bill potentially clears the way for the two biggest itv companies , carlton and granada , to merge .
it also sets out tougher regulations for the bbc , to create a level-playing field with commercial broadcasters .
it would also allow media moguls from outside the eu to buy some broadcasting companies .
protecting diversity " for far too long the uk 's media have been over-regulated and over-protected from competition , " ms jowell told mps .
she said she wanted liberalise the market but at the same time protect the diversity and plurality of the uk 's media .
due to the complex nature of the government 's proposals there would be further period of consultation with the media industry and full scrutiny by both houses of parliament , she stressed .
the draft bill proposes a new " light touch " regulator ofcom - to replace existing bodies such as the independent television commission -lrb- itc -rrb- and telecom regulator oftel .
this would act as a " one-stop " shop for all complaints .
under the proposals , companies outside the eu would be able to bid for itv companies for the first time .
but regional itv programmes would be protected by core safeguards designed to ensure there are a " range of voices " locally and nationally .
itn concern carlton and granada would no longer be prevented from merging by media law - but they would still be subject to competition commission scrutiny . "
