it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .
local authorities on germany ’ s north sea coast are already bracing themselves for a large-scale epidemic .
but given the lethality of the virus , local crisis management will most likely be reduced to one measure : the removal of carcasses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

at the franco-german summit , held in the eastern german city of schwerin , the two powerful european neighbors signed an agreement providing for the integration of the two national military satellite systems , germany 's sar-lupe and france 's helio ii .
they said other european states would be invited to join the collaboration . "
" common european solutions will contribute to the strengthening of the independent and capable industrial and technological defense foundation that europe needs , " the two governments said in the declaration that they issued at the close of what is the 79th of their twice-yearly summits .
the two countries ' support for the development of a european satellite platform independent of the u.s. platform is founded in their experiences during the balkan conflicts , when the supply of satellite pictures from the u.s. system proved unreliable .
germany and france said they also plan to move towards common european defense planning and arms procurement .
in this connection , both sides reaffirmed their support for the a400m military transport plane , to be built by european defense consortium eads .
armaments experts believe that the privatization plans of the french government will provide impetus in the country 's defense collaboration with germany .

recently-released statistics paint a grim picture of the economic future of germany 's youth and have sent chancellor gerhard schröder rushing to remedy the situation before elections . the effects of germany 's economic slump have wound their way down to the country 's youth .
in what is seen as another damaging blow to chancellor gerhard schröder 's re-election hopes on september 22 , the federal labor office released statistics showing a major drop in the amount of apprenticeships available to secondary school graduates .
there are 10,000 fewer positions available compared to last year , according to the labor office .
employment offices have also registered a 6.4 percent drop in the amount of jobs they set up .
the numbers present the second statistical blow to germany 's youth in the past year .
in 2001 , the oecd-sponsored pisa education study ranked germany a disappointing 25 out of 32 countries .
the results were shocking for a country that had always taken pride in its superior educational system .
empty hope for german youth with thousands of german youngsters facing an uncertain future , schröder has weighed in , firing off a letter to german industry leaders reminding them of their duty to provide apprenticeship-opportunities for the country 's low-skilled youth .
" those that demand the immigration of highly-skilled workers , need to also be ready to do everything possible to offer the people here all possible apprenticeship and training opportunities , " he wrote to the association of german industry and chambers of commerce .
the chancellor was backed up in his argument by germany 's biggest unions , who reminded industry leaders that they had a duty to provide employment opportunities for germany 's youth .
training a vital step to secure future german teenagers typically apply for vocational training between the ages of 15 and 19 , following graduation from their secondary school . the training , which usually lasts a few years , is considered a vital step in securing a job in their field for the long-term .
schröder 's government has managed to keep the number of training positions fairly steady in the past two years .
drops in positions in craft-related-fields like carpentry were typically offset by yearly gains in the amount of positions available in the industrial and commercial sector .
but those numbers have fallen this year as well .
industry : youth not qualified enough industry leaders say pisa has reared its ugly head in applications for training positions .
the head of the industry association , ludwig georg braun , said the education level of many graduates is " poor . "
" many graduates ca n't fill complicated positions , " braun wrote in a reply to schröder 's open letter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 31.07.2002 germany still on the fence in possible iraq attack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can germany 's overstretched military forces afford another commitment in iraq ?
u.s. plans for an assault against iraq are becoming increasingly concrete .
britain has already stated its support for the action .
germany , though , says its military has its hands full .
but does it have a choice ? german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have repeatedly made it clear that berlin 's center-left coalition government will not participate in a u.s.-led attack on iraq .
but washington continues to put pressure on its european allies .
only britain has said it will support such a move .
from a military perspective , germany says its capabilities are exhausted .
peacekeeping troops are stationed in the balkans and germany is assisting operations in afghanistan , the latter marking the first deployment for combat operations outside of europe since 1945 .
although this may be the case , the nation 's political relevance in nato and as a u.s. ally can not be ignored .
in an interview with dw-world , dr. jochen hippler from the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg suggests that germany ultimately will be part of the war against iraq , even without combat troops .
what are the political implications of germany 's possible involvement in a u.s.-led attack on iraq ?
with federal elections approaching in september , the german government is interested in lying low .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer know that praising an adventure in iraq would not be beneficial for their election campaign .
on the other hand , the government does not want to make any public statements that could be picked up by the opposition as anti-american .
any sort of remarks against president bush could make the opposition candidate edmund stoiber look like the real transatlantic friend .
so it 's a fine line they 're walking with respect to domestic policy .
but does germany really have a choice , considering its powerful position in europe ?
foreign policy is another matter .
from this point of view , germany will take part , no matter how absurd the government finds an assault on iraq .
decisions on these types of military deployment are based on alliances .
they are a signal to germany 's western allies .
it also has significance for transatlantic relations , as it 's important to stay on the good side of the world 's most powerful nation .
you say it 's a fine line for germany to walk on in an election year .
what if we see a change in government in september , with a possible coalition of the conservative christian democrats cdu , their bavarian sister party csu and the free democrats fdp ?
will that have an impact on german involvement in iraq ?
i do n't think it will make such a difference in this case .
germany will participate in an assault against iraq , whether the cdu / fdp or the current government is in power .
but , in my opinion , it will certainly not involve active participation of german combat troops .
there are , though , many other ways germany could support the attack on iraq , too .
germany has stationed troops in kuwait , employing abc tanks for assisting in the detection of chemical and biological weapons .
these could support u.s. soldiers , for example .
or , if u.s. warships pull out of the mediterranean into the persian gulf , german vessels could replace their positions .
but even providing u.s. troops with military bases in germany is also – legally speaking – participating in a war .
and germany would never refuse this service , no matter if the government sees the war on iraq as right or wrong .
no timetable has been set for military action , yet .
some members of u.s. congress , including conservative republicans , are beginning to urge president bush to explain his reasoning and goals before committing american forces to topple a foreign government that has not attacked the u.s. the same holds true for its european allies .
how can the public be convinced that saddam hussein poses an intolerable threat to the u.s. and its allies ?
i do n't think there will be any action until next spring .
there certainly needs to be a better political pretense and diplomatic preparation is still necessary .
the argument that iraq is producing weapons of mass destruction is an absurd argument for a war .
i am certain that at some point some sort of connection will materialize showing saddam hussein as the " little brother " of osama bin laden .
such documents will , of course , not be made public .
and whether they are even true is a different matter .
but by the time that is clarified , five years will have passed and the war would be over by then , anyway .
such a development would make it easier for the german government to say : yes , we are going to be part of this .
a direct connection between saddam hussein and terrorism makes it easier to rally emotional support . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links institute for development and peace further information on the institute 's activities , publications and researchers .

it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .

analysts welcomed the move , saying it could only boost confidence in the group . volkswagen ag on tuesday revised down its full-year profit outlook – and was rewarded by the markets and applauded by analysts .
in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .
arndt ellinghorst , automobiles analyst at westlb , described the profit warning as " the right thing to do " .
he said it had boosted confidence in the group 's management .
" this is just what the market wanted to see " , said christian breitsprecher at deutsche bank .
volkswagen said it expected a pretax profit of " around 4 billion euro " for the full year , in a move that represents the abandonment of previous forecasts that it would match last year 's record 4.4 billion euro .
to soften the blow , the car maker unveiled first-half results that beat expectations .
the company said second-quarter pretax profits had risen 13.5 percent on the year to 1.266 billion euro .
this left its first-half result at 2.26 billion euro , down 4.4 percent on the year .
" the results are better than expected " , said georg stürzer at hvb group .
he said the wolfsburg-based autos giant had done particularly well to raise its returns in its operating business .
the 13.5 percent earnings growth seen in the second quarter had been won at a time when sales revenue had risen just 1 percent to 227 billion euro .
at the start of the year , the group had said it expected an economic recovery in the second half , but it said it had since become clear that this expectation would not be borne out .
" an improvement is highly unlikely " , said chief executive bernd pischetsrieder .
but he stressed that the new guidance was still conservative .
globally , car sales have fallen on all important markets , and this development has hit volkswagen hard .
it is also one of the european companies which has been most affected by the downturn in the key markets of latin america .
its first-half unit sales on the brazilian market were down 17 percent on the year .
worse still has been the impact on truck maker scania , in which vw holds a sizeable share .
the swedish company 's first-half orders from latin america were down 58 percent on the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

analysts welcomed the move , saying it could only boost confidence in the group . volkswagen ag on tuesday revised down its full-year profit outlook – and was rewarded by the markets and applauded by analysts .
in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .
arndt ellinghorst , automobiles analyst at westlb , described the profit warning as " the right thing to do " .
he said it had boosted confidence in the group 's management .
" this is just what the market wanted to see " , said christian breitsprecher at deutsche bank .
volkswagen said it expected a pretax profit of " around 4 billion euro " for the full year , in a move that represents the abandonment of previous forecasts that it would match last year 's record 4.4 billion euro .
to soften the blow , the car maker unveiled first-half results that beat expectations .
the company said second-quarter pretax profits had risen 13.5 percent on the year to 1.266 billion euro .
this left its first-half result at 2.26 billion euro , down 4.4 percent on the year .
" the results are better than expected " , said georg stürzer at hvb group .
he said the wolfsburg-based autos giant had done particularly well to raise its returns in its operating business .
the 13.5 percent earnings growth seen in the second quarter had been won at a time when sales revenue had risen just 1 percent to 227 billion euro .
at the start of the year , the group had said it expected an economic recovery in the second half , but it said it had since become clear that this expectation would not be borne out .
" an improvement is highly unlikely " , said chief executive bernd pischetsrieder .
but he stressed that the new guidance was still conservative .
globally , car sales have fallen on all important markets , and this development has hit volkswagen hard .
it is also one of the european companies which has been most affected by the downturn in the key markets of latin america .
its first-half unit sales on the brazilian market were down 17 percent on the year .

it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .
local authorities on germany ’ s north sea coast are already bracing themselves for a large-scale epidemic .
but given the lethality of the virus , local crisis management will most likely be reduced to one measure : the removal of carcasses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .

it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .

recently-released statistics paint a grim picture of the economic future of germany 's youth and have sent chancellor gerhard schröder rushing to remedy the situation before elections . the effects of germany 's economic slump have wound their way down to the country 's youth .
in what is seen as another damaging blow to chancellor gerhard schröder 's re-election hopes on september 22 , the federal labor office released statistics showing a major drop in the amount of apprenticeships available to secondary school graduates .
there are 10,000 fewer positions available compared to last year , according to the labor office .
employment offices have also registered a 6.4 percent drop in the amount of jobs they set up .
the numbers present the second statistical blow to germany 's youth in the past year .
in 2001 , the oecd-sponsored pisa education study ranked germany a disappointing 25 out of 32 countries .
the results were shocking for a country that had always taken pride in its superior educational system .
empty hope for german youth with thousands of german youngsters facing an uncertain future , schröder has weighed in , firing off a letter to german industry leaders reminding them of their duty to provide apprenticeship-opportunities for the country 's low-skilled youth .
" those that demand the immigration of highly-skilled workers , need to also be ready to do everything possible to offer the people here all possible apprenticeship and training opportunities , " he wrote to the association of german industry and chambers of commerce .
the chancellor was backed up in his argument by germany 's biggest unions , who reminded industry leaders that they had a duty to provide employment opportunities for germany 's youth .
training a vital step to secure future german teenagers typically apply for vocational training between the ages of 15 and 19 , following graduation from their secondary school . the training , which usually lasts a few years , is considered a vital step in securing a job in their field for the long-term .
schröder 's government has managed to keep the number of training positions fairly steady in the past two years .
drops in positions in craft-related-fields like carpentry were typically offset by yearly gains in the amount of positions available in the industrial and commercial sector .
but those numbers have fallen this year as well .
industry : youth not qualified enough industry leaders say pisa has reared its ugly head in applications for training positions .
the head of the industry association , ludwig georg braun , said the education level of many graduates is " poor . "
" many graduates ca n't fill complicated positions , " braun wrote in a reply to schröder 's open letter .
still , braun promised that industry would do more to create apprenticeships in the coming months .

at the franco-german summit , held in the eastern german city of schwerin , the two powerful european neighbors signed an agreement providing for the integration of the two national military satellite systems , germany 's sar-lupe and france 's helio ii .
they said other european states would be invited to join the collaboration . "
" common european solutions will contribute to the strengthening of the independent and capable industrial and technological defense foundation that europe needs , " the two governments said in the declaration that they issued at the close of what is the 79th of their twice-yearly summits .
the two countries ' support for the development of a european satellite platform independent of the u.s. platform is founded in their experiences during the balkan conflicts , when the supply of satellite pictures from the u.s. system proved unreliable .
germany and france said they also plan to move towards common european defense planning and arms procurement .
in this connection , both sides reaffirmed their support for the a400m military transport plane , to be built by european defense consortium eads .
armaments experts believe that the privatization plans of the french government will provide impetus in the country 's defense collaboration with germany .
in the past , according to german defense-industry insiders , the state influence over the country 's defense companies has worked against these companies ' involvement in mergers .
in consequence , german firms have had to look to other european union countries or to the u.s. for a merger partner .
in schwerin , a spokesman for president jacques chirac made it clear that the state plans to withdraw from the country 's armaments concerns .
so , for example , its 100 % stake in aerospace engine maker snecma sa will be put up for sale , as will its 15 % stake in thales , formerly known as thomson-csf , the paris-based defense and civil electronics group .
one interest that the state wo n't put up for sale is its stake in giat , the tanks maker .

analysts welcomed the move , saying it could only boost confidence in the group . volkswagen ag on tuesday revised down its full-year profit outlook – and was rewarded by the markets and applauded by analysts .
in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .
arndt ellinghorst , automobiles analyst at westlb , described the profit warning as " the right thing to do " .
he said it had boosted confidence in the group 's management .
" this is just what the market wanted to see " , said christian breitsprecher at deutsche bank .
volkswagen said it expected a pretax profit of " around 4 billion euro " for the full year , in a move that represents the abandonment of previous forecasts that it would match last year 's record 4.4 billion euro .
to soften the blow , the car maker unveiled first-half results that beat expectations .
the company said second-quarter pretax profits had risen 13.5 percent on the year to 1.266 billion euro .
this left its first-half result at 2.26 billion euro , down 4.4 percent on the year .
" the results are better than expected " , said georg stürzer at hvb group .
he said the wolfsburg-based autos giant had done particularly well to raise its returns in its operating business .
the 13.5 percent earnings growth seen in the second quarter had been won at a time when sales revenue had risen just 1 percent to 227 billion euro .
at the start of the year , the group had said it expected an economic recovery in the second half , but it said it had since become clear that this expectation would not be borne out .
" an improvement is highly unlikely " , said chief executive bernd pischetsrieder .
but he stressed that the new guidance was still conservative .
globally , car sales have fallen on all important markets , and this development has hit volkswagen hard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany and france forge stronger bond from arch foes to friendly neighbors savoir vivre on wheels mutually beneficial eu reform debate tops franco-german summit agenda europe -pipe- 31.07.2002 berlin , paris plan new joint defense projects großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac , -lrb- right -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- agree to greater defense cooperation germany and france on tuesday agreed to integrate their national military satellite systems as part of a new emphasis on european union security and defense coordination . germany and france on tuesday agreed to boost european union security and defense coordination in an effort to increase europe 's independence from the united states .
at the franco-german summit , held in the eastern german city of schwerin , the two powerful european neighbors signed an agreement providing for the integration of the two national military satellite systems , germany 's sar-lupe and france 's helio ii .
they said other european states would be invited to join the collaboration . "
" common european solutions will contribute to the strengthening of the independent and capable industrial and technological defense foundation that europe needs , " the two governments said in the declaration that they issued at the close of what is the 79th of their twice-yearly summits .
the two countries ' support for the development of a european satellite platform independent of the u.s. platform is founded in their experiences during the balkan conflicts , when the supply of satellite pictures from the u.s. system proved unreliable .
germany and france said they also plan to move towards common european defense planning and arms procurement .
in this connection , both sides reaffirmed their support for the a400m military transport plane , to be built by european defense consortium eads .
armaments experts believe that the privatization plans of the french government will provide impetus in the country 's defense collaboration with germany .
in the past , according to german defense-industry insiders , the state influence over the country 's defense companies has worked against these companies ' involvement in mergers .
in consequence , german firms have had to look to other european union countries or to the u.s. for a merger partner .
in schwerin , a spokesman for president jacques chirac made it clear that the state plans to withdraw from the country 's armaments concerns .
so , for example , its 100 % stake in aerospace engine maker snecma sa will be put up for sale , as will its 15 % stake in thales , formerly known as thomson-csf , the paris-based defense and civil electronics group .
one interest that the state wo n't put up for sale is its stake in giat , the tanks maker .
giat produces leclerc , the less profitable rival to krauss-maffei wegmann 's leopard tanks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu reform debate tops franco-german summit agenda at a summit this week in schwerin , president jacqués chirac and chancellor gerhard schröder are seeking to end a dispute over agricultural subsidy cuts that threaten to delay eastward expansion of the european union .

recently-released statistics paint a grim picture of the economic future of germany 's youth and have sent chancellor gerhard schröder rushing to remedy the situation before elections . the effects of germany 's economic slump have wound their way down to the country 's youth .
in what is seen as another damaging blow to chancellor gerhard schröder 's re-election hopes on september 22 , the federal labor office released statistics showing a major drop in the amount of apprenticeships available to secondary school graduates .
there are 10,000 fewer positions available compared to last year , according to the labor office .
employment offices have also registered a 6.4 percent drop in the amount of jobs they set up .
the numbers present the second statistical blow to germany 's youth in the past year .
in 2001 , the oecd-sponsored pisa education study ranked germany a disappointing 25 out of 32 countries .
the results were shocking for a country that had always taken pride in its superior educational system .
empty hope for german youth with thousands of german youngsters facing an uncertain future , schröder has weighed in , firing off a letter to german industry leaders reminding them of their duty to provide apprenticeship-opportunities for the country 's low-skilled youth .
" those that demand the immigration of highly-skilled workers , need to also be ready to do everything possible to offer the people here all possible apprenticeship and training opportunities , " he wrote to the association of german industry and chambers of commerce .
the chancellor was backed up in his argument by germany 's biggest unions , who reminded industry leaders that they had a duty to provide employment opportunities for germany 's youth .
training a vital step to secure future german teenagers typically apply for vocational training between the ages of 15 and 19 , following graduation from their secondary school . the training , which usually lasts a few years , is considered a vital step in securing a job in their field for the long-term .
schröder 's government has managed to keep the number of training positions fairly steady in the past two years .
drops in positions in craft-related-fields like carpentry were typically offset by yearly gains in the amount of positions available in the industrial and commercial sector .
but those numbers have fallen this year as well .
industry : youth not qualified enough industry leaders say pisa has reared its ugly head in applications for training positions .
the head of the industry association , ludwig georg braun , said the education level of many graduates is " poor . "
" many graduates ca n't fill complicated positions , " braun wrote in a reply to schröder 's open letter .
still , braun promised that industry would do more to create apprenticeships in the coming months .

analysts welcomed the move , saying it could only boost confidence in the group . volkswagen ag on tuesday revised down its full-year profit outlook – and was rewarded by the markets and applauded by analysts .
in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .

it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .
local authorities on germany ’ s north sea coast are already bracing themselves for a large-scale epidemic .
but given the lethality of the virus , local crisis management will most likely be reduced to one measure : the removal of carcasses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

analysts welcomed the move , saying it could only boost confidence in the group . volkswagen ag on tuesday revised down its full-year profit outlook – and was rewarded by the markets and applauded by analysts .
in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .
arndt ellinghorst , automobiles analyst at westlb , described the profit warning as " the right thing to do " .
he said it had boosted confidence in the group 's management .
" this is just what the market wanted to see " , said christian breitsprecher at deutsche bank .
volkswagen said it expected a pretax profit of " around 4 billion euro " for the full year , in a move that represents the abandonment of previous forecasts that it would match last year 's record 4.4 billion euro .
to soften the blow , the car maker unveiled first-half results that beat expectations .
the company said second-quarter pretax profits had risen 13.5 percent on the year to 1.266 billion euro .
this left its first-half result at 2.26 billion euro , down 4.4 percent on the year .
" the results are better than expected " , said georg stürzer at hvb group .
he said the wolfsburg-based autos giant had done particularly well to raise its returns in its operating business .
the 13.5 percent earnings growth seen in the second quarter had been won at a time when sales revenue had risen just 1 percent to 227 billion euro .
at the start of the year , the group had said it expected an economic recovery in the second half , but it said it had since become clear that this expectation would not be borne out .
" an improvement is highly unlikely " , said chief executive bernd pischetsrieder .
but he stressed that the new guidance was still conservative .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 31.07.2002 germany still on the fence in possible iraq attack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can germany 's overstretched military forces afford another commitment in iraq ?
u.s. plans for an assault against iraq are becoming increasingly concrete .
britain has already stated its support for the action .
germany , though , says its military has its hands full .
but does it have a choice ? german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have repeatedly made it clear that berlin 's center-left coalition government will not participate in a u.s.-led attack on iraq .
but washington continues to put pressure on its european allies .
only britain has said it will support such a move .
from a military perspective , germany says its capabilities are exhausted .
peacekeeping troops are stationed in the balkans and germany is assisting operations in afghanistan , the latter marking the first deployment for combat operations outside of europe since 1945 .
although this may be the case , the nation 's political relevance in nato and as a u.s. ally can not be ignored .
in an interview with dw-world , dr. jochen hippler from the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg suggests that germany ultimately will be part of the war against iraq , even without combat troops .
what are the political implications of germany 's possible involvement in a u.s.-led attack on iraq ?
with federal elections approaching in september , the german government is interested in lying low .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer know that praising an adventure in iraq would not be beneficial for their election campaign .
on the other hand , the government does not want to make any public statements that could be picked up by the opposition as anti-american .
any sort of remarks against president bush could make the opposition candidate edmund stoiber look like the real transatlantic friend .
so it 's a fine line they 're walking with respect to domestic policy .
but does germany really have a choice , considering its powerful position in europe ?
foreign policy is another matter .
from this point of view , germany will take part , no matter how absurd the government finds an assault on iraq .
decisions on these types of military deployment are based on alliances .
they are a signal to germany 's western allies .
it also has significance for transatlantic relations , as it 's important to stay on the good side of the world 's most powerful nation .
you say it 's a fine line for germany to walk on in an election year .
what if we see a change in government in september , with a possible coalition of the conservative christian democrats cdu , their bavarian sister party csu and the free democrats fdp ?
will that have an impact on german involvement in iraq ?
i do n't think it will make such a difference in this case .
germany will participate in an assault against iraq , whether the cdu / fdp or the current government is in power .
but , in my opinion , it will certainly not involve active participation of german combat troops .
there are , though , many other ways germany could support the attack on iraq , too .
germany has stationed troops in kuwait , employing abc tanks for assisting in the detection of chemical and biological weapons .
these could support u.s. soldiers , for example .
or , if u.s. warships pull out of the mediterranean into the persian gulf , german vessels could replace their positions .
but even providing u.s. troops with military bases in germany is also – legally speaking – participating in a war .
and germany would never refuse this service , no matter if the government sees the war on iraq as right or wrong .
no timetable has been set for military action , yet .
some members of u.s. congress , including conservative republicans , are beginning to urge president bush to explain his reasoning and goals before committing american forces to topple a foreign government that has not attacked the u.s. the same holds true for its european allies .
how can the public be convinced that saddam hussein poses an intolerable threat to the u.s. and its allies ?
i do n't think there will be any action until next spring .
there certainly needs to be a better political pretense and diplomatic preparation is still necessary .
the argument that iraq is producing weapons of mass destruction is an absurd argument for a war .
i am certain that at some point some sort of connection will materialize showing saddam hussein as the " little brother " of osama bin laden .
such documents will , of course , not be made public .
and whether they are even true is a different matter .
but by the time that is clarified , five years will have passed and the war would be over by then , anyway .
such a development would make it easier for the german government to say : yes , we are going to be part of this .
a direct connection between saddam hussein and terrorism makes it easier to rally emotional support . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links institute for development and peace further information on the institute 's activities , publications and researchers . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 31.07.2002 germany still on the fence in possible iraq attack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can germany 's overstretched military forces afford another commitment in iraq ?
u.s. plans for an assault against iraq are becoming increasingly concrete .
britain has already stated its support for the action .
germany , though , says its military has its hands full .
but does it have a choice ? german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have repeatedly made it clear that berlin 's center-left coalition government will not participate in a u.s.-led attack on iraq .
but washington continues to put pressure on its european allies .
only britain has said it will support such a move .
from a military perspective , germany says its capabilities are exhausted .
peacekeeping troops are stationed in the balkans and germany is assisting operations in afghanistan , the latter marking the first deployment for combat operations outside of europe since 1945 .
although this may be the case , the nation 's political relevance in nato and as a u.s. ally can not be ignored .
in an interview with dw-world , dr. jochen hippler from the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg suggests that germany ultimately will be part of the war against iraq , even without combat troops .
what are the political implications of germany 's possible involvement in a u.s.-led attack on iraq ?
with federal elections approaching in september , the german government is interested in lying low .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer know that praising an adventure in iraq would not be beneficial for their election campaign .
on the other hand , the government does not want to make any public statements that could be picked up by the opposition as anti-american .
any sort of remarks against president bush could make the opposition candidate edmund stoiber look like the real transatlantic friend .
so it 's a fine line they 're walking with respect to domestic policy .
but does germany really have a choice , considering its powerful position in europe ?
foreign policy is another matter .
from this point of view , germany will take part , no matter how absurd the government finds an assault on iraq .
decisions on these types of military deployment are based on alliances .
they are a signal to germany 's western allies .
it also has significance for transatlantic relations , as it 's important to stay on the good side of the world 's most powerful nation .
you say it 's a fine line for germany to walk on in an election year .
what if we see a change in government in september , with a possible coalition of the conservative christian democrats cdu , their bavarian sister party csu and the free democrats fdp ?
will that have an impact on german involvement in iraq ?
i do n't think it will make such a difference in this case .
germany will participate in an assault against iraq , whether the cdu / fdp or the current government is in power .
but , in my opinion , it will certainly not involve active participation of german combat troops .
there are , though , many other ways germany could support the attack on iraq , too .
germany has stationed troops in kuwait , employing abc tanks for assisting in the detection of chemical and biological weapons .
these could support u.s. soldiers , for example .
or , if u.s. warships pull out of the mediterranean into the persian gulf , german vessels could replace their positions .
but even providing u.s. troops with military bases in germany is also – legally speaking – participating in a war .
and germany would never refuse this service , no matter if the government sees the war on iraq as right or wrong .
no timetable has been set for military action , yet .
some members of u.s. congress , including conservative republicans , are beginning to urge president bush to explain his reasoning and goals before committing american forces to topple a foreign government that has not attacked the u.s. the same holds true for its european allies .

recently-released statistics paint a grim picture of the economic future of germany 's youth and have sent chancellor gerhard schröder rushing to remedy the situation before elections . the effects of germany 's economic slump have wound their way down to the country 's youth .
in what is seen as another damaging blow to chancellor gerhard schröder 's re-election hopes on september 22 , the federal labor office released statistics showing a major drop in the amount of apprenticeships available to secondary school graduates .
there are 10,000 fewer positions available compared to last year , according to the labor office .
employment offices have also registered a 6.4 percent drop in the amount of jobs they set up .
the numbers present the second statistical blow to germany 's youth in the past year .
in 2001 , the oecd-sponsored pisa education study ranked germany a disappointing 25 out of 32 countries .
the results were shocking for a country that had always taken pride in its superior educational system .
empty hope for german youth with thousands of german youngsters facing an uncertain future , schröder has weighed in , firing off a letter to german industry leaders reminding them of their duty to provide apprenticeship-opportunities for the country 's low-skilled youth .
" those that demand the immigration of highly-skilled workers , need to also be ready to do everything possible to offer the people here all possible apprenticeship and training opportunities , " he wrote to the association of german industry and chambers of commerce .
the chancellor was backed up in his argument by germany 's biggest unions , who reminded industry leaders that they had a duty to provide employment opportunities for germany 's youth .
training a vital step to secure future german teenagers typically apply for vocational training between the ages of 15 and 19 , following graduation from their secondary school . the training , which usually lasts a few years , is considered a vital step in securing a job in their field for the long-term .
schröder 's government has managed to keep the number of training positions fairly steady in the past two years .
drops in positions in craft-related-fields like carpentry were typically offset by yearly gains in the amount of positions available in the industrial and commercial sector .
but those numbers have fallen this year as well .
industry : youth not qualified enough industry leaders say pisa has reared its ugly head in applications for training positions .
the head of the industry association , ludwig georg braun , said the education level of many graduates is " poor . "
" many graduates ca n't fill complicated positions , " braun wrote in a reply to schröder 's open letter .
still , braun promised that industry would do more to create apprenticeships in the coming months .

it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .
local authorities on germany ’ s north sea coast are already bracing themselves for a large-scale epidemic .

weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .

it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .

analysts welcomed the move , saying it could only boost confidence in the group . volkswagen ag on tuesday revised down its full-year profit outlook – and was rewarded by the markets and applauded by analysts .
in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .
arndt ellinghorst , automobiles analyst at westlb , described the profit warning as " the right thing to do " .
he said it had boosted confidence in the group 's management .
" this is just what the market wanted to see " , said christian breitsprecher at deutsche bank .
volkswagen said it expected a pretax profit of " around 4 billion euro " for the full year , in a move that represents the abandonment of previous forecasts that it would match last year 's record 4.4 billion euro .
to soften the blow , the car maker unveiled first-half results that beat expectations .
the company said second-quarter pretax profits had risen 13.5 percent on the year to 1.266 billion euro .
this left its first-half result at 2.26 billion euro , down 4.4 percent on the year .
" the results are better than expected " , said georg stürzer at hvb group .
he said the wolfsburg-based autos giant had done particularly well to raise its returns in its operating business .
the 13.5 percent earnings growth seen in the second quarter had been won at a time when sales revenue had risen just 1 percent to 227 billion euro .
at the start of the year , the group had said it expected an economic recovery in the second half , but it said it had since become clear that this expectation would not be borne out .
" an improvement is highly unlikely " , said chief executive bernd pischetsrieder .
but he stressed that the new guidance was still conservative .
globally , car sales have fallen on all important markets , and this development has hit volkswagen hard .
it is also one of the european companies which has been most affected by the downturn in the key markets of latin america .

analysts welcomed the move , saying it could only boost confidence in the group . volkswagen ag on tuesday revised down its full-year profit outlook – and was rewarded by the markets and applauded by analysts .
in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .
arndt ellinghorst , automobiles analyst at westlb , described the profit warning as " the right thing to do " .
he said it had boosted confidence in the group 's management .
" this is just what the market wanted to see " , said christian breitsprecher at deutsche bank .
volkswagen said it expected a pretax profit of " around 4 billion euro " for the full year , in a move that represents the abandonment of previous forecasts that it would match last year 's record 4.4 billion euro .
to soften the blow , the car maker unveiled first-half results that beat expectations .
the company said second-quarter pretax profits had risen 13.5 percent on the year to 1.266 billion euro .
this left its first-half result at 2.26 billion euro , down 4.4 percent on the year .
" the results are better than expected " , said georg stürzer at hvb group .
he said the wolfsburg-based autos giant had done particularly well to raise its returns in its operating business .
the 13.5 percent earnings growth seen in the second quarter had been won at a time when sales revenue had risen just 1 percent to 227 billion euro .
at the start of the year , the group had said it expected an economic recovery in the second half , but it said it had since become clear that this expectation would not be borne out .
" an improvement is highly unlikely " , said chief executive bernd pischetsrieder .
but he stressed that the new guidance was still conservative .
globally , car sales have fallen on all important markets , and this development has hit volkswagen hard .
it is also one of the european companies which has been most affected by the downturn in the key markets of latin america .
its first-half unit sales on the brazilian market were down 17 percent on the year .
worse still has been the impact on truck maker scania , in which vw holds a sizeable share .
the swedish company 's first-half orders from latin america were down 58 percent on the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .
local authorities on germany ’ s north sea coast are already bracing themselves for a large-scale epidemic .
but given the lethality of the virus , local crisis management will most likely be reduced to one measure : the removal of carcasses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .

recently-released statistics paint a grim picture of the economic future of germany 's youth and have sent chancellor gerhard schröder rushing to remedy the situation before elections . the effects of germany 's economic slump have wound their way down to the country 's youth .
in what is seen as another damaging blow to chancellor gerhard schröder 's re-election hopes on september 22 , the federal labor office released statistics showing a major drop in the amount of apprenticeships available to secondary school graduates .
there are 10,000 fewer positions available compared to last year , according to the labor office .
employment offices have also registered a 6.4 percent drop in the amount of jobs they set up .
the numbers present the second statistical blow to germany 's youth in the past year .
in 2001 , the oecd-sponsored pisa education study ranked germany a disappointing 25 out of 32 countries .
the results were shocking for a country that had always taken pride in its superior educational system .
empty hope for german youth with thousands of german youngsters facing an uncertain future , schröder has weighed in , firing off a letter to german industry leaders reminding them of their duty to provide apprenticeship-opportunities for the country 's low-skilled youth .
" those that demand the immigration of highly-skilled workers , need to also be ready to do everything possible to offer the people here all possible apprenticeship and training opportunities , " he wrote to the association of german industry and chambers of commerce .
the chancellor was backed up in his argument by germany 's biggest unions , who reminded industry leaders that they had a duty to provide employment opportunities for germany 's youth .
training a vital step to secure future german teenagers typically apply for vocational training between the ages of 15 and 19 , following graduation from their secondary school . the training , which usually lasts a few years , is considered a vital step in securing a job in their field for the long-term .
schröder 's government has managed to keep the number of training positions fairly steady in the past two years .
drops in positions in craft-related-fields like carpentry were typically offset by yearly gains in the amount of positions available in the industrial and commercial sector .
but those numbers have fallen this year as well .
industry : youth not qualified enough industry leaders say pisa has reared its ugly head in applications for training positions .
the head of the industry association , ludwig georg braun , said the education level of many graduates is " poor . "
" many graduates ca n't fill complicated positions , " braun wrote in a reply to schröder 's open letter .
still , braun promised that industry would do more to create apprenticeships in the coming months .

at the franco-german summit , held in the eastern german city of schwerin , the two powerful european neighbors signed an agreement providing for the integration of the two national military satellite systems , germany 's sar-lupe and france 's helio ii .
they said other european states would be invited to join the collaboration . "
" common european solutions will contribute to the strengthening of the independent and capable industrial and technological defense foundation that europe needs , " the two governments said in the declaration that they issued at the close of what is the 79th of their twice-yearly summits .
the two countries ' support for the development of a european satellite platform independent of the u.s. platform is founded in their experiences during the balkan conflicts , when the supply of satellite pictures from the u.s. system proved unreliable .
germany and france said they also plan to move towards common european defense planning and arms procurement .
in this connection , both sides reaffirmed their support for the a400m military transport plane , to be built by european defense consortium eads .
armaments experts believe that the privatization plans of the french government will provide impetus in the country 's defense collaboration with germany .
in the past , according to german defense-industry insiders , the state influence over the country 's defense companies has worked against these companies ' involvement in mergers .
in consequence , german firms have had to look to other european union countries or to the u.s. for a merger partner .
in schwerin , a spokesman for president jacques chirac made it clear that the state plans to withdraw from the country 's armaments concerns .
so , for example , its 100 % stake in aerospace engine maker snecma sa will be put up for sale , as will its 15 % stake in thales , formerly known as thomson-csf , the paris-based defense and civil electronics group .

recently-released statistics paint a grim picture of the economic future of germany 's youth and have sent chancellor gerhard schröder rushing to remedy the situation before elections . the effects of germany 's economic slump have wound their way down to the country 's youth .
in what is seen as another damaging blow to chancellor gerhard schröder 's re-election hopes on september 22 , the federal labor office released statistics showing a major drop in the amount of apprenticeships available to secondary school graduates .
there are 10,000 fewer positions available compared to last year , according to the labor office .
employment offices have also registered a 6.4 percent drop in the amount of jobs they set up .
the numbers present the second statistical blow to germany 's youth in the past year .
in 2001 , the oecd-sponsored pisa education study ranked germany a disappointing 25 out of 32 countries .
the results were shocking for a country that had always taken pride in its superior educational system .
empty hope for german youth with thousands of german youngsters facing an uncertain future , schröder has weighed in , firing off a letter to german industry leaders reminding them of their duty to provide apprenticeship-opportunities for the country 's low-skilled youth .
" those that demand the immigration of highly-skilled workers , need to also be ready to do everything possible to offer the people here all possible apprenticeship and training opportunities , " he wrote to the association of german industry and chambers of commerce .
the chancellor was backed up in his argument by germany 's biggest unions , who reminded industry leaders that they had a duty to provide employment opportunities for germany 's youth .
training a vital step to secure future german teenagers typically apply for vocational training between the ages of 15 and 19 , following graduation from their secondary school . the training , which usually lasts a few years , is considered a vital step in securing a job in their field for the long-term .
schröder 's government has managed to keep the number of training positions fairly steady in the past two years .
drops in positions in craft-related-fields like carpentry were typically offset by yearly gains in the amount of positions available in the industrial and commercial sector .
but those numbers have fallen this year as well .
industry : youth not qualified enough industry leaders say pisa has reared its ugly head in applications for training positions .
the head of the industry association , ludwig georg braun , said the education level of many graduates is " poor . "
" many graduates ca n't fill complicated positions , " braun wrote in a reply to schröder 's open letter .
still , braun promised that industry would do more to create apprenticeships in the coming months .
" even in economically difficult times , " braun wrote .

in what is seen as another damaging blow to chancellor gerhard schröder 's re-election hopes on september 22 , the federal labor office released statistics showing a major drop in the amount of apprenticeships available to secondary school graduates .
there are 10,000 fewer positions available compared to last year , according to the labor office .
employment offices have also registered a 6.4 percent drop in the amount of jobs they set up .
the numbers present the second statistical blow to germany 's youth in the past year .
in 2001 , the oecd-sponsored pisa education study ranked germany a disappointing 25 out of 32 countries .
the results were shocking for a country that had always taken pride in its superior educational system .
empty hope for german youth with thousands of german youngsters facing an uncertain future , schröder has weighed in , firing off a letter to german industry leaders reminding them of their duty to provide apprenticeship-opportunities for the country 's low-skilled youth .
" those that demand the immigration of highly-skilled workers , need to also be ready to do everything possible to offer the people here all possible apprenticeship and training opportunities , " he wrote to the association of german industry and chambers of commerce .
the chancellor was backed up in his argument by germany 's biggest unions , who reminded industry leaders that they had a duty to provide employment opportunities for germany 's youth .
training a vital step to secure future german teenagers typically apply for vocational training between the ages of 15 and 19 , following graduation from their secondary school . the training , which usually lasts a few years , is considered a vital step in securing a job in their field for the long-term .
schröder 's government has managed to keep the number of training positions fairly steady in the past two years .
drops in positions in craft-related-fields like carpentry were typically offset by yearly gains in the amount of positions available in the industrial and commercial sector .
but those numbers have fallen this year as well .
industry : youth not qualified enough industry leaders say pisa has reared its ugly head in applications for training positions .
the head of the industry association , ludwig georg braun , said the education level of many graduates is " poor . "
" many graduates ca n't fill complicated positions , " braun wrote in a reply to schröder 's open letter .
still , braun promised that industry would do more to create apprenticeships in the coming months .
" even in economically difficult times , " braun wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 31.07.2002 germany still on the fence in possible iraq attack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can germany 's overstretched military forces afford another commitment in iraq ?
u.s. plans for an assault against iraq are becoming increasingly concrete .
britain has already stated its support for the action .
germany , though , says its military has its hands full .
but does it have a choice ? german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have repeatedly made it clear that berlin 's center-left coalition government will not participate in a u.s.-led attack on iraq .
but washington continues to put pressure on its european allies .
only britain has said it will support such a move .
from a military perspective , germany says its capabilities are exhausted .
peacekeeping troops are stationed in the balkans and germany is assisting operations in afghanistan , the latter marking the first deployment for combat operations outside of europe since 1945 .
although this may be the case , the nation 's political relevance in nato and as a u.s. ally can not be ignored .
in an interview with dw-world , dr. jochen hippler from the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg suggests that germany ultimately will be part of the war against iraq , even without combat troops .
what are the political implications of germany 's possible involvement in a u.s.-led attack on iraq ?
with federal elections approaching in september , the german government is interested in lying low .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer know that praising an adventure in iraq would not be beneficial for their election campaign .
on the other hand , the government does not want to make any public statements that could be picked up by the opposition as anti-american .
any sort of remarks against president bush could make the opposition candidate edmund stoiber look like the real transatlantic friend .
so it 's a fine line they 're walking with respect to domestic policy .
but does germany really have a choice , considering its powerful position in europe ?
foreign policy is another matter .
from this point of view , germany will take part , no matter how absurd the government finds an assault on iraq .
decisions on these types of military deployment are based on alliances .
they are a signal to germany 's western allies .
it also has significance for transatlantic relations , as it 's important to stay on the good side of the world 's most powerful nation .
you say it 's a fine line for germany to walk on in an election year .
what if we see a change in government in september , with a possible coalition of the conservative christian democrats cdu , their bavarian sister party csu and the free democrats fdp ?
will that have an impact on german involvement in iraq ?
i do n't think it will make such a difference in this case .
germany will participate in an assault against iraq , whether the cdu / fdp or the current government is in power .
but , in my opinion , it will certainly not involve active participation of german combat troops .
there are , though , many other ways germany could support the attack on iraq , too .
germany has stationed troops in kuwait , employing abc tanks for assisting in the detection of chemical and biological weapons .
these could support u.s. soldiers , for example .
or , if u.s. warships pull out of the mediterranean into the persian gulf , german vessels could replace their positions .
but even providing u.s. troops with military bases in germany is also – legally speaking – participating in a war .
and germany would never refuse this service , no matter if the government sees the war on iraq as right or wrong .
no timetable has been set for military action , yet .
some members of u.s. congress , including conservative republicans , are beginning to urge president bush to explain his reasoning and goals before committing american forces to topple a foreign government that has not attacked the u.s. the same holds true for its european allies .
how can the public be convinced that saddam hussein poses an intolerable threat to the u.s. and its allies ?
i do n't think there will be any action until next spring .
there certainly needs to be a better political pretense and diplomatic preparation is still necessary .
the argument that iraq is producing weapons of mass destruction is an absurd argument for a war .
i am certain that at some point some sort of connection will materialize showing saddam hussein as the " little brother " of osama bin laden .
such documents will , of course , not be made public .
and whether they are even true is a different matter .
but by the time that is clarified , five years will have passed and the war would be over by then , anyway .
such a development would make it easier for the german government to say : yes , we are going to be part of this .
a direct connection between saddam hussein and terrorism makes it easier to rally emotional support . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links institute for development and peace further information on the institute 's activities , publications and researchers .

analysts welcomed the move , saying it could only boost confidence in the group . volkswagen ag on tuesday revised down its full-year profit outlook – and was rewarded by the markets and applauded by analysts .
in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .
arndt ellinghorst , automobiles analyst at westlb , described the profit warning as " the right thing to do " .
he said it had boosted confidence in the group 's management .
" this is just what the market wanted to see " , said christian breitsprecher at deutsche bank .
volkswagen said it expected a pretax profit of " around 4 billion euro " for the full year , in a move that represents the abandonment of previous forecasts that it would match last year 's record 4.4 billion euro .
to soften the blow , the car maker unveiled first-half results that beat expectations .
the company said second-quarter pretax profits had risen 13.5 percent on the year to 1.266 billion euro .
this left its first-half result at 2.26 billion euro , down 4.4 percent on the year .
" the results are better than expected " , said georg stürzer at hvb group .
he said the wolfsburg-based autos giant had done particularly well to raise its returns in its operating business .
the 13.5 percent earnings growth seen in the second quarter had been won at a time when sales revenue had risen just 1 percent to 227 billion euro .
at the start of the year , the group had said it expected an economic recovery in the second half , but it said it had since become clear that this expectation would not be borne out .
" an improvement is highly unlikely " , said chief executive bernd pischetsrieder .
but he stressed that the new guidance was still conservative .
globally , car sales have fallen on all important markets , and this development has hit volkswagen hard .
it is also one of the european companies which has been most affected by the downturn in the key markets of latin america .
its first-half unit sales on the brazilian market were down 17 percent on the year .
worse still has been the impact on truck maker scania , in which vw holds a sizeable share .
the swedish company 's first-half orders from latin america were down 58 percent on the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

analysts welcomed the move , saying it could only boost confidence in the group . volkswagen ag on tuesday revised down its full-year profit outlook – and was rewarded by the markets and applauded by analysts .
in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .
arndt ellinghorst , automobiles analyst at westlb , described the profit warning as " the right thing to do " .
he said it had boosted confidence in the group 's management .
" this is just what the market wanted to see " , said christian breitsprecher at deutsche bank .
volkswagen said it expected a pretax profit of " around 4 billion euro " for the full year , in a move that represents the abandonment of previous forecasts that it would match last year 's record 4.4 billion euro .
to soften the blow , the car maker unveiled first-half results that beat expectations .
the company said second-quarter pretax profits had risen 13.5 percent on the year to 1.266 billion euro .
this left its first-half result at 2.26 billion euro , down 4.4 percent on the year .
" the results are better than expected " , said georg stürzer at hvb group .
he said the wolfsburg-based autos giant had done particularly well to raise its returns in its operating business .
the 13.5 percent earnings growth seen in the second quarter had been won at a time when sales revenue had risen just 1 percent to 227 billion euro .
at the start of the year , the group had said it expected an economic recovery in the second half , but it said it had since become clear that this expectation would not be borne out .
" an improvement is highly unlikely " , said chief executive bernd pischetsrieder .
but he stressed that the new guidance was still conservative .
globally , car sales have fallen on all important markets , and this development has hit volkswagen hard .
it is also one of the european companies which has been most affected by the downturn in the key markets of latin america .
its first-half unit sales on the brazilian market were down 17 percent on the year .

in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .
arndt ellinghorst , automobiles analyst at westlb , described the profit warning as " the right thing to do " .
he said it had boosted confidence in the group 's management .
" this is just what the market wanted to see " , said christian breitsprecher at deutsche bank .
volkswagen said it expected a pretax profit of " around 4 billion euro " for the full year , in a move that represents the abandonment of previous forecasts that it would match last year 's record 4.4 billion euro .
to soften the blow , the car maker unveiled first-half results that beat expectations .
the company said second-quarter pretax profits had risen 13.5 percent on the year to 1.266 billion euro .
this left its first-half result at 2.26 billion euro , down 4.4 percent on the year .
" the results are better than expected " , said georg stürzer at hvb group .
he said the wolfsburg-based autos giant had done particularly well to raise its returns in its operating business .
the 13.5 percent earnings growth seen in the second quarter had been won at a time when sales revenue had risen just 1 percent to 227 billion euro .
at the start of the year , the group had said it expected an economic recovery in the second half , but it said it had since become clear that this expectation would not be borne out .

recently-released statistics paint a grim picture of the economic future of germany 's youth and have sent chancellor gerhard schröder rushing to remedy the situation before elections . the effects of germany 's economic slump have wound their way down to the country 's youth .
in what is seen as another damaging blow to chancellor gerhard schröder 's re-election hopes on september 22 , the federal labor office released statistics showing a major drop in the amount of apprenticeships available to secondary school graduates .
there are 10,000 fewer positions available compared to last year , according to the labor office .
employment offices have also registered a 6.4 percent drop in the amount of jobs they set up .
the numbers present the second statistical blow to germany 's youth in the past year .
in 2001 , the oecd-sponsored pisa education study ranked germany a disappointing 25 out of 32 countries .
the results were shocking for a country that had always taken pride in its superior educational system .
empty hope for german youth with thousands of german youngsters facing an uncertain future , schröder has weighed in , firing off a letter to german industry leaders reminding them of their duty to provide apprenticeship-opportunities for the country 's low-skilled youth .
" those that demand the immigration of highly-skilled workers , need to also be ready to do everything possible to offer the people here all possible apprenticeship and training opportunities , " he wrote to the association of german industry and chambers of commerce .
the chancellor was backed up in his argument by germany 's biggest unions , who reminded industry leaders that they had a duty to provide employment opportunities for germany 's youth .
training a vital step to secure future german teenagers typically apply for vocational training between the ages of 15 and 19 , following graduation from their secondary school . the training , which usually lasts a few years , is considered a vital step in securing a job in their field for the long-term .
schröder 's government has managed to keep the number of training positions fairly steady in the past two years .
drops in positions in craft-related-fields like carpentry were typically offset by yearly gains in the amount of positions available in the industrial and commercial sector .
but those numbers have fallen this year as well .
industry : youth not qualified enough industry leaders say pisa has reared its ugly head in applications for training positions .
the head of the industry association , ludwig georg braun , said the education level of many graduates is " poor . "
" many graduates ca n't fill complicated positions , " braun wrote in a reply to schröder 's open letter .
still , braun promised that industry would do more to create apprenticeships in the coming months .
" even in economically difficult times , " braun wrote .
" we need to keep the future of our youth in view . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 31.07.2002 germany still on the fence in possible iraq attack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can germany 's overstretched military forces afford another commitment in iraq ?
u.s. plans for an assault against iraq are becoming increasingly concrete .
britain has already stated its support for the action .
germany , though , says its military has its hands full .
but does it have a choice ? german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have repeatedly made it clear that berlin 's center-left coalition government will not participate in a u.s.-led attack on iraq .
but washington continues to put pressure on its european allies .
only britain has said it will support such a move .
from a military perspective , germany says its capabilities are exhausted .
peacekeeping troops are stationed in the balkans and germany is assisting operations in afghanistan , the latter marking the first deployment for combat operations outside of europe since 1945 .
although this may be the case , the nation 's political relevance in nato and as a u.s. ally can not be ignored .
in an interview with dw-world , dr. jochen hippler from the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg suggests that germany ultimately will be part of the war against iraq , even without combat troops .
what are the political implications of germany 's possible involvement in a u.s.-led attack on iraq ?
with federal elections approaching in september , the german government is interested in lying low .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer know that praising an adventure in iraq would not be beneficial for their election campaign .
on the other hand , the government does not want to make any public statements that could be picked up by the opposition as anti-american .
any sort of remarks against president bush could make the opposition candidate edmund stoiber look like the real transatlantic friend .
so it 's a fine line they 're walking with respect to domestic policy .
but does germany really have a choice , considering its powerful position in europe ?
foreign policy is another matter .
from this point of view , germany will take part , no matter how absurd the government finds an assault on iraq .
decisions on these types of military deployment are based on alliances .
they are a signal to germany 's western allies .
it also has significance for transatlantic relations , as it 's important to stay on the good side of the world 's most powerful nation .
you say it 's a fine line for germany to walk on in an election year .
what if we see a change in government in september , with a possible coalition of the conservative christian democrats cdu , their bavarian sister party csu and the free democrats fdp ?
will that have an impact on german involvement in iraq ?
i do n't think it will make such a difference in this case .
germany will participate in an assault against iraq , whether the cdu / fdp or the current government is in power .
but , in my opinion , it will certainly not involve active participation of german combat troops .
there are , though , many other ways germany could support the attack on iraq , too .
germany has stationed troops in kuwait , employing abc tanks for assisting in the detection of chemical and biological weapons .
these could support u.s. soldiers , for example .
or , if u.s. warships pull out of the mediterranean into the persian gulf , german vessels could replace their positions .
but even providing u.s. troops with military bases in germany is also – legally speaking – participating in a war .
and germany would never refuse this service , no matter if the government sees the war on iraq as right or wrong .
no timetable has been set for military action , yet .
some members of u.s. congress , including conservative republicans , are beginning to urge president bush to explain his reasoning and goals before committing american forces to topple a foreign government that has not attacked the u.s. the same holds true for its european allies .
how can the public be convinced that saddam hussein poses an intolerable threat to the u.s. and its allies ?
i do n't think there will be any action until next spring .
there certainly needs to be a better political pretense and diplomatic preparation is still necessary .
the argument that iraq is producing weapons of mass destruction is an absurd argument for a war .
i am certain that at some point some sort of connection will materialize showing saddam hussein as the " little brother " of osama bin laden .
such documents will , of course , not be made public .
and whether they are even true is a different matter .
but by the time that is clarified , five years will have passed and the war would be over by then , anyway .
such a development would make it easier for the german government to say : yes , we are going to be part of this .
a direct connection between saddam hussein and terrorism makes it easier to rally emotional support . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links institute for development and peace further information on the institute 's activities , publications and researchers .

it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .
local authorities on germany ’ s north sea coast are already bracing themselves for a large-scale epidemic .
but given the lethality of the virus , local crisis management will most likely be reduced to one measure : the removal of carcasses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 31.07.2002 germany still on the fence in possible iraq attack großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can germany 's overstretched military forces afford another commitment in iraq ?
u.s. plans for an assault against iraq are becoming increasingly concrete .
britain has already stated its support for the action .
germany , though , says its military has its hands full .
but does it have a choice ? german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have repeatedly made it clear that berlin 's center-left coalition government will not participate in a u.s.-led attack on iraq .
but washington continues to put pressure on its european allies .
only britain has said it will support such a move .
from a military perspective , germany says its capabilities are exhausted .
peacekeeping troops are stationed in the balkans and germany is assisting operations in afghanistan , the latter marking the first deployment for combat operations outside of europe since 1945 .
although this may be the case , the nation 's political relevance in nato and as a u.s. ally can not be ignored .
in an interview with dw-world , dr. jochen hippler from the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg suggests that germany ultimately will be part of the war against iraq , even without combat troops .
what are the political implications of germany 's possible involvement in a u.s.-led attack on iraq ?
with federal elections approaching in september , the german government is interested in lying low .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer know that praising an adventure in iraq would not be beneficial for their election campaign .
on the other hand , the government does not want to make any public statements that could be picked up by the opposition as anti-american .
any sort of remarks against president bush could make the opposition candidate edmund stoiber look like the real transatlantic friend .
so it 's a fine line they 're walking with respect to domestic policy .
but does germany really have a choice , considering its powerful position in europe ?
foreign policy is another matter .
from this point of view , germany will take part , no matter how absurd the government finds an assault on iraq .
decisions on these types of military deployment are based on alliances .
they are a signal to germany 's western allies .
it also has significance for transatlantic relations , as it 's important to stay on the good side of the world 's most powerful nation .
you say it 's a fine line for germany to walk on in an election year .
what if we see a change in government in september , with a possible coalition of the conservative christian democrats cdu , their bavarian sister party csu and the free democrats fdp ?
will that have an impact on german involvement in iraq ?
i do n't think it will make such a difference in this case .
germany will participate in an assault against iraq , whether the cdu / fdp or the current government is in power .
but , in my opinion , it will certainly not involve active participation of german combat troops .
there are , though , many other ways germany could support the attack on iraq , too .
germany has stationed troops in kuwait , employing abc tanks for assisting in the detection of chemical and biological weapons .
these could support u.s. soldiers , for example .
or , if u.s. warships pull out of the mediterranean into the persian gulf , german vessels could replace their positions .
but even providing u.s. troops with military bases in germany is also – legally speaking – participating in a war .
and germany would never refuse this service , no matter if the government sees the war on iraq as right or wrong .
no timetable has been set for military action , yet .
some members of u.s. congress , including conservative republicans , are beginning to urge president bush to explain his reasoning and goals before committing american forces to topple a foreign government that has not attacked the u.s. the same holds true for its european allies .
how can the public be convinced that saddam hussein poses an intolerable threat to the u.s. and its allies ?
i do n't think there will be any action until next spring .
there certainly needs to be a better political pretense and diplomatic preparation is still necessary .
the argument that iraq is producing weapons of mass destruction is an absurd argument for a war .
i am certain that at some point some sort of connection will materialize showing saddam hussein as the " little brother " of osama bin laden .
such documents will , of course , not be made public .
and whether they are even true is a different matter .
but by the time that is clarified , five years will have passed and the war would be over by then , anyway .
such a development would make it easier for the german government to say : yes , we are going to be part of this .
a direct connection between saddam hussein and terrorism makes it easier to rally emotional support . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links institute for development and peace further information on the institute 's activities , publications and researchers .

it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .
local authorities on germany ’ s north sea coast are already bracing themselves for a large-scale epidemic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 31.07.2002 germany 's youth face grim future after graduation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no apprenticeship , no future ?
recently-released statistics paint a grim picture of the economic future of germany 's youth and have sent chancellor gerhard schröder rushing to remedy the situation before elections . the effects of germany 's economic slump have wound their way down to the country 's youth .
in what is seen as another damaging blow to chancellor gerhard schröder 's re-election hopes on september 22 , the federal labor office released statistics showing a major drop in the amount of apprenticeships available to secondary school graduates .
there are 10,000 fewer positions available compared to last year , according to the labor office .
employment offices have also registered a 6.4 percent drop in the amount of jobs they set up .
the numbers present the second statistical blow to germany 's youth in the past year .
in 2001 , the oecd-sponsored pisa education study ranked germany a disappointing 25 out of 32 countries .
the results were shocking for a country that had always taken pride in its superior educational system .
empty hope for german youth with thousands of german youngsters facing an uncertain future , schröder has weighed in , firing off a letter to german industry leaders reminding them of their duty to provide apprenticeship-opportunities for the country 's low-skilled youth .
" those that demand the immigration of highly-skilled workers , need to also be ready to do everything possible to offer the people here all possible apprenticeship and training opportunities , " he wrote to the association of german industry and chambers of commerce .
the chancellor was backed up in his argument by germany 's biggest unions , who reminded industry leaders that they had a duty to provide employment opportunities for germany 's youth .
training a vital step to secure future german teenagers typically apply for vocational training between the ages of 15 and 19 , following graduation from their secondary school . the training , which usually lasts a few years , is considered a vital step in securing a job in their field for the long-term .
schröder 's government has managed to keep the number of training positions fairly steady in the past two years .
drops in positions in craft-related-fields like carpentry were typically offset by yearly gains in the amount of positions available in the industrial and commercial sector .
but those numbers have fallen this year as well .

recently-released statistics paint a grim picture of the economic future of germany 's youth and have sent chancellor gerhard schröder rushing to remedy the situation before elections . the effects of germany 's economic slump have wound their way down to the country 's youth .
in what is seen as another damaging blow to chancellor gerhard schröder 's re-election hopes on september 22 , the federal labor office released statistics showing a major drop in the amount of apprenticeships available to secondary school graduates .
there are 10,000 fewer positions available compared to last year , according to the labor office .
employment offices have also registered a 6.4 percent drop in the amount of jobs they set up .
the numbers present the second statistical blow to germany 's youth in the past year .
in 2001 , the oecd-sponsored pisa education study ranked germany a disappointing 25 out of 32 countries .
the results were shocking for a country that had always taken pride in its superior educational system .
empty hope for german youth with thousands of german youngsters facing an uncertain future , schröder has weighed in , firing off a letter to german industry leaders reminding them of their duty to provide apprenticeship-opportunities for the country 's low-skilled youth .
" those that demand the immigration of highly-skilled workers , need to also be ready to do everything possible to offer the people here all possible apprenticeship and training opportunities , " he wrote to the association of german industry and chambers of commerce .
the chancellor was backed up in his argument by germany 's biggest unions , who reminded industry leaders that they had a duty to provide employment opportunities for germany 's youth .
training a vital step to secure future german teenagers typically apply for vocational training between the ages of 15 and 19 , following graduation from their secondary school . the training , which usually lasts a few years , is considered a vital step in securing a job in their field for the long-term .
schröder 's government has managed to keep the number of training positions fairly steady in the past two years .
drops in positions in craft-related-fields like carpentry were typically offset by yearly gains in the amount of positions available in the industrial and commercial sector .
but those numbers have fallen this year as well .

analysts welcomed the move , saying it could only boost confidence in the group . volkswagen ag on tuesday revised down its full-year profit outlook – and was rewarded by the markets and applauded by analysts .
in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .
arndt ellinghorst , automobiles analyst at westlb , described the profit warning as " the right thing to do " .
he said it had boosted confidence in the group 's management .
" this is just what the market wanted to see " , said christian breitsprecher at deutsche bank .
volkswagen said it expected a pretax profit of " around 4 billion euro " for the full year , in a move that represents the abandonment of previous forecasts that it would match last year 's record 4.4 billion euro .
to soften the blow , the car maker unveiled first-half results that beat expectations .
the company said second-quarter pretax profits had risen 13.5 percent on the year to 1.266 billion euro .
this left its first-half result at 2.26 billion euro , down 4.4 percent on the year .
" the results are better than expected " , said georg stürzer at hvb group .
he said the wolfsburg-based autos giant had done particularly well to raise its returns in its operating business .
the 13.5 percent earnings growth seen in the second quarter had been won at a time when sales revenue had risen just 1 percent to 227 billion euro .
at the start of the year , the group had said it expected an economic recovery in the second half , but it said it had since become clear that this expectation would not be borne out .
" an improvement is highly unlikely " , said chief executive bernd pischetsrieder .
but he stressed that the new guidance was still conservative .
globally , car sales have fallen on all important markets , and this development has hit volkswagen hard .
it is also one of the european companies which has been most affected by the downturn in the key markets of latin america .
its first-half unit sales on the brazilian market were down 17 percent on the year .

it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .
local authorities on germany ’ s north sea coast are already bracing themselves for a large-scale epidemic .
but given the lethality of the virus , local crisis management will most likely be reduced to one measure : the removal of carcasses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .
local authorities on germany ’ s north sea coast are already bracing themselves for a large-scale epidemic .
but given the lethality of the virus , local crisis management will most likely be reduced to one measure : the removal of carcasses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

recently-released statistics paint a grim picture of the economic future of germany 's youth and have sent chancellor gerhard schröder rushing to remedy the situation before elections . the effects of germany 's economic slump have wound their way down to the country 's youth .
in what is seen as another damaging blow to chancellor gerhard schröder 's re-election hopes on september 22 , the federal labor office released statistics showing a major drop in the amount of apprenticeships available to secondary school graduates .
there are 10,000 fewer positions available compared to last year , according to the labor office .
employment offices have also registered a 6.4 percent drop in the amount of jobs they set up .
the numbers present the second statistical blow to germany 's youth in the past year .
in 2001 , the oecd-sponsored pisa education study ranked germany a disappointing 25 out of 32 countries .
the results were shocking for a country that had always taken pride in its superior educational system .
empty hope for german youth with thousands of german youngsters facing an uncertain future , schröder has weighed in , firing off a letter to german industry leaders reminding them of their duty to provide apprenticeship-opportunities for the country 's low-skilled youth .
" those that demand the immigration of highly-skilled workers , need to also be ready to do everything possible to offer the people here all possible apprenticeship and training opportunities , " he wrote to the association of german industry and chambers of commerce .
the chancellor was backed up in his argument by germany 's biggest unions , who reminded industry leaders that they had a duty to provide employment opportunities for germany 's youth .
training a vital step to secure future german teenagers typically apply for vocational training between the ages of 15 and 19 , following graduation from their secondary school . the training , which usually lasts a few years , is considered a vital step in securing a job in their field for the long-term .
schröder 's government has managed to keep the number of training positions fairly steady in the past two years .
drops in positions in craft-related-fields like carpentry were typically offset by yearly gains in the amount of positions available in the industrial and commercial sector .
but those numbers have fallen this year as well .
industry : youth not qualified enough industry leaders say pisa has reared its ugly head in applications for training positions .
the head of the industry association , ludwig georg braun , said the education level of many graduates is " poor . "
" many graduates ca n't fill complicated positions , " braun wrote in a reply to schröder 's open letter .
still , braun promised that industry would do more to create apprenticeships in the coming months .

recently-released statistics paint a grim picture of the economic future of germany 's youth and have sent chancellor gerhard schröder rushing to remedy the situation before elections . the effects of germany 's economic slump have wound their way down to the country 's youth .
in what is seen as another damaging blow to chancellor gerhard schröder 's re-election hopes on september 22 , the federal labor office released statistics showing a major drop in the amount of apprenticeships available to secondary school graduates .
there are 10,000 fewer positions available compared to last year , according to the labor office .
employment offices have also registered a 6.4 percent drop in the amount of jobs they set up .
the numbers present the second statistical blow to germany 's youth in the past year .
in 2001 , the oecd-sponsored pisa education study ranked germany a disappointing 25 out of 32 countries .
the results were shocking for a country that had always taken pride in its superior educational system .
empty hope for german youth with thousands of german youngsters facing an uncertain future , schröder has weighed in , firing off a letter to german industry leaders reminding them of their duty to provide apprenticeship-opportunities for the country 's low-skilled youth .
" those that demand the immigration of highly-skilled workers , need to also be ready to do everything possible to offer the people here all possible apprenticeship and training opportunities , " he wrote to the association of german industry and chambers of commerce .
the chancellor was backed up in his argument by germany 's biggest unions , who reminded industry leaders that they had a duty to provide employment opportunities for germany 's youth .
training a vital step to secure future german teenagers typically apply for vocational training between the ages of 15 and 19 , following graduation from their secondary school . the training , which usually lasts a few years , is considered a vital step in securing a job in their field for the long-term .
schröder 's government has managed to keep the number of training positions fairly steady in the past two years .
drops in positions in craft-related-fields like carpentry were typically offset by yearly gains in the amount of positions available in the industrial and commercial sector .
but those numbers have fallen this year as well .
industry : youth not qualified enough industry leaders say pisa has reared its ugly head in applications for training positions .
the head of the industry association , ludwig georg braun , said the education level of many graduates is " poor . "
" many graduates ca n't fill complicated positions , " braun wrote in a reply to schröder 's open letter .
still , braun promised that industry would do more to create apprenticeships in the coming months .
" even in economically difficult times , " braun wrote .

analysts welcomed the move , saying it could only boost confidence in the group . volkswagen ag on tuesday revised down its full-year profit outlook – and was rewarded by the markets and applauded by analysts .
in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .
arndt ellinghorst , automobiles analyst at westlb , described the profit warning as " the right thing to do " .
he said it had boosted confidence in the group 's management .
" this is just what the market wanted to see " , said christian breitsprecher at deutsche bank .
volkswagen said it expected a pretax profit of " around 4 billion euro " for the full year , in a move that represents the abandonment of previous forecasts that it would match last year 's record 4.4 billion euro .
to soften the blow , the car maker unveiled first-half results that beat expectations .
the company said second-quarter pretax profits had risen 13.5 percent on the year to 1.266 billion euro .
this left its first-half result at 2.26 billion euro , down 4.4 percent on the year .
" the results are better than expected " , said georg stürzer at hvb group .
he said the wolfsburg-based autos giant had done particularly well to raise its returns in its operating business .
the 13.5 percent earnings growth seen in the second quarter had been won at a time when sales revenue had risen just 1 percent to 227 billion euro .
at the start of the year , the group had said it expected an economic recovery in the second half , but it said it had since become clear that this expectation would not be borne out .
" an improvement is highly unlikely " , said chief executive bernd pischetsrieder .
but he stressed that the new guidance was still conservative .
globally , car sales have fallen on all important markets , and this development has hit volkswagen hard .
it is also one of the european companies which has been most affected by the downturn in the key markets of latin america .
its first-half unit sales on the brazilian market were down 17 percent on the year .
worse still has been the impact on truck maker scania , in which vw holds a sizeable share .
the swedish company 's first-half orders from latin america were down 58 percent on the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com © economy .

analysts welcomed the move , saying it could only boost confidence in the group . volkswagen ag on tuesday revised down its full-year profit outlook – and was rewarded by the markets and applauded by analysts .
in frankfurt , shares in europe 's biggest car maker closed up 5.15 percent at 46.95 euro in a slightly friendly market where several other blue chips lost ground .
arndt ellinghorst , automobiles analyst at westlb , described the profit warning as " the right thing to do " .
he said it had boosted confidence in the group 's management .
" this is just what the market wanted to see " , said christian breitsprecher at deutsche bank .
volkswagen said it expected a pretax profit of " around 4 billion euro " for the full year , in a move that represents the abandonment of previous forecasts that it would match last year 's record 4.4 billion euro .
to soften the blow , the car maker unveiled first-half results that beat expectations .
the company said second-quarter pretax profits had risen 13.5 percent on the year to 1.266 billion euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.07.2002 germany 's north sea seals fatally endangered again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the north sea seal population is in serious danger a virus , which cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany 's north sea coast in 1988 has turned up on german shores again this week .
it poses a fatal threat to the seals and ecology of europe ’ s unique north sea mud flats . the seal is a sociable animal .
but the creature 's friendly habits are now costing it its life .
experts say that viruses have little trouble spreading fast among seal populations .
indeed , in 1988 , the phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- cost the lives of 18,000 seals on germany ’ s north sea cost , effectively wiping out some 60 per cent of the area ’ s seal population .
repetition of a nightmare there are now fresh signs that the environmental nightmare is seeing an unwelcome revival .
the first dead seals with the lethal virus were discovered two months ago in kattegat , just off the danish island anholt .
since then 2000 animals have fallen victim to the deadly disease off the scandinavian coast , and the first five infected seals were washed up on german shores this week .
slow and painful death the present crisis is almost a repitition of the virus-outbreak scenario , 14 years ago .
the 1988 epidemic , the first to have been reported since researchers counted some 37,000 seals living in the north sea ’ s mud flats back in 1900 , was sparked by arctic seals . they are believed to have been suffering from russian and scandinavian overfishing and looking for nutrition way beyond the boundaries of their natural habitat .
the pdv virus befalls lungs and respiratory organs and bacterial infections bacteria follow .
as parasites spread easily to other body organs , the seal dies a slow , and painful death .
while arctic seals are able to live with the pdv virus , the north sea seal ’ s population are defenceless against this relatively new epidemic , as they lack the necesary antibodies .
in addition , weakened by a steady increase in marine pollution , these animals now stand little chance of survival .
weakened by pollution the origins of pdv and the reasons why it has befallen anholt for a second time are a mystery .
animal lovers and activists are becoming increasingly divided over the virus .
some say it is natural selection - the fishing industry estimates the size of the seal population has grown up to more than 20,000 animals .
others say it may have been brought in by a single animal from waters further afield - similar to the source of the virus back in 1998 .
but what scientists have found , however , is a close link between the virus , and high levels of pollution .
recent thyroid examinations on dead north sea seals show severe thyroid damage , coinciding with reports of seals from areas off the north german coast containing 17 times the amount of immune system damaging pcbs than their counterparts in iceland .
according to seal expert günter heidemann from kiel , " the virus alone was not responsible for the seal epidemic in 1988 " .
" it was also the immunodeficiency , resulting from high pollution levels " , he told the german weekly frankfurter allgemeine am sonntag .
no remedies earlier this week , jürgen trittin , germany ’ s environment minister , said he reckoned with an expansion of the virus in north sea waters .
a serum , which sparked fresh hopes of treatment in scandinavia , has proved little help against the contagious disease : reaching 20 000 seals in open waters with a serum which can only be injected into the animal ’ s muscle tissue is a tough task .
local authorities on germany ’ s north sea coast are already bracing themselves for a large-scale epidemic .
but given the lethality of the virus , local crisis management will most likely be reduced to one measure : the removal of carcasses . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

at the franco-german summit , held in the eastern german city of schwerin , the two powerful european neighbors signed an agreement providing for the integration of the two national military satellite systems , germany 's sar-lupe and france 's helio ii .
they said other european states would be invited to join the collaboration . "
" common european solutions will contribute to the strengthening of the independent and capable industrial and technological defense foundation that europe needs , " the two governments said in the declaration that they issued at the close of what is the 79th of their twice-yearly summits .
the two countries ' support for the development of a european satellite platform independent of the u.s. platform is founded in their experiences during the balkan conflicts , when the supply of satellite pictures from the u.s. system proved unreliable .
germany and france said they also plan to move towards common european defense planning and arms procurement .
in this connection , both sides reaffirmed their support for the a400m military transport plane , to be built by european defense consortium eads .
armaments experts believe that the privatization plans of the french government will provide impetus in the country 's defense collaboration with germany .
in the past , according to german defense-industry insiders , the state influence over the country 's defense companies has worked against these companies ' involvement in mergers .
in consequence , german firms have had to look to other european union countries or to the u.s. for a merger partner .
in schwerin , a spokesman for president jacques chirac made it clear that the state plans to withdraw from the country 's armaments concerns .
so , for example , its 100 % stake in aerospace engine maker snecma sa will be put up for sale , as will its 15 % stake in thales , formerly known as thomson-csf , the paris-based defense and civil electronics group .
one interest that the state wo n't put up for sale is its stake in giat , the tanks maker .

u.s. plans for an assault against iraq are becoming increasingly concrete .
britain has already stated its support for the action .
germany , though , says its military has its hands full .
but does it have a choice ? german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have repeatedly made it clear that berlin 's center-left coalition government will not participate in a u.s.-led attack on iraq .
but washington continues to put pressure on its european allies .
only britain has said it will support such a move .
from a military perspective , germany says its capabilities are exhausted .
peacekeeping troops are stationed in the balkans and germany is assisting operations in afghanistan , the latter marking the first deployment for combat operations outside of europe since 1945 .
although this may be the case , the nation 's political relevance in nato and as a u.s. ally can not be ignored .
in an interview with dw-world , dr. jochen hippler from the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg suggests that germany ultimately will be part of the war against iraq , even without combat troops .
what are the political implications of germany 's possible involvement in a u.s.-led attack on iraq ?
with federal elections approaching in september , the german government is interested in lying low .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer know that praising an adventure in iraq would not be beneficial for their election campaign .
on the other hand , the government does not want to make any public statements that could be picked up by the opposition as anti-american .
any sort of remarks against president bush could make the opposition candidate edmund stoiber look like the real transatlantic friend .
so it 's a fine line they 're walking with respect to domestic policy .
but does germany really have a choice , considering its powerful position in europe ?
foreign policy is another matter .
from this point of view , germany will take part , no matter how absurd the government finds an assault on iraq .
decisions on these types of military deployment are based on alliances .
they are a signal to germany 's western allies .
it also has significance for transatlantic relations , as it 's important to stay on the good side of the world 's most powerful nation .
you say it 's a fine line for germany to walk on in an election year .
what if we see a change in government in september , with a possible coalition of the conservative christian democrats cdu , their bavarian sister party csu and the free democrats fdp ?
will that have an impact on german involvement in iraq ?
i do n't think it will make such a difference in this case .
germany will participate in an assault against iraq , whether the cdu / fdp or the current government is in power .
but , in my opinion , it will certainly not involve active participation of german combat troops .
there are , though , many other ways germany could support the attack on iraq , too .
germany has stationed troops in kuwait , employing abc tanks for assisting in the detection of chemical and biological weapons .
these could support u.s. soldiers , for example .
or , if u.s. warships pull out of the mediterranean into the persian gulf , german vessels could replace their positions .
but even providing u.s. troops with military bases in germany is also – legally speaking – participating in a war .
and germany would never refuse this service , no matter if the government sees the war on iraq as right or wrong .
no timetable has been set for military action , yet .
some members of u.s. congress , including conservative republicans , are beginning to urge president bush to explain his reasoning and goals before committing american forces to topple a foreign government that has not attacked the u.s. the same holds true for its european allies .
how can the public be convinced that saddam hussein poses an intolerable threat to the u.s. and its allies ?
i do n't think there will be any action until next spring .
there certainly needs to be a better political pretense and diplomatic preparation is still necessary .
the argument that iraq is producing weapons of mass destruction is an absurd argument for a war .
i am certain that at some point some sort of connection will materialize showing saddam hussein as the " little brother " of osama bin laden .
such documents will , of course , not be made public .
and whether they are even true is a different matter .
but by the time that is clarified , five years will have passed and the war would be over by then , anyway .
such a development would make it easier for the german government to say : yes , we are going to be part of this .
a direct connection between saddam hussein and terrorism makes it easier to rally emotional support . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links institute for development and peace further information on the institute 's activities , publications and researchers .

u.s. plans for an assault against iraq are becoming increasingly concrete .
britain has already stated its support for the action .
germany , though , says its military has its hands full .
but does it have a choice ? german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have repeatedly made it clear that berlin 's center-left coalition government will not participate in a u.s.-led attack on iraq .
but washington continues to put pressure on its european allies .
only britain has said it will support such a move .
from a military perspective , germany says its capabilities are exhausted .
peacekeeping troops are stationed in the balkans and germany is assisting operations in afghanistan , the latter marking the first deployment for combat operations outside of europe since 1945 .
although this may be the case , the nation 's political relevance in nato and as a u.s. ally can not be ignored .
in an interview with dw-world , dr. jochen hippler from the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg suggests that germany ultimately will be part of the war against iraq , even without combat troops .
what are the political implications of germany 's possible involvement in a u.s.-led attack on iraq ?
with federal elections approaching in september , the german government is interested in lying low .
chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer know that praising an adventure in iraq would not be beneficial for their election campaign .
on the other hand , the government does not want to make any public statements that could be picked up by the opposition as anti-american .
any sort of remarks against president bush could make the opposition candidate edmund stoiber look like the real transatlantic friend .
so it 's a fine line they 're walking with respect to domestic policy .
but does germany really have a choice , considering its powerful position in europe ?
foreign policy is another matter .
from this point of view , germany will take part , no matter how absurd the government finds an assault on iraq .
decisions on these types of military deployment are based on alliances .
they are a signal to germany 's western allies .
it also has significance for transatlantic relations , as it 's important to stay on the good side of the world 's most powerful nation .
you say it 's a fine line for germany to walk on in an election year .
what if we see a change in government in september , with a possible coalition of the conservative christian democrats cdu , their bavarian sister party csu and the free democrats fdp ?
will that have an impact on german involvement in iraq ?
i do n't think it will make such a difference in this case .
germany will participate in an assault against iraq , whether the cdu / fdp or the current government is in power .
but , in my opinion , it will certainly not involve active participation of german combat troops .
there are , though , many other ways germany could support the attack on iraq , too .
germany has stationed troops in kuwait , employing abc tanks for assisting in the detection of chemical and biological weapons .
these could support u.s. soldiers , for example .
or , if u.s. warships pull out of the mediterranean into the persian gulf , german vessels could replace their positions .
but even providing u.s. troops with military bases in germany is also – legally speaking – participating in a war .
and germany would never refuse this service , no matter if the government sees the war on iraq as right or wrong .
no timetable has been set for military action , yet .
some members of u.s. congress , including conservative republicans , are beginning to urge president bush to explain his reasoning and goals before committing american forces to topple a foreign government that has not attacked the u.s. the same holds true for its european allies .
how can the public be convinced that saddam hussein poses an intolerable threat to the u.s. and its allies ?
i do n't think there will be any action until next spring .
there certainly needs to be a better political pretense and diplomatic preparation is still necessary .
the argument that iraq is producing weapons of mass destruction is an absurd argument for a war .
i am certain that at some point some sort of connection will materialize showing saddam hussein as the " little brother " of osama bin laden .
such documents will , of course , not be made public .

the securities and futures commission has been making enquiries after friday 's sharp fall in the low-priced shares , according to several anonymous brokers quoted by the south china morning post .
penny shares plunged after the hong kong stock exchange announced plans to delist penny stock which trades below 50 hong kong cents for 30 days in a row .
" we will check if anyone has been trying to take advantage of the situation to manipulate the shares , " according to a spokesman for the stock market watchdog quoted by the paper .
target stocks penny stocks make up 386 of the 791 companies listed on the stock market .
about 229 of these shares fell on friday , with about a tenth of them falling by more than 25 % .
" one single penny stock had turnover of more than 50 million dollars and the rest had a combined trading volume of about 40 million dollars , " the newspaper quoted a stock exchange source as saying .
" this showed there was a small amount of trading to manipulate a few penny stocks to create a panic . "
secret meeting the south china morning post described a meeting of brokers who on thursday night apparently agreed to start selling penny stocks in order to cause a panic sell-off by small investors .
the brokers had reportedly wanted to put a stop to a plan by the hong kong stock exchange to delist penny stocks that fall below 50 hong kong cents for 30 days in a row .
and if that had indeed been their intention , then it worked .
over the weekend , the exchange withdrew its plan and said they would reconsider it before presenting a new one in october .

it may be joined by the icebreaker that was sent to free it , but became stuck as well .
click here for a map of the area the argentine icebreaker almirante iriziar - which began to pull the german ship toward safer water earlier in july - will now attempt to force its way home alone .
captain eduardo benmuyal , said : " we are trying to identify a safe place to make our way north . "
the ships have supplies to last until november the icebreaker will use information from helicopters and satellites to plot the best route through the ice if it breaks through , he said .
the german ship , magdalena oldendorff , with a crew of 16 men and an argentine doctor and plenty of supplies , will not move until october .
the irizar and the magdalena oldendorff are about 940 miles -lrb- 1,500 kilometres -rrb- from open sea , according to the captain .
the german ship had left cape town on 12 april to supply the russian antarctic base of novolazarevskaya , some 3,000 km south of south africa , but became trapped in ice four metres thick on its return journey north .

last year , health minister jane hutt pledged £ 12m investment into the orthapedic part of the nhs in wales , and promised shorter waiting lists for those needing the bone and muscle treatment .
the move was designed to slash " completely unacceptable " waiting times of up to six years for surgery .
that deadline passed at 0000 bst , and means nobody in wales should now have been waiting for a year and a half for attention .
quarterly waiting list figures for wales are due to be published later in the day .
but it will still not be clear whether the welsh assembly 's self-imposed deadline has been met , because figures for july will not be available until next month , according to ms hutt .
last month , health authorities assured the minister her target would be met .

" i feel trapped because i ca n't walk down the road to get a bus to caerphilly , " she told bbc radio wales .
as eyes turn to the welsh assembly 's waiting list pledge , jane hutt is visiting an unique eye-screening programme to detect early signs of diabetic retinopathy , which can cause blindness in people with diabetes .
' retina photos ' she said the assembly government was launching the technique nationwide .
" the scheme i am launching will preserve people 's eyesight through a quality screening service covering all of wales , " she said .
the examination involves a photograph being taken of the back of the eye , the retina , with a digital camera .
susceptible patients should contact their gps for advice on making an appointment with the screening service .
this year , ms hutt has allocated £ 2m for the programme , which forms part of the wales eye care initiative .
