indeed , the worldwide economic decline that started two years ago was ushered in by climbing oil prices , said german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of european union leaders in copenhagen over the weekend . on monday , the price of oil was at $ 29 .
during the gulf war in 1990 , the oil price soared to more than $ 40 .
the next meeting of the organization of oil producing countries -lrb- opec -rrb- is on september 19 in osaka , japan . in addition to concern about oil shortages leading to higher prices , german experts also warned that the american conflict with iraq is also negatively affecting the public mood in germany . if germany were to enter the conflict , it ’ s reasonable to assume that taxes might need to be raised to finance the action , holger wenzel , head of the german retail association hde told die welt . fear about decline in retail sales with a sales tax increase of one percent , independent retailers in german would lose 9 billion euro , wenzel said .

besides sinking public confidence , which dampers consumer spending , hueck said german companies are holding off on making big investments . stock market slump is n't helping matters in the past , companies have financed their growth with earnings from the stock market – something that ’ s not possible as markets sink . across the atlantic , military conflicts have traditionally provided an economic boost as spending flows to the defense industry .
as a consequence of world war ii , germany has little in the way of a defense industry and thus can not count on this sort of ecnomic fallout from a possible war . indeed , deutsche bank economist norbert walter told the german news agency dpa : “ the peace dividends that we ’ ve been enjoying for the past decade since the end of the cold war are now a thing of the past . ” on the political front , the issue has taken center stage in the past days since chancellor gerhard schroder came out opposing german involvement in a possible u.s. attack on iraq . opposition candidate edmund stoiber stressed the need for continued good relations with the u.s. in the second and final television debate on sunday night .

indeed , the worldwide economic decline that started two years ago was ushered in by climbing oil prices , said german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of european union leaders in copenhagen over the weekend . on monday , the price of oil was at $ 29 .
during the gulf war in 1990 , the oil price soared to more than $ 40 .
the next meeting of the organization of oil producing countries -lrb- opec -rrb- is on september 19 in osaka , japan . in addition to concern about oil shortages leading to higher prices , german experts also warned that the american conflict with iraq is also negatively affecting the public mood in germany . if germany were to enter the conflict , it ’ s reasonable to assume that taxes might need to be raised to finance the action , holger wenzel , head of the german retail association hde told die welt . fear about decline in retail sales with a sales tax increase of one percent , independent retailers in german would lose 9 billion euro , wenzel said .

as a consequence of world war ii , germany has little in the way of a defense industry and thus can not count on this sort of ecnomic fallout from a possible war . indeed , deutsche bank economist norbert walter told the german news agency dpa : “ the peace dividends that we ’ ve been enjoying for the past decade since the end of the cold war are now a thing of the past . ” on the political front , the issue has taken center stage in the past days since chancellor gerhard schroder came out opposing german involvement in a possible u.s. attack on iraq . opposition candidate edmund stoiber stressed the need for continued good relations with the u.s. in the second and final television debate on sunday night .

indeed , the worldwide economic decline that started two years ago was ushered in by climbing oil prices , said german finance minister hans eichel at a meeting of european union leaders in copenhagen over the weekend . on monday , the price of oil was at $ 29 .
during the gulf war in 1990 , the oil price soared to more than $ 40 .
the next meeting of the organization of oil producing countries -lrb- opec -rrb- is on september 19 in osaka , japan . in addition to concern about oil shortages leading to higher prices , german experts also warned that the american conflict with iraq is also negatively affecting the public mood in germany . if germany were to enter the conflict , it ’ s reasonable to assume that taxes might need to be raised to finance the action , holger wenzel , head of the german retail association hde told die welt . fear about decline in retail sales with a sales tax increase of one percent , independent retailers in german would lose 9 billion euro , wenzel said .

besides sinking public confidence , which dampers consumer spending , hueck said german companies are holding off on making big investments . stock market slump is n't helping matters in the past , companies have financed their growth with earnings from the stock market – something that ’ s not possible as markets sink . across the atlantic , military conflicts have traditionally provided an economic boost as spending flows to the defense industry .
as a consequence of world war ii , germany has little in the way of a defense industry and thus can not count on this sort of ecnomic fallout from a possible war . indeed , deutsche bank economist norbert walter told the german news agency dpa : “ the peace dividends that we ’ ve been enjoying for the past decade since the end of the cold war are now a thing of the past . ” on the political front , the issue has taken center stage in the past days since chancellor gerhard schroder came out opposing german involvement in a possible u.s. attack on iraq . opposition candidate edmund stoiber stressed the need for continued good relations with the u.s. in the second and final television debate on sunday night .

in a lecture on the psychology of lying , polygraph machines were also criticised as being poor at detecting falsehoods .
the work was explained to the festival by psychologist dr richard wiseman , of the university of hertfordshire , an expert in the science of deception .
" people are really dreadful at detecting when someone is lying , " he told the bbc .
" they think that liars avoid eye contact and fidget a lot .
in fact , liars maintain more eye contact and they do n't fidget . "
lots of mistakes liars do this , dr wiseman says , to present a truthful demeanour .
" what you should do is look to see if there are long pauses between the questions you ask and the answers people give , " he said .
other indicators of lying include the use of short sentences , and any fluffs or errors in a person 's speech .
lack of movement can also be a clue to untruthfulness .
dr wiseman told the festival that the uk government should not rely on polygraph machines to determine if sex offenders are likely re-offend on release .
poor guide he said such machines were prone to throwing up false positives .
" they detect when someone is stressed , not necessarily when they are lying . "
dr wiseman is a regular at the festival and has an eye for research that catches popular interest .
last year , he used the event to launch research into what makes us all laugh .
he set about trying to find the world 's funniest joke .
he created a website through which people could submit their favourite gag and vote on others using a laughometer .

the terrible attacks of september 11 have united the american people as never before .
this is a country at war .
but some of those most directly affected have started to say : not in my name .
to have an airplane fly into your brother 's or your son 's building - changes the whole world rita lasar when she can face it , rita lasar comes to st paul 's church , right next to ground zero .
this is where tributes have been left for the victims of september 11 .
rita comes to remember her brother abe zalmanowitz .
she tells me : " there 's an ache in my heart that has n't gone away - it gets stronger when i come here - much stronger . "
abe was on the 27th floor of the world trade centre .
he could easily have escaped .
but he decided to stay with his friend ed who could n't make it down the stairs - he was in a wheelchair .
they died together as the first tower collapsed .
rita told me : " to have an airplane fly into your brother 's or your son 's building - changes the whole world . "
and rita 's world has changed completely in the last year .
september 11 started it - but almost as important for her is september 14 .
rita : not in my name on that day , president bush made a speech which singled out her brother 's heroism .
rita explains : " i said to myself ' oh of course they 're going to use my brother 's death and act to justify killing people in afghanistan ' .
and that horrified me almost as much as his dying . "
rita was so distressed by the thought of innocent afghans being killed , that she decided to go there .
in village after village she found homes destroyed , relatives distraught .
she tried to give a letter to the us embassy , but she was turned away .
since she 's come back rita has become a passionate critic of the war on terror .
she tells me : " americans want to believe that we 're the best , kindest freest most generous people in the world .
but all the aid and all the money that we provide is done in our self- interest .
" what are we accomplishing ? we 're just sowing the seeds of hatred for us and we 're good people . "
rita 's life has been turned upside down in the last year .
at the age of 70 , she 's become an activist .
she is still consumed by grief at the loss of her brother - but there is also a sense of foreboding for the future of her country .

researchers announced at the british association 's science festival in leicester that a diet that includes green lip mussels can relieve the swelling associated with the common joint disease .
the scientists came upon the medicinal powers of these sea creatures after it was noted that the maoris of new zealand ate them raw in large quantities and rarely suffered pain in the limbs .
in tests done at the waltham centre for pet care in leicestershire , arthritic dogs fed extracts from the mussels gained considerable benefit - with half of the animals in the study showing at least a 50 % improvement .
the extracts can be found in some health supplements for humans .
now , the estimated one million dogs in the uk suffering from osteoarthritis look set to be offered the same treatment as well .
useful drug " it is two years now since waltham scientists in the united states started to look for alternative therapies other than for instance aspirin which can actually cause damage to dogs long term , " dr karyl hurley from the centre told the bbc .
" these mussels have a strong anti-inflammatory action . "
osteoarthritis results when cartilage around the joints degenerates , resulting in lameness .
it means many dogs are confined to a sedentary life and a daily regime of pills .
but it is claimed that a diet including green lip mussels can change this .
scientists believe that the combination of fatty acids and anti-oxidants in the mussels can significantly reduce the symptoms of the disease .
however , it has taken several years to develop a usable drug .
the usual forms of processing that involve heat treatment were found to denature , or destroy , the useful proteins in the mussels .
dr hurley said : " now , there is a patented process that allows you to take the flesh of the mussel and freeze-dry it and stabilise it , so you can add it to a product .
and this is what we 've used for these pet foods . "

speaking in washington , he advised caution before attacking iraq .
general zinni also said he did not believe there should be any more middle east peace missions similar to those he undertook earlier this year .
his views are particularly interesting because he is known to be close to the secretary of state , colin powell .
general zinni demands a " clear and present danger " as justification for war ironically , if general zinni were still in his old job in charge of the us military 's central command , he would have been the general running any war with iraq .
the general said there were some people who believed a war with iraq might help the middle east peace process .
" i do n't know what planet they 're on , " he commented .
" such a war would make the situation between israel and the palestinians much worse . "
he warned that saddam hussein would do his best to draw israel into the war and he warned also of the danger of destabilising america 's allies in the region .
outspoken nevertheless , general zinni said he would support a war if there was what he described as a clear and present danger and if president george w bush won the support of the us congress and of the international community .
these were particularly outspoken comments from someone who is still officially working for the us government .
however , the general also seemed to be talking himself out of a job .
he said he believed there should not be any more middle east peace missions similar to those he undertook earlier this year .

the party 's national executive committee met in aberystwyth at the weekend , when officials concluded there was " no possible justification " for attacking saddam hussein without a united nations mandate .
a survey of labour mps in westminster last week found most felt they could not support military action without direct evidence that iraq posed a military threat to other countries .
now plaid cymru president ieuan wyn jones has warned of " massive casualties " from prolonged and " unjustified " military action in the region .
mr jones also launched a direct challenge to the prime minister , declaring tony blair " did not speak for wales " by supporting us president george bush .
the party has instead given its support for renewed un weapon inspections in iraq to analyse saddam hussein 's capacity to use weapons of mass destruction .
party ' unconvinced ' plaid cymru said it was not convinced that iraq at present posed any serious threat militarily to the us .
its executive 's statement declared : " plaid cymru - the party of wales - totally opposes escalating military action against iraq by the united states and the uk .
" the party considers that there is no possible justification for such action , given the fact that iraq poses no immediate threat to the united states , and there is no united nations mandate for military intervention . "
mr jones was unequivocal in his opposition to proposed attacks .
" i can not see any justification for military action by the united states in what would be a pre-emptive strike against iraq .
' massive casualties ' " such action would lead to massive casualties , including innocent civilians on both sides in what would inevitably be a prolonged land based conflict .
" tony blair does not speak for wales when he says that he supports george bush on this issue .
" mr blair should re-call parliament urgently so that he can hear the public 's views as expressed by their elected representatives and see for himself how deeply divided his own party is on the issue . "
plaid mep jill evans , the party 's spokesperson on international affairs , warned of a knock-on effect on political stability in the middle east if military action against iraq was carried out .
" the majority of people in wales are opposed to an attack .
it is time the prime minister paid more heed to our demands for peace than president bush 's call to war . "
following the 11 september terror attacks on the us , the party 's annual conference in 2001 urged military restraint and a re-think by mr blair on middle east foreign policy .

the lord chancellor , lord irvine , is expected to receive the recommendation as part of a report from an all-party committee of mps and peers which he set up to consider reforms for the upper house .
one proposal is that any peer sentenced to a prison term of more than 12 months should be automatically disqualified from membership of the house of lords .
best-selling novelist lord archer - who in july last year was sentenced to four years ' imprisonment for perjury - would almost certainly be caught by this new rule if it were adopted .
it would put the house of lords broadly in line with the house of commons , where an mp convicted of a serious offence is automatically disqualified .
retaining title some members of the committee believe that , even if archer is released from prison before such a new rule came into force , he would still be on licence and technically still serving his sentence .
however , if archer was removed from the house of lords he would still retain his title .
he could be stripped of that only by a special act of parliament , since it was awarded under the 1958 life peers act .
parliament seems unlikely to want to go to those lengths .

more than 80 products will be on sale , including beer .
trial run the suppliers are part of plumgarths lakelands food park , in kendal , a collection of buildings equipped to produce food and drink to supermarket standards .

initially the products will be sold together in one part of the store but eventually they will compete alongside well-known brands .

' sustainable future ' sir don said : " in january i highlighted a need for farmers to work together to provide great local products .

by alvin hall finance expert and bbc presenter click here to listen to alvin hall 's wall street : one year on the first thing you notice walking down wall street is how much less crowded it feels and how people walk more slowly .
the atmosphere in the area remains sombre , there is much less of a buzz .
the old excitement seems muted , if not gone .
when i first started working on wall street in the 1980s , most of the big firms had to have an office downtown .
people leave earlier , take vacations more , there 's just a different emphasis on what 's important kate steffek , former wtc worker since the attacks , however , the number of firms leaving the area has increased significantly .
it is currently estimated that about 20 % of office space in the financial sector is empty , even in some of the most famous buildings on wall street .
additionally many workers who witnessed the world trade center attacks have reassessed their priorities .
many have decided to leave new york altogether .
kate steffek worked for a company in the world trade center and many of her colleagues have left new york .
for those who remain in the city , life has changed .
she explains : " for a lot of people work was always the priority , and i think a lot of people after this have decided that others things are more important. they leave earlier , take more vacations , there 's just a different emphasis on what 's important in your life . "
widespread unemployment for many , the emotional trauma is further compounded by unemployment .
it is widespread , having hit all groups from investment bankers and secretaries to service workers .
ground zero : the site of the twin towers jonathan rosen from the new york unemployment project told me : " people who come out of the financial sector think this ca n't be happening to me ... i ca n't be going from over $ 100,000 a year to considering bankruptcy . "
for those with little or no financial reserves , the long period of not earning a wage or salary is proving to be devastating .
unemployment benefits typically last for six months .
the government initially gave an extra three months of benefit to those who have been out of work since 11 september .
but these have , or are about to , run out .
and many of the unemployed are now running out of money and face continued hardship .
emotional trauma like that metal was twisted , that 's the way i feel philip godfrey , former wtc worker but for a number of people who directly experienced the attacks , the lack of a job is the least of their worries .
some are simply too damaged to go back to work yet .
a friend of mine , philip godfrey , was employed as a maintenance worker for a company located in the world trade center .
he , along with other people at his company , managed to make his way down the narrow stairways from the 55th floor to the lobby of tower one , just as tower two collapsed .
philip is lucky to be alive and finds it hard to even think about the future .
he says : " like that metal was twisted , that 's the way i feel . "
talk to anyone who works in the wall street area and it quickly becomes clear that they feel vulnerable - vulnerable to attack , loss , unemployment , and perhaps worst of all , just plain uncertainty .
resilient spirit it makes one wonder if the long resilient spirit that has always been part of the financial markets and wall street itself was also destroyed by the attacks .
alvin hall : wall st workers feel vulnerable then you talk to someone like larry wachtel , a man in his 70s who has worked on wall street for over than 40 years , and you realise the resilience is still in the souls of the people .
larry told me : " it is n't like i got religion , or stopped beating my wife , or anything like that .
i went back to what i usually do . "
and this resilience will live on in the hearts and ambitions of those people who come to wall street in the future .
it may take a generation for a full recovery to happen , but it will happen .
i strongly suspect that the tone of wall street will become more the way it was before the 1990s boom began - a place that is more serious , quieter , and more diligent .
and it is that work ethic that will pave the way to a recovery , as it always has .

they have promised that the remainder will be freed in the next few days .
but it has been announced that one of the hostages has died in captivity .
whilst no official statement has come from the group , it seems the kidnapping operation was not for ransom but to send a message to the new hard-line government of president alvaro uribe .
going home ten households in colombia rushed to prepare welcome home parties for their loved ones , four women and six men , as they were released by the marxist eln .
uribe says he will take a tough line snatched last month in a daring mass kidnapping operation , the eln herded 27 tourists enjoying the fishing and beaches of choco , on the pacific coast , into captivity in the jungle .
normally , kidnappings , of which there is an average of one every three hours in colombia , are about ransoms .
the guerrillas are the main kidnappers and they use the ransoms - estimated to run at over $ 100m a year - to finance their 38-year war on the state .
but the eln has released these hostages with a promise to free all those taken in the latest operation without charging ransom as a humanitarian gesture .
sending a message for " humanitarian gesture " read " political gesture " as analysts here see the eln sending a clear message to president uribe .
he has pledged to crack down on the warring factions , has instituted an unprecedented set of security measures and is pouring money into strengthening the country 's battered armed forces .
the eln , which has been searching for a peace agreement since 1997 , is seeking to prod the new government into agreeing to its terms for a peace process .
if not , the guerrillas have shown they can make life very difficult for the government , escalating their kidnapping and terrorising the civilian population .
but president uribe has his sights set on fighting the rebels , not talking to them .
former president andres pastrana tried that with the larger rebel group , the farc , or revolutionary armed forces of colombia , and got nowhere .
president uribe has said he will talk to the rebels but it will be on his terms , and those seem to be with a rifle pressed to their heads . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jeremy mcdermott " it was n't so much a humanitarian gesture as a political one " key stories uribe 's tough task security crisis escalation fears farc losing support the human cost q & a : us role background farmers lose drugs war mass exodus female fighters country profile profiles farc : powerful rebels eln : expert kidnappers auc : growing force alvaro uribe velez talking point can the new president bring peace ?

but behind the sporting passion lies a marketers ' dream .
the crowds watching matches fits a very specific sales demographic .
they have two passions ... one is sport , the other is home ownership tony davis put the right brand in front of them , the theory goes , and you 'll get a positive response .
since the 2000 olympic games , australia has become one of the most commercially viable centres for sports branding in the world .
there is barely a team or a stadium without a corporate sponsor these days .
earlier this year , mortgage lender " aussie home loans " signed a five-year naming rights deal for the sydney football stadium .
overnight , the ground became aussie stadium and the company has n't looked back .
tony davis , general manager of marketing for aussie , came up with the stadium branding idea .
" you get an association with the heart of the australian psyche and that is sport .
they have two passions it seems to me in australia .
one is sport , the other is home ownership .
so a mortgage company is not a bad organization to actually sponsor a stadium . "
expensive game putting your name up in lights does n't come cheap though .
branding deals for some of australia 's top venues run at about $ 5m a year .
nor does it stop there , if you sponsor a stadium everything from the quality of the food to the seating ends up reflecting on the sponsor .
for the most successful sports branding deals , naming rights are just the beginning of the process .
the trick is to build a whole marketing strategy around the sponsorship - and that can become an expensive business as greg daniel , chief executive of marketing strategists " issues and images " explains .
" you can use a rule of thumb that says for every dollar that you spend on sponsorship you probably have to spend two dollars more on leveraging that sponsorship to make it really work for you .
" i think this is again what people found out during the olympics games , that they may have been spending $ 50m on sponsorship but that was simply the entry fee .
" they then had to spend another $ 100m leveraging the sponsorship through advertising , promotion , marketing and other things .
the ones that did that were wildly successful . "
a losing game ?
but branding sports is n't a one-way bet .
a poor team performance can drag the sponsor 's name down but the real problems come when sponsors get into difficulty .
enron signed a $ 100m deal to be naming sponsor for the houston astros new stadium .
as details of enron 's financial wrongdoing came out , the astros ' public image suffered .
in the end , the astros bailed out of the deal but had to pay enron $ 2.1m for the privilege .
they are now sponsored by the altogether less controversial minute maid juice company .
so , sports branding has its risks .
but , fittingly for a nation obsessed with its sport , australian marketers have an adage .
the public , they say , are always ahead of the game .

by ian youngs bbc news online entertainment staff for millions of people around the world , the images of the attacks on the world trade center on 11 september had a resonance that was a little too striking .
they had seen all this before - but in the harmless surroundings of a darkened room with a bucket of popcorn in their laps .
nobody actually died in towering inferno or independence day .
but there was a sense of guilt that hollywood could have offered such terrible events up as entertainment - even leading some to suggest that the hijackers had got the idea from the movies .
the days following 11 september saw a number of film-makers predict that hollywood would never be the same again .
" i think it 's going to change the way we think about everything - i really do , " said uk director mike figgis .
new yorker woody allen also predicted that the film world would steer clear of subjects that were too close for comfort .
images of the world trade center were immediately erased from films , including spider-man and new york-set romantic comedy serendipity .
film studios put several films with sensitive subject matter on hold - but they were all released within nine months of the tragedy .
the biggest of the films put back on the shelf was collateral damage , starring arnold schwarzenegger as a firefighter whose family is killed when terrorists blow up a skyscraper .
it was originally scheduled to be released on 5 october - but was held back until the studio bosses decided that enough time had passed , which turned out to be 8 february .
it certainly still held a horrific resonance for some - but still took $ 40m -lrb- £ 26m -rrb- at the us box office , which was more than schwarzenegger 's last action movie , the 6th day .
some analysts even said that , rather than shying away from the subject , people wanted to see more of it to help them make sense of the events .
others said that the public wanted to see happy endings - which hollywood , unlike real life , invariably provides .
certainly , the numbers of people renting action videos has gone up in the wake of 11 september .
collateral damage 's director , andy davis , said : " people were interested in visiting this world , not running away from it . "
another potentially difficult film , the sum of all fears , centres on terrorists exploding a nuclear bomb in the city of baltimore .
it opened in the united states at the end of may - taking $ 120m -lrb- £ 77m -rrb- and , like the other movies , avoided a backlash .
but producers had removed the most graphic scenes and were keen to trumpet the support it received from the pentagon .
hollywood seems to have been tentatively testing what cinema-goers are willing to stomach .
one screenwriter , ron hutchinson , said film-makers had initially panicked because they realised " the burglars were in the house " .
but now hollywood had " found the gun in the tin-box under the bed and is shooting back " , he told bbc radio 4 .
although disaster movies are now back on the agenda , some within the film industry say it is still not back to normal .
" a year is not enough time to weigh the nature of the profound change we will go through because of what happened , " actor tom hanks recently said .
oscar-winning director steven soderbergh said he still did not know what the long-term repercussions would be for the film-making community .
" but i do n't think its impact is over , " he said .
some unlikely films have been dealing with the events of 11 september .
the sequel to stuart little , the children 's saga about a mouse that is adopted by a manhattan family , includes a sequence in which the mouse flies amid the skyscrapers in a toy plane .
" in mortal peril in new york air-space , stuart is able to parachute safely to the ground , " guardian and radio 4 commentator mark lawson said .
" surely these scenes were a cathartic re-imagining of 11 september . "
but one type of film that is only now beginning to be attempted is stories directly dealing with the events of 11 september .
it has been reported that a tv movie about flight 93 , the hijacked plane which crashed on 11 september in pennsylvania , called manifest courage , is being planned by actress goldie hawn 's production company .
a series of short films about the global reaction to the attacks , by directors including directors including mira nair , sean penn , youssef chahine and shohei imamura , have been criticised for being " stridently anti-american " .
but the first feature film about the day to hit cinemas will be the guys , based on the true story of a new york fire captain who lost eight men in the attacks and a journalist who helped write elegies for them .
starring sigourney weaver and anthony lapaglia , it is based on a play that has been running in manhattan since december , and the film will get its world première this 11 september at the toronto film festival .
" it 's important for this particular piece to have it out and have it be seen as soon as possible , " director jim simpson said .
" the mode of reacting to something like this is to forget and move on , and i do n't know that 's always the best idea . "

finance minister andy kerr will announce this week how £ 4.1bn is to be spent over three years .
the money was earmarked for scotland in july 's spending review , although the scottish executive has the final say on how the cash is spent .
the snp argues that this figure hugely overstates the real money being made available .
leader john swinney said treasury documents showed that only £ 100m would be added to the value of scottish spending in the next year - rather than the £ 1.5bn being claimed by the government .
he said this was down to a combination of old money already announced and a change in accountancy practice .
already announced " labour is engaged in a massive con against the scottish public , " claimed mr swinney .
" they have engaged in an outrageous attempt at enron-style accounting .
" first they changed the way the figures are calculated to increase the total without adding a single penny to spending , and then they added in money that has already been announced . "
he has got it completely wrong and i look forward to him eating a very big portion of humble pie " andy kerr finance minister " the result is that they have been claiming a spending bonanza and spinning stories about huge improvements in transport and the public services , when in fact the money is little more than a figment of their imagination . "
his accusations have infuriated labour ministers , who condemned what they described as disgraceful allegations .
they said that the snp had spotlighted a single treasury column which dealt with an accountancy adjustment .
mr kerr said the cash available to the scottish executive would definitely rise by £ 4.1bn over three years .
he said mr swinney had made a political gaffe - and suggested that the snp leader should be worried about thursday 's announcement .
" he has got it completely wrong and i look forward to him eating a very big portion of humble pie , " he added .
