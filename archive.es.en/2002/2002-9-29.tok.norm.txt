but what isn ’ t is the fact that levi strauss was born in southern germany .
a museum in his birth-place hopes to change that . the stories of the birth of the quintessentially american blue jeans have achieved an almost myth-like status .
from the heady days of the california gold rush of 1849 to levi strauss ’ move to the wild west armed with a supply of canvas , needles , thread and scissors .
from strauss ' search for the perfect sturdy overalls for the miners labouring in the gold mines to the creation of the first riveted pants made of serge de nimes or denim - the legends of ruggedness and innovation have come to embody the american dream .
tracing levi strauss to southern germany but few know that the man behind the world ’ s most famous jeans was born on the other side of the atlantic - in a village in southern germany between the cities of bamberg and nuremberg .
not even the 3,000 inhabitants of upper-franconian buttenheim , knew that their village could lay claim to such a famous son till almost 20 years ago .
in 1983 historians stumbled upon levi strauss ’ name in the jewish birth register of the village .
further research led them to strauss ’ home where he spent his first 18 years with his parents and six siblings .
born in buttenheim on february 26 , 1829 , strauss was the son of a jewish salesman , who sold his wares of scarves and other assorted items from door to door and just about managed to sustain his nine-member family .
after the death of his father in 1846 , strauss ’ mother decided to emigrate to america the following year with her three youngest children .
that ’ s where levi strauss invented his iconic blue jeans and the rest , as they say , is history .
keeping the memory of strauss ’ origins alive but despite catching on late to the legend of levi strauss , the village of buttenheim has been quick to capitalise on the global popularity of their most famous citizen .
in 1987 , authorities in buttenheim decided to preserve the memory of their most famous citizen , especially strauss ’ early years spent in their village .
they bought strauss ’ crumbling half-timbered family house , painstakingly restored it and turned it into a museum two years ago dedicated to the life and invention of löb strauss as he was originally known .
this week the levi strauss museum jeans & cult in the idyllic buttenheim quietly remembers the 100th birth anniversary of the legendary inventor whose name is almost synonymous with jeans today .
visitors to the museum can get a peep into the life of levi strauss from the time of his birth to his emigration to america on the ground floor of the former strauss residence with the help of graphics , photo documentation and audio material .
die-hard levis-wearers can educate themselves on the origins of their beloved jeans on a floor dedicated to the world of denim and indigo .
right from strauss ’ early creations of sturdy riveted workpants guaranteed to withstand the most arduous strain to his flagship levi ’ s 501 jeans stitched in 1890 , the visitor can get a feel of how the world ’ s most famous jeans came into being .
besides levis jeans , the strauss museum in buttenheim also provides insights into the development of the general denim industry and the techniques involved in dying and treating the material .
undoubtedly the highlight of the exhibition is the " original jeans " from 1890 , the legendary 501 from a private collection .
mecca for levis fans much like elvis presley ’ s house in graceland , the modest museum in buttenheim has become a mecca for the world-wide levis fan-group .
some 12,000 fans travel here every year to find out more about the history of the jeans gracing their legs .

but what isn ’ t is the fact that levi strauss was born in southern germany .
a museum in his birth-place hopes to change that . the stories of the birth of the quintessentially american blue jeans have achieved an almost myth-like status .
from the heady days of the california gold rush of 1849 to levi strauss ’ move to the wild west armed with a supply of canvas , needles , thread and scissors .
from strauss ' search for the perfect sturdy overalls for the miners labouring in the gold mines to the creation of the first riveted pants made of serge de nimes or denim - the legends of ruggedness and innovation have come to embody the american dream .
tracing levi strauss to southern germany but few know that the man behind the world ’ s most famous jeans was born on the other side of the atlantic - in a village in southern germany between the cities of bamberg and nuremberg .
not even the 3,000 inhabitants of upper-franconian buttenheim , knew that their village could lay claim to such a famous son till almost 20 years ago .
in 1983 historians stumbled upon levi strauss ’ name in the jewish birth register of the village .
further research led them to strauss ’ home where he spent his first 18 years with his parents and six siblings .
born in buttenheim on february 26 , 1829 , strauss was the son of a jewish salesman , who sold his wares of scarves and other assorted items from door to door and just about managed to sustain his nine-member family .
after the death of his father in 1846 , strauss ’ mother decided to emigrate to america the following year with her three youngest children .
that ’ s where levi strauss invented his iconic blue jeans and the rest , as they say , is history .
keeping the memory of strauss ’ origins alive but despite catching on late to the legend of levi strauss , the village of buttenheim has been quick to capitalise on the global popularity of their most famous citizen .
in 1987 , authorities in buttenheim decided to preserve the memory of their most famous citizen , especially strauss ’ early years spent in their village .
they bought strauss ’ crumbling half-timbered family house , painstakingly restored it and turned it into a museum two years ago dedicated to the life and invention of löb strauss as he was originally known .
this week the levi strauss museum jeans & cult in the idyllic buttenheim quietly remembers the 100th birth anniversary of the legendary inventor whose name is almost synonymous with jeans today .
visitors to the museum can get a peep into the life of levi strauss from the time of his birth to his emigration to america on the ground floor of the former strauss residence with the help of graphics , photo documentation and audio material .
die-hard levis-wearers can educate themselves on the origins of their beloved jeans on a floor dedicated to the world of denim and indigo .
right from strauss ’ early creations of sturdy riveted workpants guaranteed to withstand the most arduous strain to his flagship levi ’ s 501 jeans stitched in 1890 , the visitor can get a feel of how the world ’ s most famous jeans came into being .
besides levis jeans , the strauss museum in buttenheim also provides insights into the development of the general denim industry and the techniques involved in dying and treating the material .
undoubtedly the highlight of the exhibition is the " original jeans " from 1890 , the legendary 501 from a private collection .
mecca for levis fans much like elvis presley ’ s house in graceland , the modest museum in buttenheim has become a mecca for the world-wide levis fan-group .
some 12,000 fans travel here every year to find out more about the history of the jeans gracing their legs .
the museum is also one of the last remaining remnants from the life of the man who created the greatest icon of american culture .

but what isn ’ t is the fact that levi strauss was born in southern germany .
a museum in his birth-place hopes to change that . the stories of the birth of the quintessentially american blue jeans have achieved an almost myth-like status .
from the heady days of the california gold rush of 1849 to levi strauss ’ move to the wild west armed with a supply of canvas , needles , thread and scissors .
from strauss ' search for the perfect sturdy overalls for the miners labouring in the gold mines to the creation of the first riveted pants made of serge de nimes or denim - the legends of ruggedness and innovation have come to embody the american dream .
tracing levi strauss to southern germany but few know that the man behind the world ’ s most famous jeans was born on the other side of the atlantic - in a village in southern germany between the cities of bamberg and nuremberg .
not even the 3,000 inhabitants of upper-franconian buttenheim , knew that their village could lay claim to such a famous son till almost 20 years ago .
in 1983 historians stumbled upon levi strauss ’ name in the jewish birth register of the village .
further research led them to strauss ’ home where he spent his first 18 years with his parents and six siblings .
born in buttenheim on february 26 , 1829 , strauss was the son of a jewish salesman , who sold his wares of scarves and other assorted items from door to door and just about managed to sustain his nine-member family .
after the death of his father in 1846 , strauss ’ mother decided to emigrate to america the following year with her three youngest children .
that ’ s where levi strauss invented his iconic blue jeans and the rest , as they say , is history .
keeping the memory of strauss ’ origins alive but despite catching on late to the legend of levi strauss , the village of buttenheim has been quick to capitalise on the global popularity of their most famous citizen .
in 1987 , authorities in buttenheim decided to preserve the memory of their most famous citizen , especially strauss ’ early years spent in their village .
they bought strauss ’ crumbling half-timbered family house , painstakingly restored it and turned it into a museum two years ago dedicated to the life and invention of löb strauss as he was originally known .
this week the levi strauss museum jeans & cult in the idyllic buttenheim quietly remembers the 100th birth anniversary of the legendary inventor whose name is almost synonymous with jeans today .
visitors to the museum can get a peep into the life of levi strauss from the time of his birth to his emigration to america on the ground floor of the former strauss residence with the help of graphics , photo documentation and audio material .
die-hard levis-wearers can educate themselves on the origins of their beloved jeans on a floor dedicated to the world of denim and indigo .

but what isn ’ t is the fact that levi strauss was born in southern germany .
a museum in his birth-place hopes to change that . the stories of the birth of the quintessentially american blue jeans have achieved an almost myth-like status .
from the heady days of the california gold rush of 1849 to levi strauss ’ move to the wild west armed with a supply of canvas , needles , thread and scissors .
from strauss ' search for the perfect sturdy overalls for the miners labouring in the gold mines to the creation of the first riveted pants made of serge de nimes or denim - the legends of ruggedness and innovation have come to embody the american dream .
tracing levi strauss to southern germany but few know that the man behind the world ’ s most famous jeans was born on the other side of the atlantic - in a village in southern germany between the cities of bamberg and nuremberg .
not even the 3,000 inhabitants of upper-franconian buttenheim , knew that their village could lay claim to such a famous son till almost 20 years ago .
in 1983 historians stumbled upon levi strauss ’ name in the jewish birth register of the village .
further research led them to strauss ’ home where he spent his first 18 years with his parents and six siblings .
born in buttenheim on february 26 , 1829 , strauss was the son of a jewish salesman , who sold his wares of scarves and other assorted items from door to door and just about managed to sustain his nine-member family .
after the death of his father in 1846 , strauss ’ mother decided to emigrate to america the following year with her three youngest children .
that ’ s where levi strauss invented his iconic blue jeans and the rest , as they say , is history .
keeping the memory of strauss ’ origins alive but despite catching on late to the legend of levi strauss , the village of buttenheim has been quick to capitalise on the global popularity of their most famous citizen .
in 1987 , authorities in buttenheim decided to preserve the memory of their most famous citizen , especially strauss ’ early years spent in their village .
they bought strauss ’ crumbling half-timbered family house , painstakingly restored it and turned it into a museum two years ago dedicated to the life and invention of löb strauss as he was originally known .
this week the levi strauss museum jeans & cult in the idyllic buttenheim quietly remembers the 100th birth anniversary of the legendary inventor whose name is almost synonymous with jeans today .
visitors to the museum can get a peep into the life of levi strauss from the time of his birth to his emigration to america on the ground floor of the former strauss residence with the help of graphics , photo documentation and audio material .
die-hard levis-wearers can educate themselves on the origins of their beloved jeans on a floor dedicated to the world of denim and indigo .
right from strauss ’ early creations of sturdy riveted workpants guaranteed to withstand the most arduous strain to his flagship levi ’ s 501 jeans stitched in 1890 , the visitor can get a feel of how the world ’ s most famous jeans came into being .
besides levis jeans , the strauss museum in buttenheim also provides insights into the development of the general denim industry and the techniques involved in dying and treating the material .
undoubtedly the highlight of the exhibition is the " original jeans " from 1890 , the legendary 501 from a private collection .
mecca for levis fans much like elvis presley ’ s house in graceland , the modest museum in buttenheim has become a mecca for the world-wide levis fan-group .
some 12,000 fans travel here every year to find out more about the history of the jeans gracing their legs .

but what isn ’ t is the fact that levi strauss was born in southern germany .
a museum in his birth-place hopes to change that . the stories of the birth of the quintessentially american blue jeans have achieved an almost myth-like status .
from the heady days of the california gold rush of 1849 to levi strauss ’ move to the wild west armed with a supply of canvas , needles , thread and scissors .
from strauss ' search for the perfect sturdy overalls for the miners labouring in the gold mines to the creation of the first riveted pants made of serge de nimes or denim - the legends of ruggedness and innovation have come to embody the american dream .
tracing levi strauss to southern germany but few know that the man behind the world ’ s most famous jeans was born on the other side of the atlantic - in a village in southern germany between the cities of bamberg and nuremberg .
not even the 3,000 inhabitants of upper-franconian buttenheim , knew that their village could lay claim to such a famous son till almost 20 years ago .
in 1983 historians stumbled upon levi strauss ’ name in the jewish birth register of the village .
further research led them to strauss ’ home where he spent his first 18 years with his parents and six siblings .
born in buttenheim on february 26 , 1829 , strauss was the son of a jewish salesman , who sold his wares of scarves and other assorted items from door to door and just about managed to sustain his nine-member family .
after the death of his father in 1846 , strauss ’ mother decided to emigrate to america the following year with her three youngest children .
that ’ s where levi strauss invented his iconic blue jeans and the rest , as they say , is history .
keeping the memory of strauss ’ origins alive but despite catching on late to the legend of levi strauss , the village of buttenheim has been quick to capitalise on the global popularity of their most famous citizen .
in 1987 , authorities in buttenheim decided to preserve the memory of their most famous citizen , especially strauss ’ early years spent in their village .
they bought strauss ’ crumbling half-timbered family house , painstakingly restored it and turned it into a museum two years ago dedicated to the life and invention of löb strauss as he was originally known .
this week the levi strauss museum jeans & cult in the idyllic buttenheim quietly remembers the 100th birth anniversary of the legendary inventor whose name is almost synonymous with jeans today .
visitors to the museum can get a peep into the life of levi strauss from the time of his birth to his emigration to america on the ground floor of the former strauss residence with the help of graphics , photo documentation and audio material .
die-hard levis-wearers can educate themselves on the origins of their beloved jeans on a floor dedicated to the world of denim and indigo .
right from strauss ’ early creations of sturdy riveted workpants guaranteed to withstand the most arduous strain to his flagship levi ’ s 501 jeans stitched in 1890 , the visitor can get a feel of how the world ’ s most famous jeans came into being .
besides levis jeans , the strauss museum in buttenheim also provides insights into the development of the general denim industry and the techniques involved in dying and treating the material .
undoubtedly the highlight of the exhibition is the " original jeans " from 1890 , the legendary 501 from a private collection .
mecca for levis fans much like elvis presley ’ s house in graceland , the modest museum in buttenheim has become a mecca for the world-wide levis fan-group .
some 12,000 fans travel here every year to find out more about the history of the jeans gracing their legs .

but what isn ’ t is the fact that levi strauss was born in southern germany .
a museum in his birth-place hopes to change that . the stories of the birth of the quintessentially american blue jeans have achieved an almost myth-like status .
from the heady days of the california gold rush of 1849 to levi strauss ’ move to the wild west armed with a supply of canvas , needles , thread and scissors .
from strauss ' search for the perfect sturdy overalls for the miners labouring in the gold mines to the creation of the first riveted pants made of serge de nimes or denim - the legends of ruggedness and innovation have come to embody the american dream .
tracing levi strauss to southern germany but few know that the man behind the world ’ s most famous jeans was born on the other side of the atlantic - in a village in southern germany between the cities of bamberg and nuremberg .
not even the 3,000 inhabitants of upper-franconian buttenheim , knew that their village could lay claim to such a famous son till almost 20 years ago .
in 1983 historians stumbled upon levi strauss ’ name in the jewish birth register of the village .
further research led them to strauss ’ home where he spent his first 18 years with his parents and six siblings .
born in buttenheim on february 26 , 1829 , strauss was the son of a jewish salesman , who sold his wares of scarves and other assorted items from door to door and just about managed to sustain his nine-member family .
after the death of his father in 1846 , strauss ’ mother decided to emigrate to america the following year with her three youngest children .
that ’ s where levi strauss invented his iconic blue jeans and the rest , as they say , is history .
keeping the memory of strauss ’ origins alive but despite catching on late to the legend of levi strauss , the village of buttenheim has been quick to capitalise on the global popularity of their most famous citizen .
in 1987 , authorities in buttenheim decided to preserve the memory of their most famous citizen , especially strauss ’ early years spent in their village .
they bought strauss ’ crumbling half-timbered family house , painstakingly restored it and turned it into a museum two years ago dedicated to the life and invention of löb strauss as he was originally known .
this week the levi strauss museum jeans & cult in the idyllic buttenheim quietly remembers the 100th birth anniversary of the legendary inventor whose name is almost synonymous with jeans today .
visitors to the museum can get a peep into the life of levi strauss from the time of his birth to his emigration to america on the ground floor of the former strauss residence with the help of graphics , photo documentation and audio material .
die-hard levis-wearers can educate themselves on the origins of their beloved jeans on a floor dedicated to the world of denim and indigo .
right from strauss ’ early creations of sturdy riveted workpants guaranteed to withstand the most arduous strain to his flagship levi ’ s 501 jeans stitched in 1890 , the visitor can get a feel of how the world ’ s most famous jeans came into being .
besides levis jeans , the strauss museum in buttenheim also provides insights into the development of the general denim industry and the techniques involved in dying and treating the material .
undoubtedly the highlight of the exhibition is the " original jeans " from 1890 , the legendary 501 from a private collection .
mecca for levis fans much like elvis presley ’ s house in graceland , the modest museum in buttenheim has become a mecca for the world-wide levis fan-group .
some 12,000 fans travel here every year to find out more about the history of the jeans gracing their legs .
the museum is also one of the last remaining remnants from the life of the man who created the greatest icon of american culture .
a huge earthquake in 1906 in san francisco wiped out levi strauss ’ company and production factories in san francisco . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

but what isn ’ t is the fact that levi strauss was born in southern germany .
a museum in his birth-place hopes to change that . the stories of the birth of the quintessentially american blue jeans have achieved an almost myth-like status .
from the heady days of the california gold rush of 1849 to levi strauss ’ move to the wild west armed with a supply of canvas , needles , thread and scissors .
from strauss ' search for the perfect sturdy overalls for the miners labouring in the gold mines to the creation of the first riveted pants made of serge de nimes or denim - the legends of ruggedness and innovation have come to embody the american dream .
tracing levi strauss to southern germany but few know that the man behind the world ’ s most famous jeans was born on the other side of the atlantic - in a village in southern germany between the cities of bamberg and nuremberg .
not even the 3,000 inhabitants of upper-franconian buttenheim , knew that their village could lay claim to such a famous son till almost 20 years ago .
in 1983 historians stumbled upon levi strauss ’ name in the jewish birth register of the village .
further research led them to strauss ’ home where he spent his first 18 years with his parents and six siblings .
born in buttenheim on february 26 , 1829 , strauss was the son of a jewish salesman , who sold his wares of scarves and other assorted items from door to door and just about managed to sustain his nine-member family .
after the death of his father in 1846 , strauss ’ mother decided to emigrate to america the following year with her three youngest children .
that ’ s where levi strauss invented his iconic blue jeans and the rest , as they say , is history .
keeping the memory of strauss ’ origins alive but despite catching on late to the legend of levi strauss , the village of buttenheim has been quick to capitalise on the global popularity of their most famous citizen .
in 1987 , authorities in buttenheim decided to preserve the memory of their most famous citizen , especially strauss ’ early years spent in their village .
they bought strauss ’ crumbling half-timbered family house , painstakingly restored it and turned it into a museum two years ago dedicated to the life and invention of löb strauss as he was originally known .
this week the levi strauss museum jeans & cult in the idyllic buttenheim quietly remembers the 100th birth anniversary of the legendary inventor whose name is almost synonymous with jeans today .
visitors to the museum can get a peep into the life of levi strauss from the time of his birth to his emigration to america on the ground floor of the former strauss residence with the help of graphics , photo documentation and audio material .
die-hard levis-wearers can educate themselves on the origins of their beloved jeans on a floor dedicated to the world of denim and indigo .
right from strauss ’ early creations of sturdy riveted workpants guaranteed to withstand the most arduous strain to his flagship levi ’ s 501 jeans stitched in 1890 , the visitor can get a feel of how the world ’ s most famous jeans came into being .
besides levis jeans , the strauss museum in buttenheim also provides insights into the development of the general denim industry and the techniques involved in dying and treating the material .

but what isn ’ t is the fact that levi strauss was born in southern germany .
a museum in his birth-place hopes to change that . the stories of the birth of the quintessentially american blue jeans have achieved an almost myth-like status .
from the heady days of the california gold rush of 1849 to levi strauss ’ move to the wild west armed with a supply of canvas , needles , thread and scissors .
from strauss ' search for the perfect sturdy overalls for the miners labouring in the gold mines to the creation of the first riveted pants made of serge de nimes or denim - the legends of ruggedness and innovation have come to embody the american dream .
tracing levi strauss to southern germany but few know that the man behind the world ’ s most famous jeans was born on the other side of the atlantic - in a village in southern germany between the cities of bamberg and nuremberg .
not even the 3,000 inhabitants of upper-franconian buttenheim , knew that their village could lay claim to such a famous son till almost 20 years ago .
in 1983 historians stumbled upon levi strauss ’ name in the jewish birth register of the village .
further research led them to strauss ’ home where he spent his first 18 years with his parents and six siblings .
born in buttenheim on february 26 , 1829 , strauss was the son of a jewish salesman , who sold his wares of scarves and other assorted items from door to door and just about managed to sustain his nine-member family .
after the death of his father in 1846 , strauss ’ mother decided to emigrate to america the following year with her three youngest children .
that ’ s where levi strauss invented his iconic blue jeans and the rest , as they say , is history .
keeping the memory of strauss ’ origins alive but despite catching on late to the legend of levi strauss , the village of buttenheim has been quick to capitalise on the global popularity of their most famous citizen .
in 1987 , authorities in buttenheim decided to preserve the memory of their most famous citizen , especially strauss ’ early years spent in their village .
they bought strauss ’ crumbling half-timbered family house , painstakingly restored it and turned it into a museum two years ago dedicated to the life and invention of löb strauss as he was originally known .
this week the levi strauss museum jeans & cult in the idyllic buttenheim quietly remembers the 100th birth anniversary of the legendary inventor whose name is almost synonymous with jeans today .
visitors to the museum can get a peep into the life of levi strauss from the time of his birth to his emigration to america on the ground floor of the former strauss residence with the help of graphics , photo documentation and audio material .
die-hard levis-wearers can educate themselves on the origins of their beloved jeans on a floor dedicated to the world of denim and indigo .
right from strauss ’ early creations of sturdy riveted workpants guaranteed to withstand the most arduous strain to his flagship levi ’ s 501 jeans stitched in 1890 , the visitor can get a feel of how the world ’ s most famous jeans came into being .
besides levis jeans , the strauss museum in buttenheim also provides insights into the development of the general denim industry and the techniques involved in dying and treating the material .
undoubtedly the highlight of the exhibition is the " original jeans " from 1890 , the legendary 501 from a private collection .
mecca for levis fans much like elvis presley ’ s house in graceland , the modest museum in buttenheim has become a mecca for the world-wide levis fan-group .
some 12,000 fans travel here every year to find out more about the history of the jeans gracing their legs .
the museum is also one of the last remaining remnants from the life of the man who created the greatest icon of american culture .

but what isn ’ t is the fact that levi strauss was born in southern germany .
a museum in his birth-place hopes to change that . the stories of the birth of the quintessentially american blue jeans have achieved an almost myth-like status .
from the heady days of the california gold rush of 1849 to levi strauss ’ move to the wild west armed with a supply of canvas , needles , thread and scissors .
from strauss ' search for the perfect sturdy overalls for the miners labouring in the gold mines to the creation of the first riveted pants made of serge de nimes or denim - the legends of ruggedness and innovation have come to embody the american dream .
tracing levi strauss to southern germany but few know that the man behind the world ’ s most famous jeans was born on the other side of the atlantic - in a village in southern germany between the cities of bamberg and nuremberg .
not even the 3,000 inhabitants of upper-franconian buttenheim , knew that their village could lay claim to such a famous son till almost 20 years ago .
in 1983 historians stumbled upon levi strauss ’ name in the jewish birth register of the village .
further research led them to strauss ’ home where he spent his first 18 years with his parents and six siblings .
born in buttenheim on february 26 , 1829 , strauss was the son of a jewish salesman , who sold his wares of scarves and other assorted items from door to door and just about managed to sustain his nine-member family .
after the death of his father in 1846 , strauss ’ mother decided to emigrate to america the following year with her three youngest children .
that ’ s where levi strauss invented his iconic blue jeans and the rest , as they say , is history .
keeping the memory of strauss ’ origins alive but despite catching on late to the legend of levi strauss , the village of buttenheim has been quick to capitalise on the global popularity of their most famous citizen .
in 1987 , authorities in buttenheim decided to preserve the memory of their most famous citizen , especially strauss ’ early years spent in their village .
they bought strauss ’ crumbling half-timbered family house , painstakingly restored it and turned it into a museum two years ago dedicated to the life and invention of löb strauss as he was originally known .
this week the levi strauss museum jeans & cult in the idyllic buttenheim quietly remembers the 100th birth anniversary of the legendary inventor whose name is almost synonymous with jeans today .
visitors to the museum can get a peep into the life of levi strauss from the time of his birth to his emigration to america on the ground floor of the former strauss residence with the help of graphics , photo documentation and audio material .
die-hard levis-wearers can educate themselves on the origins of their beloved jeans on a floor dedicated to the world of denim and indigo .
right from strauss ’ early creations of sturdy riveted workpants guaranteed to withstand the most arduous strain to his flagship levi ’ s 501 jeans stitched in 1890 , the visitor can get a feel of how the world ’ s most famous jeans came into being .
besides levis jeans , the strauss museum in buttenheim also provides insights into the development of the general denim industry and the techniques involved in dying and treating the material .
undoubtedly the highlight of the exhibition is the " original jeans " from 1890 , the legendary 501 from a private collection .
mecca for levis fans much like elvis presley ’ s house in graceland , the modest museum in buttenheim has become a mecca for the world-wide levis fan-group .
some 12,000 fans travel here every year to find out more about the history of the jeans gracing their legs .
the museum is also one of the last remaining remnants from the life of the man who created the greatest icon of american culture .

but what isn ’ t is the fact that levi strauss was born in southern germany .
a museum in his birth-place hopes to change that . the stories of the birth of the quintessentially american blue jeans have achieved an almost myth-like status .
from the heady days of the california gold rush of 1849 to levi strauss ’ move to the wild west armed with a supply of canvas , needles , thread and scissors .
from strauss ' search for the perfect sturdy overalls for the miners labouring in the gold mines to the creation of the first riveted pants made of serge de nimes or denim - the legends of ruggedness and innovation have come to embody the american dream .
tracing levi strauss to southern germany but few know that the man behind the world ’ s most famous jeans was born on the other side of the atlantic - in a village in southern germany between the cities of bamberg and nuremberg .
not even the 3,000 inhabitants of upper-franconian buttenheim , knew that their village could lay claim to such a famous son till almost 20 years ago .
in 1983 historians stumbled upon levi strauss ’ name in the jewish birth register of the village .
further research led them to strauss ’ home where he spent his first 18 years with his parents and six siblings .
born in buttenheim on february 26 , 1829 , strauss was the son of a jewish salesman , who sold his wares of scarves and other assorted items from door to door and just about managed to sustain his nine-member family .
after the death of his father in 1846 , strauss ’ mother decided to emigrate to america the following year with her three youngest children .
that ’ s where levi strauss invented his iconic blue jeans and the rest , as they say , is history .
keeping the memory of strauss ’ origins alive but despite catching on late to the legend of levi strauss , the village of buttenheim has been quick to capitalise on the global popularity of their most famous citizen .
in 1987 , authorities in buttenheim decided to preserve the memory of their most famous citizen , especially strauss ’ early years spent in their village .
they bought strauss ’ crumbling half-timbered family house , painstakingly restored it and turned it into a museum two years ago dedicated to the life and invention of löb strauss as he was originally known .
this week the levi strauss museum jeans & cult in the idyllic buttenheim quietly remembers the 100th birth anniversary of the legendary inventor whose name is almost synonymous with jeans today .
visitors to the museum can get a peep into the life of levi strauss from the time of his birth to his emigration to america on the ground floor of the former strauss residence with the help of graphics , photo documentation and audio material .
die-hard levis-wearers can educate themselves on the origins of their beloved jeans on a floor dedicated to the world of denim and indigo .
right from strauss ’ early creations of sturdy riveted workpants guaranteed to withstand the most arduous strain to his flagship levi ’ s 501 jeans stitched in 1890 , the visitor can get a feel of how the world ’ s most famous jeans came into being .
besides levis jeans , the strauss museum in buttenheim also provides insights into the development of the general denim industry and the techniques involved in dying and treating the material .
undoubtedly the highlight of the exhibition is the " original jeans " from 1890 , the legendary 501 from a private collection .
mecca for levis fans much like elvis presley ’ s house in graceland , the modest museum in buttenheim has become a mecca for the world-wide levis fan-group .
some 12,000 fans travel here every year to find out more about the history of the jeans gracing their legs .
the museum is also one of the last remaining remnants from the life of the man who created the greatest icon of american culture .

but what isn ’ t is the fact that levi strauss was born in southern germany .
a museum in his birth-place hopes to change that . the stories of the birth of the quintessentially american blue jeans have achieved an almost myth-like status .
from the heady days of the california gold rush of 1849 to levi strauss ’ move to the wild west armed with a supply of canvas , needles , thread and scissors .
from strauss ' search for the perfect sturdy overalls for the miners labouring in the gold mines to the creation of the first riveted pants made of serge de nimes or denim - the legends of ruggedness and innovation have come to embody the american dream .
tracing levi strauss to southern germany but few know that the man behind the world ’ s most famous jeans was born on the other side of the atlantic - in a village in southern germany between the cities of bamberg and nuremberg .
not even the 3,000 inhabitants of upper-franconian buttenheim , knew that their village could lay claim to such a famous son till almost 20 years ago .
in 1983 historians stumbled upon levi strauss ’ name in the jewish birth register of the village .
further research led them to strauss ’ home where he spent his first 18 years with his parents and six siblings .
born in buttenheim on february 26 , 1829 , strauss was the son of a jewish salesman , who sold his wares of scarves and other assorted items from door to door and just about managed to sustain his nine-member family .
after the death of his father in 1846 , strauss ’ mother decided to emigrate to america the following year with her three youngest children .
that ’ s where levi strauss invented his iconic blue jeans and the rest , as they say , is history .
keeping the memory of strauss ’ origins alive but despite catching on late to the legend of levi strauss , the village of buttenheim has been quick to capitalise on the global popularity of their most famous citizen .
in 1987 , authorities in buttenheim decided to preserve the memory of their most famous citizen , especially strauss ’ early years spent in their village .
they bought strauss ’ crumbling half-timbered family house , painstakingly restored it and turned it into a museum two years ago dedicated to the life and invention of löb strauss as he was originally known .
this week the levi strauss museum jeans & cult in the idyllic buttenheim quietly remembers the 100th birth anniversary of the legendary inventor whose name is almost synonymous with jeans today .
visitors to the museum can get a peep into the life of levi strauss from the time of his birth to his emigration to america on the ground floor of the former strauss residence with the help of graphics , photo documentation and audio material .
die-hard levis-wearers can educate themselves on the origins of their beloved jeans on a floor dedicated to the world of denim and indigo .
right from strauss ’ early creations of sturdy riveted workpants guaranteed to withstand the most arduous strain to his flagship levi ’ s 501 jeans stitched in 1890 , the visitor can get a feel of how the world ’ s most famous jeans came into being .
besides levis jeans , the strauss museum in buttenheim also provides insights into the development of the general denim industry and the techniques involved in dying and treating the material .
undoubtedly the highlight of the exhibition is the " original jeans " from 1890 , the legendary 501 from a private collection .
mecca for levis fans much like elvis presley ’ s house in graceland , the modest museum in buttenheim has become a mecca for the world-wide levis fan-group .

but what isn ’ t is the fact that levi strauss was born in southern germany .
a museum in his birth-place hopes to change that . the stories of the birth of the quintessentially american blue jeans have achieved an almost myth-like status .
from the heady days of the california gold rush of 1849 to levi strauss ’ move to the wild west armed with a supply of canvas , needles , thread and scissors .
from strauss ' search for the perfect sturdy overalls for the miners labouring in the gold mines to the creation of the first riveted pants made of serge de nimes or denim - the legends of ruggedness and innovation have come to embody the american dream .
tracing levi strauss to southern germany but few know that the man behind the world ’ s most famous jeans was born on the other side of the atlantic - in a village in southern germany between the cities of bamberg and nuremberg .
not even the 3,000 inhabitants of upper-franconian buttenheim , knew that their village could lay claim to such a famous son till almost 20 years ago .
in 1983 historians stumbled upon levi strauss ’ name in the jewish birth register of the village .
further research led them to strauss ’ home where he spent his first 18 years with his parents and six siblings .
born in buttenheim on february 26 , 1829 , strauss was the son of a jewish salesman , who sold his wares of scarves and other assorted items from door to door and just about managed to sustain his nine-member family .
after the death of his father in 1846 , strauss ’ mother decided to emigrate to america the following year with her three youngest children .
that ’ s where levi strauss invented his iconic blue jeans and the rest , as they say , is history .
keeping the memory of strauss ’ origins alive but despite catching on late to the legend of levi strauss , the village of buttenheim has been quick to capitalise on the global popularity of their most famous citizen .
in 1987 , authorities in buttenheim decided to preserve the memory of their most famous citizen , especially strauss ’ early years spent in their village .
they bought strauss ’ crumbling half-timbered family house , painstakingly restored it and turned it into a museum two years ago dedicated to the life and invention of löb strauss as he was originally known .
this week the levi strauss museum jeans & cult in the idyllic buttenheim quietly remembers the 100th birth anniversary of the legendary inventor whose name is almost synonymous with jeans today .
visitors to the museum can get a peep into the life of levi strauss from the time of his birth to his emigration to america on the ground floor of the former strauss residence with the help of graphics , photo documentation and audio material .
die-hard levis-wearers can educate themselves on the origins of their beloved jeans on a floor dedicated to the world of denim and indigo .
right from strauss ’ early creations of sturdy riveted workpants guaranteed to withstand the most arduous strain to his flagship levi ’ s 501 jeans stitched in 1890 , the visitor can get a feel of how the world ’ s most famous jeans came into being .
besides levis jeans , the strauss museum in buttenheim also provides insights into the development of the general denim industry and the techniques involved in dying and treating the material .
undoubtedly the highlight of the exhibition is the " original jeans " from 1890 , the legendary 501 from a private collection .

the move draws sharp critique from countries in compliance . with europe ’ s largest economies in a deficit bind , the european commission passed a policy delaying a balanced budget deadline and giving members two extra years , until 2006 , to balance their books .
the tuesday decision by the eu ’ s administrative and executive arm brought relief to germany , italy , portugal and france , all of whom are either in the process of , or already violating the eu ’ s stability pact rule that budget deficits can be only 3 percent of the country ’ s gross domestic product .
the decision drew criticism from countries belgium , spain and the netherlands , all of whom have taken domestically unpopular steps to reduce deficits .
“ if next year or in 2004 the german , italian or french budgets should again veer away from an equilbirium , i think we would not only put at risk the pact but the legitimate confidence of investors and consumers in the evolution of the european union , ” said beligan finance minister didier reynders in a radio interview .
europe 's strongest and its weakest the three countries make up both europe ’ s biggest economies and its biggest debtors .
the german ecnonomy , in particular , has been hedging dangerously close to the 3 percent limit set by the growth and stability pact – which the germans helped shape in the mid-1990s .
on tuesday , german finance minister hans eichel , fresh off an ebullient nail-biting victory by his social democratic party in sunday ’ s elections , reported soberly to the commission that german debt would reach 2.9 percent of the gdp this year .
the number was 0.4 percent higher than the mark set earlier by the finance ministry .
eichel has promised to continue on the strict savings program he initiated during chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s first term .
but economists say saving is not enough .
germany ’ s needs deep structural reforms to its economy .
europe ’ s economies in a downward spiral the refrain has been one that has resounded across the european union with the rise of the globalized economy .
at the moment , the european union is finding itself facing a harsh economic reality .
the slumping world economy has prompted european economies to increase spending to provide stimulus .
but spending only contributes to sluggish growth , according to a scathing report tuesday by eu monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes .
as a result , the eu economies would only grow by a combined 1 percent in the coming year , 0.4 percent less than forecast .
now , the country ’ s economies have until 2006 to sort out their problems , two years later than the original balanced budget deadline envisioned .
but to keep major economies like germany ’ s on guard , the commission announced it expected budget deficits to go down 0.5 percent each year .
delaying deadline could spark growth the decision was greeted by the head of germany ’ s insitute for economic research . ” i see it as a must in order to save the stability pact , ” klaus zimmerman told reuters .
had the eu stuck to the pact ’ s deadline , numerous economies would have missed the mark .
the eu would then have faced a loss of faith in the growth and stability pact , zimmerman said .
he also expects the decision to give a much needed growth boost to europe ’ s economies , including germany ’ s . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

rescuers have recovered the bodies of 300 people and about 100 survivors have been picked up , from almost 800 passengers on board the vessel .
-lrb- the joola -rrb- should never have taken to the sea sud newspaper there is little hope of finding more survivors , rescue workers say .
senegalese president abdoulaye wade has said the state bears responsibility for thursday night 's accident .
facing angry crowds in the capital , dakar , he said he believed there had been " an accumulation of errors , " which resulted in the state-run ferry capsizing .
overloaded ship mr wade said it had been established that the ship was overloaded - and the state would compensate the victims ' families .
the ferry , named the joola , was travelling from ziguinchor , the main town of the southern senegalese province of casamance , to dakar when the tragedy occurred .
it was carrying 796 passengers , although it had a capacity of just 550 .
mr wade said , people had been allowed on without tickets .
" -lrb- the boat -rrb- was too high in the water , too slow . "
questions have also been raised about maintenance , as the joola had only recently resumed service after undergoing repairs .
jean-marie diatta , anxiously waiting for news of his relatives at the quayside , told the bbc he blamed the tragedy on negligence .
he said an earlier sailing from ziguinchor had also experienced problems , with one of the ship 's motors damaged in a storm .
" when that damage became clear , the ship should have been put out of commission , " said mr diatta .
" what we are seeing now is the result of irresponsibility . "
media outrage senegal 's independent press has also been strongly critical of the government .
relatives of the victims are furious " criminal negligence , " the sud daily newspaper declared in a front-page headline .
the joola " should never have taken to the sea , " it said .
the walfadjri newspaper said the tragedy had been caused by " negligence " and " technical failings " affecting the engines - and it condemned the government 's decision to return the joola to service as " criminal populism " .
most of those missing are senegalese nationals , along with a number of foreigners from neighbouring guinea-bissau and gambia - as well as french , spanish and swiss nationals .
scores of bodies - many of them children - are reported to have been recovered from the river gambia and transported to the gambian capital , banjul .
the government has declared three days of national mourning .
' it was terrible ' survivors said disaster struck in a matter of minutes .
distraught relatives crowded the quayside in dakar " everything happened so quickly .
the boat overturned in less than five minutes , " said moulay badgi .
" i heard the crying of the children and it was terrible . "
survivors stayed on top of the capsized boat for two hours , until fishing boats arrived to pluck them off .
" it was horrible , because we were hearing people screaming from underneath , " said another survivor , moussa ndong .
" i survived , but i saw my wife drown and i could do nothing to help , " said frenchman patrice auvray , who was taken to hospital in gambia .

the film can be seen on the cafod -lrb- catholic agency for overseas development -rrb- website and is intended to highlight the devastating effect eu farm subsidies can have on the developing world .
according to the charity , eu governments spend enough money on the common agricultural policy every year to fly all their 21 million dairy cows around the world .
by comparison , dairy production in jamaica has collapsed due to the dumping of eu skimmed milk powder , cafod said .
rich cows the website animation shows the lucky herbivores stopping off in a series of exotic locations , including hong kong , brisbane , raratonga and los angeles , and being given £ 400 spending money each .
" the e-animation is a funny way of looking at the eu .
unfortunately the reality is not so humorous , " said cafod campaigner sam goddard .
" the support that eu governments give to the dairy industry - £ 11bn a year - means that the average european dairy cow has a yearly income of more than half the world 's population , " she said .
at the end of the film , surfers are asked to send a postcard to the european commission calling for a cut to eu farm subsidies and the introduction of measures to protect farmers in the developing world .
