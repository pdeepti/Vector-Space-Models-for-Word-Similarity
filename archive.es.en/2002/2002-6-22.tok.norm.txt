speaking in an exclusive bbc interview , general musharraf said the two countries had come " very close " to war - although the threat had diminished because intentions had changed .
but he said the capability for fighting remained .
musharraf has called for high-level talks with india " the situation will remain explosive because if anything happens in kashmir or inside india , which is a possibility by any independent group or terrorist organisation , the situation could become explosive again , " he said .
president musharraf , who wore a grey suit and tie rather than his military uniform , said the only way to lower tensions was to reduce the military forces .
and he said he believed it would be best to have a dialogue at the highest level , with indian prime minister atal behari vajpayee - and the foreign ministers could meet first to prepare the ground if the indians wanted .
stalemate at present there appears to be a deadlock between india and pakistan .
the indian defence minister george fernandes said he believed infiltration across the dividing line of control from pakistan had almost ended .
but dialogue with pakistan was not possible until infiltration was permanently stopped , he said .
this was a key demand by india and was supported by the united states and other western countries - although pakistan maintained it only provided moral and diplomatic support to the fighters .
kashmir is in the limelight and this is the best way of moving forward to a peaceful resolution of the dispute president musharraf general musharraf said it was not a mistake to back the militants and he did not believe it had damaged pakistan .
" i think the world knows the reality , the kashmir cause is understood by the whole world , it was never discussed or considered seriously , " he said .
" kashmir is in the limelight and this is the best way of moving forward to a peaceful resolution of the dispute . "
al-qaeda presence investigations are continuing in pakistan into the series of attacks aimed at foreigners which include two recent bombs in karachi .
president musharraf said it was possible that osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network was involved - but it said it could also be india or any terrorist organisation that opposed pakistan and the united states .
he said they had arrested more than 300 al-qaeda suspects from the border areas with afghanistan and from the cities .
" the possibility of more being there can not be ruled out and we are taking action , we need information and intelligence support and whenever we get it we move very fast and very effectively . "
he said the al-qaeda members were in small groups spread over pakistan but he was sure the authorities would keep moving against them .
will keep ' overwatch ' on the question of october 's parliamentary elections , he said he would ensure they would be fair and would invite any observers to come and see what it happening , but was sure the losers would complain .
" we cry when we lose - that will happen everytime , " he said .
" i know people will talk against it . "
many analysts have questioned whether the elections will restore true democracy .
president musharraf , who won another five years in office in a controversial referendum earlier this year , has already spoken of continuing with checks and balances .
he said that after the elections the prime minister would be all-powerful and could take decisions on everything .
pakistan is not a bed of roses president musharraf but he said he would retain the authority to have an " overwatch " and have the power to dismiss the cabinet or assembly , through a national security council .
" i am giving up power and not usurping power - that is how i see it and i mean every word of it , " he said .

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- top gamers seek cash to compete news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : science / nature news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk saturday , 22 june , 2002 , 08:02 gmt 09:02 uk top gamers seek cash to compete some parts of castle wolfenstein emphasise stealth one of britain 's top online gaming groups , known as a clan , is seeking sponsorship to help it attend a prestigious tournament in the us .
although many european clans have managed to get sponsorship to cover travel and basic gaming costs , few uk-based clans have managed to secure similar backing .
the four-kings -lrb- 4k -rrb- clan is sending out e-mail messages to prospective sponsors to see if they can help contribute to the costs of sending six of its members to the tournament in texas .
if the clan makes it to the tournament and does well they could come home with $ 25,000 in prize money .
game on toby aldridge , captain of the four-kings clan , said it needed about £ 4500 to attend the quakecon conference being held in mesquite , texas from 15-18 august .
gaining any kind of sponsorship in the uk is basically impossible james mccarthy , iron fist the 4k clan is hoping to take the honours playing the return to castle wolfenstein game .
although many gaming websites run online tournaments and divisional competitions that let clans find out who is the best , it is usually the real world tournaments that confer the biggest prestige and , more importantly , prize money .
many of these competitions are invitation only and clans only get asked to attend if they have done well in site-based or national leagues .
as a result , the top clans are keen to attend these tournaments but it can prove expensive to go to them all .
unfortunately online gaming in the uk is still seen as , at best , a boy 's hobby rather than something potentially lucrative or even worthwhile .
" gaining any kind of sponsorship in the uk is basically impossible , " said james mccarthy , aka anarchy of quake clan iron fist .
he said four members of iron fist recently attended the cyberathlete professional league tournament in cologne and paid about £ 400 each to get there and play .
" that is n't too expensive as a one-off , " he said .
" but i doubt we could maintain that , as in attend every possible event , without some kind of sponsorship backing especially any competitions that are held in the usa . "
skin game toby aldridge said that gaming is taken much more seriously on the continent .
the realistic look of wolfenstein has boosted its popularity " germany takes sponsorship very seriously , " he said .
" most of the top clans there have multiple sponsors for travel and free hardware . "
clan running costs can be offset slightly by the rewards for winning online tournaments but many british clans need cash to help them keep up with their european counterparts .
toby aldridge said if 4k won sponsorship its members would be happy to wear t-shirts emblazoned with the sponsor 's name and even change the name of the clan to include that of the sponsor .

strathclyde police want to classify information gained in inquiries into complaints against officers as confidential .
the force 's joint police board has made a formal request to the scottish executive asking for legislation making the contents of internal investigations confidential .
freedom of information campaigners described the plans as " draconian " and said that such a blanket exemption is open to abuse .
the proposals by strathclyde joint police board seek " legislation conferring on reports submitted by investigating officers ... a statutory confidentiality thus ensuring that the content of such reports were not obliged to be produced either to an administrative tribunal or to a court " .
the board has asked the scottish executive to consider whether that " in order to maintain the integrity of the investigation process , a form of statutory confidentiality should be accorded to investigating officer 's reports , in respect of both senior officers and all other ranks " .
police say that the move will protect the confidentiality of witness statements in cases brought against all serving officers .
but civil liberties campaigners are worried by the proposals .
confidential status david goldberg of the scottish campaign for freedom of information said that such blanket confidentiality always rings " alarm bells " .
he said that there should be tests to determine the criteria under which a document or report attracts confidential status .
a report should only be confidential if there could be substantial harm caused by its release or if it was against the public interest to make the document available , he said .
amnesty international also expressed concern at the proposals .
spokesman neil durkin said : " amnesty international would be concerned at any measures that obstruct openness and full transparency into necessary investigations into alleged wrongdoing . "
disciplinary matters he added that public confidence would be eroded by secrecy .
a spokeswoman for strathclyde police said the recommendations had been submitted " to protect the privacy of voluntary statements given in disciplinary matters " .
the scottish executive said it had received the proposals .
it said ministers will consider their response and a white paper on dealing with complaints against the police will be published at the end of the year .

but thousands of people who booked flights to india and pakistan , before the government advised against travelling there , have found getting a refund is not easy .
this week money box spoke to lizzie , a young person from gloucestershire , who planned to backpack around india with a friend .
as the situation in kashmir took a turn for the worse , the pair realised they would have to cancel their trip .
unable to claim on insurance. they approached gulfair to attempt to get back the £ 440 pounds each they had paid for their tickets .
they were angry to discover they would have to pay a cancellation fee of a £ 100 pounds .
but they are better off than many .
compensation policies moneybox contacted all the major airlines flying to the region , and found very different policies on compensation .
british airways and virgin for example , will not give most passengers any money back at all .
instead they will fly customers to an alternative destination , allow them to postpone or give them travel vouchers .
on the other hand pakistan international airlines will give a full refund .
independent travel editor simon calder says many people will feel they can not afford to lose their ticket price and will fly anyway , at great personal risk .
he told the programme : " i think a lot of people when they look at the cancellation penalities for their ticket will say just think ' i 've paid a 500 , 700 , £ 1000 pounds , i will go anyway . '
travel insurance that could have serious implications for their travel insurance because many policies are invalidated when you go against foreign office advice . "
lizzie and her friend reluctantly decided to cancel their trip after their agent dropped their share of the cancellation fee , but she is still out of pocket and told moneybox : " the reason why we are both very angry is that we have not done anything wrong and we are being charged £ 50 pounds each for following government advice . "
european strikes for people whose holidays may be disrupted by strike action in europe this summer the situation is almost exactly the same .
it is down to the goodwill of the airlines whether they will offer you compensation or fly you somewhere else .
as for travel insurance , if you booked your ticket before the 17 june then you can claim .
but if you booked your holiday after that date , the claim will not be valid as the insurers say the strikes became public knowledge so it is just a risk you are taking . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's louise greenwood " there are very different policies on compensation " home listen to money box money box phone-in archive guides & calculators meet the team contact us your money a round up of the latest finance stories from bbc business news from bbc business news the markets : 9:29 uk ftse 100 5760.40 -151.7 dow jones 11380.99 -119.7 nasdaq 2243.78 -28.9 ftse delayed by 15 mins , dow and nasdaq by 20 mins see also : 14 jun 02 -pipe- business tense times for india tour firms 07 jun 02 -pipe- south asia britons in india face dilemma 02 jun 02 -pipe- uk politics ' no plans ' to airlift britons from india 01 jun 02 -pipe- uk politics kashmir warning a ' precaution ' - straw 31 may 02 -pipe- uk politics britons warned off india internet links : association of british travel agents foreign office india tourist office the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top moneybox stories now : money box returns sitting on a fortune updates by e-mail links to more moneybox stories are at the foot of the page .

' timely ' the report said other countries which have put their mapping agencies on a more commercial footing have seen the quality of maps decline .
a spokesman for the office of the deputy prime minister , which is responsible for ordance survey , said : " the government welcomes this timely report and will take account of and carefully consider all the conclusions the committee has reached . "

a number of mortgage providers introduced a dual rate system in 2001 but the ombudsman ruled that c & g had acted unfairly to some borrowers and should pay compensation .
money box has been gathering more information about what happens next .
exactly who is in line to get money back ?
at this point only a couple of hundred customers can expect compensation .
it will average four to five hundred pounds .
this will account for ' overpayments ' in their monthly mortgage for a few months in 2001 .
the affected people were either on discounted or capped c & g mortgages and were either refused permission to move to a lower rate or were only allowed to do so if they paid a redemption penalty .
they will also have registered a complaint with c & g between 30 april and 10 september 2001 - the time this system was operated .
do people need to claim or contact c & g again now ?
c & g says people need not do anything .
it is identifying everyone in this position and should have written to them within a fortnight saying what it will do and what it will pay .
and what if you did not complain , or did not realise you could have complained , until after 10 september last year ?
that is to yet to be tested .
there is another case with the ombudsman involving someone who complained after 10 september 2001 .
if c & g lose , hundreds of thousands of c & g borrowers on the standard variable mortgage rate would have a case for compensation even if they no complaint is lodged before the case is decided .
but c & g may not lose that case or , if it did , it might appeal .
c & g 's advice to customers is ' wait and see ' but people can talk to staff at branches or call the national customer inquiry number open office hours monday to friday and until 1300hrs on saturdays .

the israeli defence force 's incursions in west bank towns were approved by the cabinet on friday .
the offensive is a response to palestinian suicide bombings in jerusalem and an attack on the jewish settlement of itamar in the west bank which have killed 36 israelis in the past week .
the israeli daily haaretz said the new policy was a compromise between prime minister ariel sharon 's proposal that the idf remain in the towns " for a prolonged period of time " and defence minister benjamin ben-eliezer 's position that the operation should be limited to the period needed to achieve results .
jenin ' mistake ' the army has admitted that it accidentally opened fire on a crowded market in the west bank town of jenin , killing at least three palestinian civilians .
but it stopped short of making an apology .
palestinian hospital sources said five people were killed , including three young children , and many others were injured .
it seems the people in jenin mistakenly thought the curfew had been lifted and were rushing out to stock up on food supplies .
an army spokesman said troops in jenin had fired a number of tank shells to scare off a crowd that had broken the curfew .
" as a result of the shooting three palestinians were killed and 10 others were wounded .
an initial inquiry indicates that the force erred in its action , " the israeli army said .
further inquiries are being carried out , the army said .
the palestinians say that at least two tank shells were fired into the crowded fruit and vegetable market .
the israelis are also said to have used a heavy machine gun .
funeral violence violence also broke out after the funerals of five jewish settlers - including three children and their mother - who were killed near the west bank town of nablus on thursday night .
mourners are reported to have gone on the rampage through an arab village , firing guns and setting cars alight .
one palestinian man is said to have been killed .
israeli troops and tanks moved in force into nablus , a few hours after the killings .
in the gaza strip , three palestinians were shot dead by israeli border guards near a crossing point , and a young palestinian boy was killed by israeli tank fire .
also in the gaza strip , one israeli was wounded in a shooting incident at the netzarim jewish settlement .
