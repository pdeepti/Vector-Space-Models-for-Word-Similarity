heart disease is the number one killer in britain , claiming the lives of one in four men and one in six women .
people with significant heart disease should be entitled to see a specialist in cardiac medicine at some time during the course of their problems professor john camm among developed countries , only ireland and finland have a worse record .
the british cardiac society and the royal college of physicians have joined forces to examine the state of coronary heart disease care nine years on from a similar exercise .
the report recognises important advances have been made in the organisation and funding of cardiovascular care .
it says there have been major improvements in a number of clinical areas , such as restabilising the blood flow to the heart and dissolving blood clots .
uk heart operations -lrb- year to march 2000 -rrb- bypass surgery 24,728 -lrb- 2.2 % death rate -rrb- valve surgery 5,394 -lrb- 5.5 % -rrb- bypass and valve surgery 2,641 -lrb- 7.8 % -rrb- operations for ischaemic heart disease 462 -lrb- 17.1 % -rrb- and health professionals involved in the care of heart patients - including gps - have begun to work together more closely to provide more integrated care .
however , the report says there are still major concerns , and makes a number of recommendations aimed at improving the situation .
it says that the government 's national service framework for coronary heart disease needs to be implemented more consistently throughout the uk to put an end to big regional variations in the quality of care .
other conditions it warns that the framework has led to an over-emphasis on coronary heart disease at the expense of other heart problems .
and it says a greater focus is needed on conditions such as complex heart rhythm problems , heart muscle and valve disease , and congenital disease in both children and adults .
the report also recommends : patients are given a greater say in planning of services an increase in specialist staff to maximise the number of patients who are seen by people with expertise in the field an extra 1,500 consultant cardiologists by 2010 an upgrade of it a major reorganisation of working practices to include assessment of the feasibility of using ancillary staff such as surgeon and physician assistants professor john camm , president of the british cardiac society , told bbc news online : " there has been a good deal of improvement since the national service framework , but we are still currently behind most of the other developed countries in europe , and far behind the us . "
professor camm said that the us , which has a population roughly four times that of the uk , has 24,000 cardiologists .
in the uk the figure is 630 .
" without basic manpower the service simply can not be provided to the level that it ought .
" people with significant heart disease should be entitled to see a specialist in cardiac medicine at some time during the course of their problems .
at present , only about a third do .
" an expert in general medicine will provide the best care that he or she can , and the patient may be unaware of the difference .
" but cardiologists tend to be much more knowledgeable about the field , and to be more aggressive in their treatment strategies . " watch / listen on this story the bbc 's karen allen " britain lags behind its european neighbours " the bbc 's sharon allcock " while a lot of money and effort has gone into treating heart disease it 's not enough " the report chairman responds to a patient 's mother " we have about half the number of cardiologists we need " see also : 05 apr 01 -pipe- health heart care ' biased against women ' 19 feb 02 -pipe- health uk heart care lagging behind 19 nov 01 -pipe- health heart patients ' face hospital lottery ' internet links : british heart foundation national heart forum royal college of physicians british cardiac society the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top health stories now : heart risk link to big families back pain drug ' may aid diabetics ' congo ebola outbreak confirmed vegetables ward off alzheimer 's polio campaign launched in iraq gene defect explains high blood pressure botox ' may cause new wrinkles ' alien ' abductees ' show real symptoms links to more health stories are at the foot of the page .

figures from the national bureau of statistics -lrb- nbs -rrb- indicated that asia 's second largest economy would beat its 7 % target for the whole year as exports surged 19.4 % in the period . "
the state policies of expanding domestic demand and market demand have become the two major driving forces of economic development " nbs " the national economy has maintained fast and healthy growth and momentum and the overall situation is better than expected , " the bureau said .
the data comes ahead of next month 's communist party congress , at which china 's leadership , including president jiang zemin are expected to hand over power to a new generation .
pump priming government spending helped push growth to 8.1 % year-on-year in the july to september quarter alone .
" the state policies of expanding domestic demand and market demand have become the two major driving forces of economic development , " an nbs spokesman said .
infrastructure investment - on roads , property and power grids - rose 21.8 % in the nine months to september from last year .
the government hopes the fiscal stimulus will create jobs and lay the building blocks for further economic growth .
the evolving private sector has been absorbing unemployed former public sector workers and china could attract $ 55bn in foreign direct investment this year , the nbs said .
prices fall stalking the chinese economy is deflation , with consumer prices falling 0.8 % over the nine months , which can hurt company profits and lead to lower investment .
the lower prices helped retail sales up 8.7 % in the period , but were not enough to help them reach the government target of 9 % .
china 's deflation has been blamed on industrial overcapacity and weak demand from consumers , who fearing unemployment , are saving their cash as the country goes through major economic changes .
industrial production rose by 12.2 % .

most of the boys end up in the national army where 70,000 soldiers are estimated to be under the age of 18 , though armed opposition groups use them as well , according to the report .
jo becker of human rights watch said : " to be a boy in myanmar today means facing the constant risk of being picked up off the street , forced to commit atrocities against villagers , and never seeing family again . "

" the government finds it very difficult to understand on what basis it is making such claims , saying that 20 % of the national army is made up of underage children , " it said in a statement .
human rights watch said its researchers held extensive interviews with current and former child soldiers and examined recruitment by the national army and 19 different armed opposition groups to compile the report .

the study suggested that only a quarter of all deaths led to the employer being taken to court - compared to a third in england and wales .
and the centre for corporate accountability -lrb- cca -rrb- also said that the average fines for workplace deaths were significantly lower than in the rest of britain .
david bergman : " a lack of deterrent " the report , which was produced in conjunction with the union unison , was exclusively obtained by bbc scotland 's frontline programme .
the cca campaigns for employers to be held accountable when they breach safety laws .
director david bergman said its latest research had shown a higher level of death and injury among the scottish workforce than in the rest of the uk .
over the last two years 62 people have been killed at work north of the border .
" there 's clearly a problem .
in scotland more people are dying , more people are being injured at work than in other parts of the country , " he said .
death and injury " in addition to that our research shows that there is a very low prosecution rate following investigation into these deaths and major injuries .
" and that will result in a lack of deterrent that filters through the system allowing employers to feel that they can cause death and injury through reckless or negligent operation of their activities and escape accountability .
" they can get away with it and , clearly , that is going to result in more deaths and more injuries taking place . "
bill gilchrist could not explain the difference the report said that prosecutions followed a quarter of workplace deaths north of the border , compared to a third in england and wales .
deputy crown agent bill gilchrist said he did not know why there was such a gap .
he suggested that the different standard of evidence required in the scottish court system may be one of the explanations .
mr gilchrist said : " we have a policy to prosecute where there is sufficient evidence and , if you want an explanation for a difference , you would have to look at individual cases .
" you wo n't get the answer from the statistics . "
' low level of fines ' the cca said its research had also shown that fines imposed in scotland after a successful prosecution were " extremely low " compared to england and wales .
" in the rest of britain the average fine was about £ 60,000 per death , not a very large sum of money anyway , " said mr bergman .
" in scotland it was £ 7,000 on average , a very low level of fine .

" glastonbury " was written by zoe lewis and revolves around the funny and disturbing experiences of seven different people meeting and partying - set against hirst 's colourful stage set .
performed in a marquee at cardiff 's bute park , the play stars allen , kieran o 'brien -lrb- cracker , messiah -rrb- , chris coghill -lrb- ' bez ' in 24 hour party people -rrb- , bronwyn davies -lrb- spooks -rrb- and paul broughton .
keith allen : glastonbury veteran hirst 's art features multi-coloured tents , crowd scenes and an intriguing image of revellers climbing a perimeter fence , with their faces blanked out - a controversial nod to security troubles at the 2001 festival which threatened glastonbury 's very future .
hirst said : " it is a bit like doing a book that you are illustrating , which is something in its own right .
" but there is no point doing a book without a story .
" i thought there was a great story here and i thought i will go with it . "
allen - a self-confessed glastonbury veteran of 22 visits - said he wanted to bring some excitement and mystery back into theatre , with each performance featuring a surprise appearance by a rock band to bring the glastonbury spirit alive .
new order , ub40 and ocean colour scene are believed to be among the bands taking part in the project .
glasto atmosphere lewis , who worked in the music business before turning to drama , is also hopeful that her play will draw younger people back to the theatre in search of something different .
the dramatist wants to confront audiences with something special and different to conventional plays , with the live music element , stalls and campfires , tipping the play towards feeling like a realistic festival atmosphere .
glastonbury attracts all sorts of folk allen said : " i think damien hirst has done a brilliant job designing the sets .
it 's something he 's always wanted to do .
" i think the tradition of going to see live shows is dying , " he said .
" a lot of the -lsb- theatre -rsb- fare people are offered is pretty mundane and pretty boring . "
glastonbury has been bought as a film project by working title productions .
the play features typical scenes from the festival , including two revellers trying to sneak in and being caught by a security guard .
glastonbury will be moving to london 's roundhouse theatre next spring after a short tour including brighton , manchester and birmingham .
