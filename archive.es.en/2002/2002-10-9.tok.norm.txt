on monday the company was forced to face up to its wartime past after revelations surrounding the publisher ’ s activities surfaced in a 794-page report by the independent historical commission -lrb- ihc -rrb- , which had been called upon to investigate the company ’ s link to the nazis .
the ihc 's investigation uncovered contradictions in the company 's version of its wartime activities , as well as some unknown details that have now been exposed .
bertelsmann thrived under nazis the commission 's investigations showed that bertelsmann did not resist hitler and the third reich as previously reported by the company in its corporate reports , but instead thrived during world war ii by producing anti-semitic material and nazi propaganda .
according to the ihc report , the traditional family-run publishing house was motivated by financial profits to take on several printing contracts given by the nazi government .
within just a few years , bertelsmann grew to become the largest book producer for the german army during the war , publishing some 19 million editions .
most of the publications were brochures and pamphlets intended to strengthen the morale and courage of soldiers on the front , but many of the works also contained extreme derogatory texts about foreigners and jews .
in addition , the ihc study reveals that although bertelsmann itself was not directly involved in employing nazi slave labourers , several of the company ’ s printing houses in vilnius , lithuania , relied on cheap jewish labourers from the local ghetto to run their presses .
the commission also adds that it is very likely that nazi slave labourers were used in associated printing houses in riga , latvia .
end of a company legend until the historical commission began investigating the company ’ s history in the late 1990s , bertelsmann had always maintained its historically active role in the nazi resistance .
from 1945 on , the christian-based company claimed it had been shut down by the nazis for anti-government tendencies .
but the commission ’ s report indicates that this was a mere " legend " that had been invented by the company in order to receive a publishing license from the occupying forces as quickly as possible .
in reality , bertelsmann was closed in 1944 because it was found guilty of hoarding paper and could no longer turn a good profit .
official historical record " bertelsmann ag unreservedly accepts the independent historical commission 's report as the official record of the company 's history during the third reich , " said bertelsmann 's chief operating officer günter thielen in an official statement on the company 's web site .
" i would like to express our sincere regret for the inaccuracies the commission has uncovered in our previous corporate history of the world war ii era , as well as for the wartime activities that have been brought to light , " thielen said .
the independent historical commission , a group of four scholars , headed by university of california historian saul friedlander , worked on the report for over three years , painstakingly researching and documenting the company ’ s history under the nazi regime .
the commission was called upon by bertelsmann to investigate the company ’ s wartime era history following the publication of an article entitled " bertelsmann 's nazi past " which appeared in the nation magazine in december 1998 .
throughout the investigation , the scholars had full access to the bertelsmann company archives as well as contact to historical witnesses such as reinhard mohn , the son of heinrich mohn , the company ’ s director during the third reich .
corporate archive open to public referring to the ihc 's investigation , thielen said , " this experience has reinforced for us why historical accuracy and transparency must be an integral part of our company ’ s core values , and we hope to serve as an example to other companies about the importance of this . "
" this has also shown us how , as one of the largest media companies in the world , we have a special responsibility to promote openness and public debate on these issues , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bertelsmann headquarters in gütersloh , germany , will be home to the commission 's evidence .
as a result of the ihc ’ s findings , thielen said that bertelsmann will now open an interim corporate archive on october 8th where the complete archives of the company 's corporate history will be open to the public .
the archive will be managed by a team of professional historians until march 31st , 2003 when the archives will be transferred to the bertelsmann foundation headquarters in gütersloh , where they will remain available to the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bertelsmann restructures thomas middelhoff ’ s successor at bertelsmann is a loyal company man who enjoys the type of trust from the influential mohn family middelhoff never did .

on monday the company was forced to face up to its wartime past after revelations surrounding the publisher ’ s activities surfaced in a 794-page report by the independent historical commission -lrb- ihc -rrb- , which had been called upon to investigate the company ’ s link to the nazis .
the ihc 's investigation uncovered contradictions in the company 's version of its wartime activities , as well as some unknown details that have now been exposed .
bertelsmann thrived under nazis the commission 's investigations showed that bertelsmann did not resist hitler and the third reich as previously reported by the company in its corporate reports , but instead thrived during world war ii by producing anti-semitic material and nazi propaganda .
according to the ihc report , the traditional family-run publishing house was motivated by financial profits to take on several printing contracts given by the nazi government .
within just a few years , bertelsmann grew to become the largest book producer for the german army during the war , publishing some 19 million editions .
most of the publications were brochures and pamphlets intended to strengthen the morale and courage of soldiers on the front , but many of the works also contained extreme derogatory texts about foreigners and jews .
in addition , the ihc study reveals that although bertelsmann itself was not directly involved in employing nazi slave labourers , several of the company ’ s printing houses in vilnius , lithuania , relied on cheap jewish labourers from the local ghetto to run their presses .
the commission also adds that it is very likely that nazi slave labourers were used in associated printing houses in riga , latvia .
end of a company legend until the historical commission began investigating the company ’ s history in the late 1990s , bertelsmann had always maintained its historically active role in the nazi resistance .
from 1945 on , the christian-based company claimed it had been shut down by the nazis for anti-government tendencies .
but the commission ’ s report indicates that this was a mere " legend " that had been invented by the company in order to receive a publishing license from the occupying forces as quickly as possible .
in reality , bertelsmann was closed in 1944 because it was found guilty of hoarding paper and could no longer turn a good profit .
official historical record " bertelsmann ag unreservedly accepts the independent historical commission 's report as the official record of the company 's history during the third reich , " said bertelsmann 's chief operating officer günter thielen in an official statement on the company 's web site .
" i would like to express our sincere regret for the inaccuracies the commission has uncovered in our previous corporate history of the world war ii era , as well as for the wartime activities that have been brought to light , " thielen said .

on monday the company was forced to face up to its wartime past after revelations surrounding the publisher ’ s activities surfaced in a 794-page report by the independent historical commission -lrb- ihc -rrb- , which had been called upon to investigate the company ’ s link to the nazis .
the ihc 's investigation uncovered contradictions in the company 's version of its wartime activities , as well as some unknown details that have now been exposed .
bertelsmann thrived under nazis the commission 's investigations showed that bertelsmann did not resist hitler and the third reich as previously reported by the company in its corporate reports , but instead thrived during world war ii by producing anti-semitic material and nazi propaganda .
according to the ihc report , the traditional family-run publishing house was motivated by financial profits to take on several printing contracts given by the nazi government .
within just a few years , bertelsmann grew to become the largest book producer for the german army during the war , publishing some 19 million editions .
most of the publications were brochures and pamphlets intended to strengthen the morale and courage of soldiers on the front , but many of the works also contained extreme derogatory texts about foreigners and jews .
in addition , the ihc study reveals that although bertelsmann itself was not directly involved in employing nazi slave labourers , several of the company ’ s printing houses in vilnius , lithuania , relied on cheap jewish labourers from the local ghetto to run their presses .
the commission also adds that it is very likely that nazi slave labourers were used in associated printing houses in riga , latvia .
end of a company legend until the historical commission began investigating the company ’ s history in the late 1990s , bertelsmann had always maintained its historically active role in the nazi resistance .
from 1945 on , the christian-based company claimed it had been shut down by the nazis for anti-government tendencies .
but the commission ’ s report indicates that this was a mere " legend " that had been invented by the company in order to receive a publishing license from the occupying forces as quickly as possible .
in reality , bertelsmann was closed in 1944 because it was found guilty of hoarding paper and could no longer turn a good profit .
official historical record " bertelsmann ag unreservedly accepts the independent historical commission 's report as the official record of the company 's history during the third reich , " said bertelsmann 's chief operating officer günter thielen in an official statement on the company 's web site .
" i would like to express our sincere regret for the inaccuracies the commission has uncovered in our previous corporate history of the world war ii era , as well as for the wartime activities that have been brought to light , " thielen said .
the independent historical commission , a group of four scholars , headed by university of california historian saul friedlander , worked on the report for over three years , painstakingly researching and documenting the company ’ s history under the nazi regime .
the commission was called upon by bertelsmann to investigate the company ’ s wartime era history following the publication of an article entitled " bertelsmann 's nazi past " which appeared in the nation magazine in december 1998 .
throughout the investigation , the scholars had full access to the bertelsmann company archives as well as contact to historical witnesses such as reinhard mohn , the son of heinrich mohn , the company ’ s director during the third reich .
corporate archive open to public referring to the ihc 's investigation , thielen said , " this experience has reinforced for us why historical accuracy and transparency must be an integral part of our company ’ s core values , and we hope to serve as an example to other companies about the importance of this . "
" this has also shown us how , as one of the largest media companies in the world , we have a special responsibility to promote openness and public debate on these issues , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bertelsmann headquarters in gütersloh , germany , will be home to the commission 's evidence .
as a result of the ihc ’ s findings , thielen said that bertelsmann will now open an interim corporate archive on october 8th where the complete archives of the company 's corporate history will be open to the public .

9 , the world ’ s largest book fair opens in frankfurt .
but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .
and real book enthusiasts , publishers , book sellers and readers , for whom the book is more than just a simple product will again have the say . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the international book fair in frankfurt 2002 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.10.2002 senior citizens keep on surfing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leading by example : german politician edmund stoiber logs on internet chat rooms and late night surfing are no longer the sole domain of the square-eyed younger generation .
senior citizens are taking to the world wide web as the number of ' silver surfers ' soars . the over-50 's are logging on to the internet in surprisingly high numbers , according to a symposium on the ' silver surfer ' phenomenon held at frankfurt university .
the week long symposium , put together by the frankfurt-based senior citizens web site feierabend.com and deutsche telekom , has been organised to discuss the boom in sites aimed at the over-50 's .
it also reveals the increasing numbers who are using the internet for research and entertainment purposes .
in 1995 , three percent of net surfers were older than 50 years of age ; today that number has risen to 20 percent .
estimates suggest that by 2003 , a quarter of all internet surfers will be in the ' silver surfer ' age bracket .
germany is a country with an aging population .
the former christian social union 's minister for family ursula lehr , told the german wires , " we have more people over 60 than under 20 . "
in many areas , this will become problematic in the future , she said .
senior business boom for the specialist pages on the internet catering to senior citizens , that ’ s good news .
with over 4.5 million senior citizens online in germany , businesses are waking up to this previously untapped market .
internet businesses and e-commerce service providers have begun recognizing that senior citizens make for an especially lucrative clientele .
" at the moment , seniors account for a strong consumer sector , " said lehr who is also a certified gerontologist , a scientist that studies the biological , psychological , and sociological phenomena associated with aging .
a study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin shows that most seniors connected to the world wide web are able to spend up to 600 euro per person every month .
because many of them are bound to their homes , shopping online is a popular activity .
about 60 percent of wired seniors have already ordered something over the internet at least once , the study indicates .
special " silver surfer " sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii in the vatican chat room .
the explosion in pages catering to the interests of senior citizens , similar to feierabend.com , proves that there is a market on the internet for leisure time and information sites for the over-50 's .
regular services like news , entertainment and travel sites are all being tailored specifically for this new ' old ' generation of cyber surfers .
and once they are online , most give the pages their undivided attention .

9 , the world ’ s largest book fair opens in frankfurt .
but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .
and real book enthusiasts , publishers , book sellers and readers , for whom the book is more than just a simple product will again have the say . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the international book fair in frankfurt 2002 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the new prices will force spontaneous and business travelers to dig deeper into their pockets . germany 's national railway introduced a new pricing system on wednesday , which deutsche bahn hopes will get more people off the roads , out of the skies and back onto the tracks . “ rail travel for millions of people will cheaper than ever , ” bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn declared at a press conference in berlin . a complex pricing structure currently , rail tickets in germany are priced by distance - approximately 14 cents per kilometer .
nor are there any savings incentives for booking in advance . the system is n't terribly popular with the public , and train travel in germany fell by 4.4 percent in 2002 , according to an interim report released by the company in june .
deutsche bahn is hoping to reverse its fortunes with the new pricing system as well as a much-hyped new high-speed rail line connecting the major hub cities of cologne and frankfurt in just over an hour . the new system , which goes into effect on dec .
15 and is modelled after pricing mechanisms used by the airlines , creates an incentive for passengers to buy their tickets seven days or more in advance by offering them considerible savings if they do . like the airlines , deutsche bahn is betting the system will allow it to better fill empty seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn -lrb- left -rrb- bahn is calling the new system “ clear and transparent . ”
and mehdorn -lrb- photo , left -rrb- believes it is more logical and intuitive than what he describes as the current “ tariff jungle . ” “ at the moment we calculate prices by the kilometer , " deutsche bahn spokesman andreas fuhrmann said . " but it ’ s simply not clear for customers .
they don ’ t have a map by which they can measure the distances out ; it 's not easy to work out which ticket is the best value for thier money .
we want to make things easier for them with this new system . ” winners and losers families will be the biggest winners . children under 14 accompanied by their parents can travel free of charge .
under the old system , this offer only applied to children up to 6 years of age . but for spontaneous or business travelers who require flexibility , travel costs will increase significantly under the new system . travelers who can ’ t book in advance will , in many cases , be punished under the new pricing system . it also deals a heavy blow to holders of the company 's loyalty card , the " bahncard , " which currently entitles customers to a 50-percent discount off the standard fare , even if a ticket is purchased on the day of travel .
the card will continue to exist , but the annual subscription rate will drop to 60 euro -lrb- from the current 140 euro -rrb- and allow consumers to save between 25 percent and 50 percent , depending on how far in advance they book . customers who do not possess the bahncard and are able to plan their journeys in advance will be the biggest winners , reaping savings as high as 40 percent if they book seven days or more ahead , 25 percent three days before travel and 10 percent up to the day before travel . deutsche bahn is also hoping that by reducing the cost of long journeys it can lure customers away from budget air carriers or their cars . journeys of more than 180 kilometers will be up to 27 percent cheaper under the new system .
for example , a ticket between berlin and frankfurt will cost 86.40 euro - 19 percent cheaper than before . critics unimpressed despite support from the german government for its new pricing system , consumer groups are less enthusiastic about deutsche bahn 's new rules . walter hirrlinger , president of vdk , an organisation which represents and cares for war victims and pensioners in germany , called the reforms a " rip-off . "
the new pricing structure would hugely disadvantage the approximately 820,000 chronically sick , disabled and old people in germany who currently posses a bahn card entitling them to a 50 percent fare reduction , he declared in a statement issued on wednesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's super fast train set for take-off germany 's newly completed rail link between cologne and frankfurt could provide the impetus for a europe-wide high-speed rail network .

9 , the world ’ s largest book fair opens in frankfurt .
but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .
and real book enthusiasts , publishers , book sellers and readers , for whom the book is more than just a simple product will again have the say . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the international book fair in frankfurt 2002 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on monday the company was forced to face up to its wartime past after revelations surrounding the publisher ’ s activities surfaced in a 794-page report by the independent historical commission -lrb- ihc -rrb- , which had been called upon to investigate the company ’ s link to the nazis .
the ihc 's investigation uncovered contradictions in the company 's version of its wartime activities , as well as some unknown details that have now been exposed .
bertelsmann thrived under nazis the commission 's investigations showed that bertelsmann did not resist hitler and the third reich as previously reported by the company in its corporate reports , but instead thrived during world war ii by producing anti-semitic material and nazi propaganda .
according to the ihc report , the traditional family-run publishing house was motivated by financial profits to take on several printing contracts given by the nazi government .
within just a few years , bertelsmann grew to become the largest book producer for the german army during the war , publishing some 19 million editions .
most of the publications were brochures and pamphlets intended to strengthen the morale and courage of soldiers on the front , but many of the works also contained extreme derogatory texts about foreigners and jews .
in addition , the ihc study reveals that although bertelsmann itself was not directly involved in employing nazi slave labourers , several of the company ’ s printing houses in vilnius , lithuania , relied on cheap jewish labourers from the local ghetto to run their presses .
the commission also adds that it is very likely that nazi slave labourers were used in associated printing houses in riga , latvia .
end of a company legend until the historical commission began investigating the company ’ s history in the late 1990s , bertelsmann had always maintained its historically active role in the nazi resistance .
from 1945 on , the christian-based company claimed it had been shut down by the nazis for anti-government tendencies .
but the commission ’ s report indicates that this was a mere " legend " that had been invented by the company in order to receive a publishing license from the occupying forces as quickly as possible .
in reality , bertelsmann was closed in 1944 because it was found guilty of hoarding paper and could no longer turn a good profit .
official historical record " bertelsmann ag unreservedly accepts the independent historical commission 's report as the official record of the company 's history during the third reich , " said bertelsmann 's chief operating officer günter thielen in an official statement on the company 's web site .
" i would like to express our sincere regret for the inaccuracies the commission has uncovered in our previous corporate history of the world war ii era , as well as for the wartime activities that have been brought to light , " thielen said .
the independent historical commission , a group of four scholars , headed by university of california historian saul friedlander , worked on the report for over three years , painstakingly researching and documenting the company ’ s history under the nazi regime .
the commission was called upon by bertelsmann to investigate the company ’ s wartime era history following the publication of an article entitled " bertelsmann 's nazi past " which appeared in the nation magazine in december 1998 .
throughout the investigation , the scholars had full access to the bertelsmann company archives as well as contact to historical witnesses such as reinhard mohn , the son of heinrich mohn , the company ’ s director during the third reich .
corporate archive open to public referring to the ihc 's investigation , thielen said , " this experience has reinforced for us why historical accuracy and transparency must be an integral part of our company ’ s core values , and we hope to serve as an example to other companies about the importance of this .

but the new prices will force spontaneous and business travelers to dig deeper into their pockets . germany 's national railway introduced a new pricing system on wednesday , which deutsche bahn hopes will get more people off the roads , out of the skies and back onto the tracks . “ rail travel for millions of people will cheaper than ever , ” bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn declared at a press conference in berlin . a complex pricing structure currently , rail tickets in germany are priced by distance - approximately 14 cents per kilometer .
nor are there any savings incentives for booking in advance . the system is n't terribly popular with the public , and train travel in germany fell by 4.4 percent in 2002 , according to an interim report released by the company in june .
deutsche bahn is hoping to reverse its fortunes with the new pricing system as well as a much-hyped new high-speed rail line connecting the major hub cities of cologne and frankfurt in just over an hour . the new system , which goes into effect on dec .
15 and is modelled after pricing mechanisms used by the airlines , creates an incentive for passengers to buy their tickets seven days or more in advance by offering them considerible savings if they do . like the airlines , deutsche bahn is betting the system will allow it to better fill empty seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn -lrb- left -rrb- bahn is calling the new system “ clear and transparent . ”
and mehdorn -lrb- photo , left -rrb- believes it is more logical and intuitive than what he describes as the current “ tariff jungle . ” “ at the moment we calculate prices by the kilometer , " deutsche bahn spokesman andreas fuhrmann said . " but it ’ s simply not clear for customers .
they don ’ t have a map by which they can measure the distances out ; it 's not easy to work out which ticket is the best value for thier money .
we want to make things easier for them with this new system . ” winners and losers families will be the biggest winners . children under 14 accompanied by their parents can travel free of charge .
under the old system , this offer only applied to children up to 6 years of age . but for spontaneous or business travelers who require flexibility , travel costs will increase significantly under the new system . travelers who can ’ t book in advance will , in many cases , be punished under the new pricing system . it also deals a heavy blow to holders of the company 's loyalty card , the " bahncard , " which currently entitles customers to a 50-percent discount off the standard fare , even if a ticket is purchased on the day of travel .
the card will continue to exist , but the annual subscription rate will drop to 60 euro -lrb- from the current 140 euro -rrb- and allow consumers to save between 25 percent and 50 percent , depending on how far in advance they book . customers who do not possess the bahncard and are able to plan their journeys in advance will be the biggest winners , reaping savings as high as 40 percent if they book seven days or more ahead , 25 percent three days before travel and 10 percent up to the day before travel . deutsche bahn is also hoping that by reducing the cost of long journeys it can lure customers away from budget air carriers or their cars . journeys of more than 180 kilometers will be up to 27 percent cheaper under the new system .
for example , a ticket between berlin and frankfurt will cost 86.40 euro - 19 percent cheaper than before . critics unimpressed despite support from the german government for its new pricing system , consumer groups are less enthusiastic about deutsche bahn 's new rules . walter hirrlinger , president of vdk , an organisation which represents and cares for war victims and pensioners in germany , called the reforms a " rip-off . "
the new pricing structure would hugely disadvantage the approximately 820,000 chronically sick , disabled and old people in germany who currently posses a bahn card entitling them to a 50 percent fare reduction , he declared in a statement issued on wednesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's super fast train set for take-off germany 's newly completed rail link between cologne and frankfurt could provide the impetus for a europe-wide high-speed rail network .

on monday the company was forced to face up to its wartime past after revelations surrounding the publisher ’ s activities surfaced in a 794-page report by the independent historical commission -lrb- ihc -rrb- , which had been called upon to investigate the company ’ s link to the nazis .
the ihc 's investigation uncovered contradictions in the company 's version of its wartime activities , as well as some unknown details that have now been exposed .
bertelsmann thrived under nazis the commission 's investigations showed that bertelsmann did not resist hitler and the third reich as previously reported by the company in its corporate reports , but instead thrived during world war ii by producing anti-semitic material and nazi propaganda .
according to the ihc report , the traditional family-run publishing house was motivated by financial profits to take on several printing contracts given by the nazi government .
within just a few years , bertelsmann grew to become the largest book producer for the german army during the war , publishing some 19 million editions .
most of the publications were brochures and pamphlets intended to strengthen the morale and courage of soldiers on the front , but many of the works also contained extreme derogatory texts about foreigners and jews .
in addition , the ihc study reveals that although bertelsmann itself was not directly involved in employing nazi slave labourers , several of the company ’ s printing houses in vilnius , lithuania , relied on cheap jewish labourers from the local ghetto to run their presses .
the commission also adds that it is very likely that nazi slave labourers were used in associated printing houses in riga , latvia .
end of a company legend until the historical commission began investigating the company ’ s history in the late 1990s , bertelsmann had always maintained its historically active role in the nazi resistance .
from 1945 on , the christian-based company claimed it had been shut down by the nazis for anti-government tendencies .
but the commission ’ s report indicates that this was a mere " legend " that had been invented by the company in order to receive a publishing license from the occupying forces as quickly as possible .

9 , the world ’ s largest book fair opens in frankfurt .
but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .
and real book enthusiasts , publishers , book sellers and readers , for whom the book is more than just a simple product will again have the say . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the international book fair in frankfurt 2002 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the new prices will force spontaneous and business travelers to dig deeper into their pockets . germany 's national railway introduced a new pricing system on wednesday , which deutsche bahn hopes will get more people off the roads , out of the skies and back onto the tracks . “ rail travel for millions of people will cheaper than ever , ” bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn declared at a press conference in berlin . a complex pricing structure currently , rail tickets in germany are priced by distance - approximately 14 cents per kilometer .
nor are there any savings incentives for booking in advance . the system is n't terribly popular with the public , and train travel in germany fell by 4.4 percent in 2002 , according to an interim report released by the company in june .
deutsche bahn is hoping to reverse its fortunes with the new pricing system as well as a much-hyped new high-speed rail line connecting the major hub cities of cologne and frankfurt in just over an hour . the new system , which goes into effect on dec .
15 and is modelled after pricing mechanisms used by the airlines , creates an incentive for passengers to buy their tickets seven days or more in advance by offering them considerible savings if they do . like the airlines , deutsche bahn is betting the system will allow it to better fill empty seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn -lrb- left -rrb- bahn is calling the new system “ clear and transparent . ”
and mehdorn -lrb- photo , left -rrb- believes it is more logical and intuitive than what he describes as the current “ tariff jungle . ” “ at the moment we calculate prices by the kilometer , " deutsche bahn spokesman andreas fuhrmann said . " but it ’ s simply not clear for customers .
they don ’ t have a map by which they can measure the distances out ; it 's not easy to work out which ticket is the best value for thier money .
we want to make things easier for them with this new system . ” winners and losers families will be the biggest winners . children under 14 accompanied by their parents can travel free of charge .
under the old system , this offer only applied to children up to 6 years of age . but for spontaneous or business travelers who require flexibility , travel costs will increase significantly under the new system . travelers who can ’ t book in advance will , in many cases , be punished under the new pricing system . it also deals a heavy blow to holders of the company 's loyalty card , the " bahncard , " which currently entitles customers to a 50-percent discount off the standard fare , even if a ticket is purchased on the day of travel .
the card will continue to exist , but the annual subscription rate will drop to 60 euro -lrb- from the current 140 euro -rrb- and allow consumers to save between 25 percent and 50 percent , depending on how far in advance they book . customers who do not possess the bahncard and are able to plan their journeys in advance will be the biggest winners , reaping savings as high as 40 percent if they book seven days or more ahead , 25 percent three days before travel and 10 percent up to the day before travel . deutsche bahn is also hoping that by reducing the cost of long journeys it can lure customers away from budget air carriers or their cars . journeys of more than 180 kilometers will be up to 27 percent cheaper under the new system .
for example , a ticket between berlin and frankfurt will cost 86.40 euro - 19 percent cheaper than before . critics unimpressed despite support from the german government for its new pricing system , consumer groups are less enthusiastic about deutsche bahn 's new rules . walter hirrlinger , president of vdk , an organisation which represents and cares for war victims and pensioners in germany , called the reforms a " rip-off . "
the new pricing structure would hugely disadvantage the approximately 820,000 chronically sick , disabled and old people in germany who currently posses a bahn card entitling them to a 50 percent fare reduction , he declared in a statement issued on wednesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's super fast train set for take-off germany 's newly completed rail link between cologne and frankfurt could provide the impetus for a europe-wide high-speed rail network .

senior citizens are taking to the world wide web as the number of ' silver surfers ' soars . the over-50 's are logging on to the internet in surprisingly high numbers , according to a symposium on the ' silver surfer ' phenomenon held at frankfurt university .
the week long symposium , put together by the frankfurt-based senior citizens web site feierabend.com and deutsche telekom , has been organised to discuss the boom in sites aimed at the over-50 's .
it also reveals the increasing numbers who are using the internet for research and entertainment purposes .
in 1995 , three percent of net surfers were older than 50 years of age ; today that number has risen to 20 percent .
estimates suggest that by 2003 , a quarter of all internet surfers will be in the ' silver surfer ' age bracket .
germany is a country with an aging population .

a study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin shows that most seniors connected to the world wide web are able to spend up to 600 euro per person every month .

senior citizens are taking to the world wide web as the number of ' silver surfers ' soars . the over-50 's are logging on to the internet in surprisingly high numbers , according to a symposium on the ' silver surfer ' phenomenon held at frankfurt university .
the week long symposium , put together by the frankfurt-based senior citizens web site feierabend.com and deutsche telekom , has been organised to discuss the boom in sites aimed at the over-50 's .
it also reveals the increasing numbers who are using the internet for research and entertainment purposes .
in 1995 , three percent of net surfers were older than 50 years of age ; today that number has risen to 20 percent .
estimates suggest that by 2003 , a quarter of all internet surfers will be in the ' silver surfer ' age bracket .
germany is a country with an aging population .
the former christian social union 's minister for family ursula lehr , told the german wires , " we have more people over 60 than under 20 . "
in many areas , this will become problematic in the future , she said .
senior business boom for the specialist pages on the internet catering to senior citizens , that ’ s good news .
with over 4.5 million senior citizens online in germany , businesses are waking up to this previously untapped market .
internet businesses and e-commerce service providers have begun recognizing that senior citizens make for an especially lucrative clientele .
" at the moment , seniors account for a strong consumer sector , " said lehr who is also a certified gerontologist , a scientist that studies the biological , psychological , and sociological phenomena associated with aging .
a study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin shows that most seniors connected to the world wide web are able to spend up to 600 euro per person every month .
because many of them are bound to their homes , shopping online is a popular activity .
about 60 percent of wired seniors have already ordered something over the internet at least once , the study indicates .
special " silver surfer " sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii in the vatican chat room .
the explosion in pages catering to the interests of senior citizens , similar to feierabend.com , proves that there is a market on the internet for leisure time and information sites for the over-50 's .
regular services like news , entertainment and travel sites are all being tailored specifically for this new ' old ' generation of cyber surfers .
and once they are online , most give the pages their undivided attention .
compared to today ’ s youth , who quickly click to the newest interactive and animated sites once they lose patience , the older generation of slower more patient surfers tends to be more methodical in its use of the internet and ultimately gains more satisfaction from time online .
a study by british organization age concern shows that senior citizens use the internet very much like the younger generation , with the two sexes showing interest in varied subjects .
men prefer to use the internet to pursue hobbies and find out information , whereas women see the net as an alternative to the telephone , using it to chat with friends and families .
among both sexes , over-50 's are four times more likely to visit ancestry and genealogy sites than the average younger internet users , according to age concern 's research .

nor are there any savings incentives for booking in advance . the system is n't terribly popular with the public , and train travel in germany fell by 4.4 percent in 2002 , according to an interim report released by the company in june .

but the new prices will force spontaneous and business travelers to dig deeper into their pockets . germany 's national railway introduced a new pricing system on wednesday , which deutsche bahn hopes will get more people off the roads , out of the skies and back onto the tracks . “ rail travel for millions of people will cheaper than ever , ” bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn declared at a press conference in berlin . a complex pricing structure currently , rail tickets in germany are priced by distance - approximately 14 cents per kilometer .
nor are there any savings incentives for booking in advance . the system is n't terribly popular with the public , and train travel in germany fell by 4.4 percent in 2002 , according to an interim report released by the company in june .
deutsche bahn is hoping to reverse its fortunes with the new pricing system as well as a much-hyped new high-speed rail line connecting the major hub cities of cologne and frankfurt in just over an hour . the new system , which goes into effect on dec .
15 and is modelled after pricing mechanisms used by the airlines , creates an incentive for passengers to buy their tickets seven days or more in advance by offering them considerible savings if they do . like the airlines , deutsche bahn is betting the system will allow it to better fill empty seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn -lrb- left -rrb- bahn is calling the new system “ clear and transparent . ”
and mehdorn -lrb- photo , left -rrb- believes it is more logical and intuitive than what he describes as the current “ tariff jungle . ” “ at the moment we calculate prices by the kilometer , " deutsche bahn spokesman andreas fuhrmann said . " but it ’ s simply not clear for customers .
they don ’ t have a map by which they can measure the distances out ; it 's not easy to work out which ticket is the best value for thier money .
we want to make things easier for them with this new system . ” winners and losers families will be the biggest winners . children under 14 accompanied by their parents can travel free of charge .
under the old system , this offer only applied to children up to 6 years of age . but for spontaneous or business travelers who require flexibility , travel costs will increase significantly under the new system . travelers who can ’ t book in advance will , in many cases , be punished under the new pricing system . it also deals a heavy blow to holders of the company 's loyalty card , the " bahncard , " which currently entitles customers to a 50-percent discount off the standard fare , even if a ticket is purchased on the day of travel .
the card will continue to exist , but the annual subscription rate will drop to 60 euro -lrb- from the current 140 euro -rrb- and allow consumers to save between 25 percent and 50 percent , depending on how far in advance they book . customers who do not possess the bahncard and are able to plan their journeys in advance will be the biggest winners , reaping savings as high as 40 percent if they book seven days or more ahead , 25 percent three days before travel and 10 percent up to the day before travel . deutsche bahn is also hoping that by reducing the cost of long journeys it can lure customers away from budget air carriers or their cars . journeys of more than 180 kilometers will be up to 27 percent cheaper under the new system .
for example , a ticket between berlin and frankfurt will cost 86.40 euro - 19 percent cheaper than before . critics unimpressed despite support from the german government for its new pricing system , consumer groups are less enthusiastic about deutsche bahn 's new rules . walter hirrlinger , president of vdk , an organisation which represents and cares for war victims and pensioners in germany , called the reforms a " rip-off . "
the new pricing structure would hugely disadvantage the approximately 820,000 chronically sick , disabled and old people in germany who currently posses a bahn card entitling them to a 50 percent fare reduction , he declared in a statement issued on wednesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's super fast train set for take-off germany 's newly completed rail link between cologne and frankfurt could provide the impetus for a europe-wide high-speed rail network .

9 , the world ’ s largest book fair opens in frankfurt .
but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .

9 , the world ’ s largest book fair opens in frankfurt .
but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .

fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .

senior citizens are taking to the world wide web as the number of ' silver surfers ' soars . the over-50 's are logging on to the internet in surprisingly high numbers , according to a symposium on the ' silver surfer ' phenomenon held at frankfurt university .
the week long symposium , put together by the frankfurt-based senior citizens web site feierabend.com and deutsche telekom , has been organised to discuss the boom in sites aimed at the over-50 's .
it also reveals the increasing numbers who are using the internet for research and entertainment purposes .
in 1995 , three percent of net surfers were older than 50 years of age ; today that number has risen to 20 percent .
estimates suggest that by 2003 , a quarter of all internet surfers will be in the ' silver surfer ' age bracket .
germany is a country with an aging population .
the former christian social union 's minister for family ursula lehr , told the german wires , " we have more people over 60 than under 20 . "
in many areas , this will become problematic in the future , she said .
senior business boom for the specialist pages on the internet catering to senior citizens , that ’ s good news .
with over 4.5 million senior citizens online in germany , businesses are waking up to this previously untapped market .
internet businesses and e-commerce service providers have begun recognizing that senior citizens make for an especially lucrative clientele .
" at the moment , seniors account for a strong consumer sector , " said lehr who is also a certified gerontologist , a scientist that studies the biological , psychological , and sociological phenomena associated with aging .
a study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin shows that most seniors connected to the world wide web are able to spend up to 600 euro per person every month .
because many of them are bound to their homes , shopping online is a popular activity .
about 60 percent of wired seniors have already ordered something over the internet at least once , the study indicates .
special " silver surfer " sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii in the vatican chat room .
the explosion in pages catering to the interests of senior citizens , similar to feierabend.com , proves that there is a market on the internet for leisure time and information sites for the over-50 's .
regular services like news , entertainment and travel sites are all being tailored specifically for this new ' old ' generation of cyber surfers .
and once they are online , most give the pages their undivided attention .
compared to today ’ s youth , who quickly click to the newest interactive and animated sites once they lose patience , the older generation of slower more patient surfers tends to be more methodical in its use of the internet and ultimately gains more satisfaction from time online .
a study by british organization age concern shows that senior citizens use the internet very much like the younger generation , with the two sexes showing interest in varied subjects .
men prefer to use the internet to pursue hobbies and find out information , whereas women see the net as an alternative to the telephone , using it to chat with friends and families .
among both sexes , over-50 's are four times more likely to visit ancestry and genealogy sites than the average younger internet users , according to age concern 's research .
new quality of life the internet has given many a new lease on life , making it possible for housebound people and relatives of families divided by distance to keep in contact .
it is the perfect bridge to the outside world , an antidote to crippling loneliness and a practical tool for communicating with children and grandchildren .
it 's faster than an ordinary letter , and it gives older people a feeling of " keeping with the times " and remaining sprightly and mentally fit as one grows older .
almost all seniors agreed , that once they use the web they become hooked , with two-thirds agreeing that it had had a positive impact on their lives . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wired seniors storm the virtual world as germany wrings its hands over the lack of qualified computer specialists , a soaring number of its silver-haired citizens gets net-savvy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.10.2002 german rail introduces new price system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn executives hope lower prices will bring more people back to the rails with its new pricing system , deutsche bahn is hoping to get more people traveling by train in germany .
but the new prices will force spontaneous and business travelers to dig deeper into their pockets . germany 's national railway introduced a new pricing system on wednesday , which deutsche bahn hopes will get more people off the roads , out of the skies and back onto the tracks . “ rail travel for millions of people will cheaper than ever , ” bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn declared at a press conference in berlin . a complex pricing structure currently , rail tickets in germany are priced by distance - approximately 14 cents per kilometer .
nor are there any savings incentives for booking in advance . the system is n't terribly popular with the public , and train travel in germany fell by 4.4 percent in 2002 , according to an interim report released by the company in june .
deutsche bahn is hoping to reverse its fortunes with the new pricing system as well as a much-hyped new high-speed rail line connecting the major hub cities of cologne and frankfurt in just over an hour . the new system , which goes into effect on dec .
15 and is modelled after pricing mechanisms used by the airlines , creates an incentive for passengers to buy their tickets seven days or more in advance by offering them considerible savings if they do . like the airlines , deutsche bahn is betting the system will allow it to better fill empty seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn -lrb- left -rrb- bahn is calling the new system “ clear and transparent . ”
and mehdorn -lrb- photo , left -rrb- believes it is more logical and intuitive than what he describes as the current “ tariff jungle . ” “ at the moment we calculate prices by the kilometer , " deutsche bahn spokesman andreas fuhrmann said . " but it ’ s simply not clear for customers .
they don ’ t have a map by which they can measure the distances out ; it 's not easy to work out which ticket is the best value for thier money .
we want to make things easier for them with this new system . ” winners and losers families will be the biggest winners . children under 14 accompanied by their parents can travel free of charge .
under the old system , this offer only applied to children up to 6 years of age . but for spontaneous or business travelers who require flexibility , travel costs will increase significantly under the new system . travelers who can ’ t book in advance will , in many cases , be punished under the new pricing system . it also deals a heavy blow to holders of the company 's loyalty card , the " bahncard , " which currently entitles customers to a 50-percent discount off the standard fare , even if a ticket is purchased on the day of travel .
the card will continue to exist , but the annual subscription rate will drop to 60 euro -lrb- from the current 140 euro -rrb- and allow consumers to save between 25 percent and 50 percent , depending on how far in advance they book . customers who do not possess the bahncard and are able to plan their journeys in advance will be the biggest winners , reaping savings as high as 40 percent if they book seven days or more ahead , 25 percent three days before travel and 10 percent up to the day before travel . deutsche bahn is also hoping that by reducing the cost of long journeys it can lure customers away from budget air carriers or their cars . journeys of more than 180 kilometers will be up to 27 percent cheaper under the new system .
for example , a ticket between berlin and frankfurt will cost 86.40 euro - 19 percent cheaper than before . critics unimpressed despite support from the german government for its new pricing system , consumer groups are less enthusiastic about deutsche bahn 's new rules . walter hirrlinger , president of vdk , an organisation which represents and cares for war victims and pensioners in germany , called the reforms a " rip-off . "
the new pricing structure would hugely disadvantage the approximately 820,000 chronically sick , disabled and old people in germany who currently posses a bahn card entitling them to a 50 percent fare reduction , he declared in a statement issued on wednesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's super fast train set for take-off germany 's newly completed rail link between cologne and frankfurt could provide the impetus for a europe-wide high-speed rail network .

on monday the company was forced to face up to its wartime past after revelations surrounding the publisher ’ s activities surfaced in a 794-page report by the independent historical commission -lrb- ihc -rrb- , which had been called upon to investigate the company ’ s link to the nazis .
the ihc 's investigation uncovered contradictions in the company 's version of its wartime activities , as well as some unknown details that have now been exposed .
bertelsmann thrived under nazis the commission 's investigations showed that bertelsmann did not resist hitler and the third reich as previously reported by the company in its corporate reports , but instead thrived during world war ii by producing anti-semitic material and nazi propaganda .
according to the ihc report , the traditional family-run publishing house was motivated by financial profits to take on several printing contracts given by the nazi government .
within just a few years , bertelsmann grew to become the largest book producer for the german army during the war , publishing some 19 million editions .
most of the publications were brochures and pamphlets intended to strengthen the morale and courage of soldiers on the front , but many of the works also contained extreme derogatory texts about foreigners and jews .
in addition , the ihc study reveals that although bertelsmann itself was not directly involved in employing nazi slave labourers , several of the company ’ s printing houses in vilnius , lithuania , relied on cheap jewish labourers from the local ghetto to run their presses .
the commission also adds that it is very likely that nazi slave labourers were used in associated printing houses in riga , latvia .
end of a company legend until the historical commission began investigating the company ’ s history in the late 1990s , bertelsmann had always maintained its historically active role in the nazi resistance .
from 1945 on , the christian-based company claimed it had been shut down by the nazis for anti-government tendencies .
but the commission ’ s report indicates that this was a mere " legend " that had been invented by the company in order to receive a publishing license from the occupying forces as quickly as possible .
in reality , bertelsmann was closed in 1944 because it was found guilty of hoarding paper and could no longer turn a good profit .
official historical record " bertelsmann ag unreservedly accepts the independent historical commission 's report as the official record of the company 's history during the third reich , " said bertelsmann 's chief operating officer günter thielen in an official statement on the company 's web site .
" i would like to express our sincere regret for the inaccuracies the commission has uncovered in our previous corporate history of the world war ii era , as well as for the wartime activities that have been brought to light , " thielen said .
the independent historical commission , a group of four scholars , headed by university of california historian saul friedlander , worked on the report for over three years , painstakingly researching and documenting the company ’ s history under the nazi regime .
the commission was called upon by bertelsmann to investigate the company ’ s wartime era history following the publication of an article entitled " bertelsmann 's nazi past " which appeared in the nation magazine in december 1998 .
throughout the investigation , the scholars had full access to the bertelsmann company archives as well as contact to historical witnesses such as reinhard mohn , the son of heinrich mohn , the company ’ s director during the third reich .
corporate archive open to public referring to the ihc 's investigation , thielen said , " this experience has reinforced for us why historical accuracy and transparency must be an integral part of our company ’ s core values , and we hope to serve as an example to other companies about the importance of this . "
" this has also shown us how , as one of the largest media companies in the world , we have a special responsibility to promote openness and public debate on these issues , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bertelsmann headquarters in gütersloh , germany , will be home to the commission 's evidence .
as a result of the ihc ’ s findings , thielen said that bertelsmann will now open an interim corporate archive on october 8th where the complete archives of the company 's corporate history will be open to the public .
the archive will be managed by a team of professional historians until march 31st , 2003 when the archives will be transferred to the bertelsmann foundation headquarters in gütersloh , where they will remain available to the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bertelsmann restructures thomas middelhoff ’ s successor at bertelsmann is a loyal company man who enjoys the type of trust from the influential mohn family middelhoff never did .

within just a few years , bertelsmann grew to become the largest book producer for the german army during the war , publishing some 19 million editions .
most of the publications were brochures and pamphlets intended to strengthen the morale and courage of soldiers on the front , but many of the works also contained extreme derogatory texts about foreigners and jews .
in addition , the ihc study reveals that although bertelsmann itself was not directly involved in employing nazi slave labourers , several of the company ’ s printing houses in vilnius , lithuania , relied on cheap jewish labourers from the local ghetto to run their presses .
the commission also adds that it is very likely that nazi slave labourers were used in associated printing houses in riga , latvia .
end of a company legend until the historical commission began investigating the company ’ s history in the late 1990s , bertelsmann had always maintained its historically active role in the nazi resistance .
from 1945 on , the christian-based company claimed it had been shut down by the nazis for anti-government tendencies .
but the commission ’ s report indicates that this was a mere " legend " that had been invented by the company in order to receive a publishing license from the occupying forces as quickly as possible .
in reality , bertelsmann was closed in 1944 because it was found guilty of hoarding paper and could no longer turn a good profit .
official historical record " bertelsmann ag unreservedly accepts the independent historical commission 's report as the official record of the company 's history during the third reich , " said bertelsmann 's chief operating officer günter thielen in an official statement on the company 's web site .
" i would like to express our sincere regret for the inaccuracies the commission has uncovered in our previous corporate history of the world war ii era , as well as for the wartime activities that have been brought to light , " thielen said .
the independent historical commission , a group of four scholars , headed by university of california historian saul friedlander , worked on the report for over three years , painstakingly researching and documenting the company ’ s history under the nazi regime .
the commission was called upon by bertelsmann to investigate the company ’ s wartime era history following the publication of an article entitled " bertelsmann 's nazi past " which appeared in the nation magazine in december 1998 .
throughout the investigation , the scholars had full access to the bertelsmann company archives as well as contact to historical witnesses such as reinhard mohn , the son of heinrich mohn , the company ’ s director during the third reich .
corporate archive open to public referring to the ihc 's investigation , thielen said , " this experience has reinforced for us why historical accuracy and transparency must be an integral part of our company ’ s core values , and we hope to serve as an example to other companies about the importance of this . "
" this has also shown us how , as one of the largest media companies in the world , we have a special responsibility to promote openness and public debate on these issues , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bertelsmann headquarters in gütersloh , germany , will be home to the commission 's evidence .
as a result of the ihc ’ s findings , thielen said that bertelsmann will now open an interim corporate archive on october 8th where the complete archives of the company 's corporate history will be open to the public .

on monday the company was forced to face up to its wartime past after revelations surrounding the publisher ’ s activities surfaced in a 794-page report by the independent historical commission -lrb- ihc -rrb- , which had been called upon to investigate the company ’ s link to the nazis .
the ihc 's investigation uncovered contradictions in the company 's version of its wartime activities , as well as some unknown details that have now been exposed .
bertelsmann thrived under nazis the commission 's investigations showed that bertelsmann did not resist hitler and the third reich as previously reported by the company in its corporate reports , but instead thrived during world war ii by producing anti-semitic material and nazi propaganda .
according to the ihc report , the traditional family-run publishing house was motivated by financial profits to take on several printing contracts given by the nazi government .
within just a few years , bertelsmann grew to become the largest book producer for the german army during the war , publishing some 19 million editions .
most of the publications were brochures and pamphlets intended to strengthen the morale and courage of soldiers on the front , but many of the works also contained extreme derogatory texts about foreigners and jews .
in addition , the ihc study reveals that although bertelsmann itself was not directly involved in employing nazi slave labourers , several of the company ’ s printing houses in vilnius , lithuania , relied on cheap jewish labourers from the local ghetto to run their presses .
the commission also adds that it is very likely that nazi slave labourers were used in associated printing houses in riga , latvia .
end of a company legend until the historical commission began investigating the company ’ s history in the late 1990s , bertelsmann had always maintained its historically active role in the nazi resistance .
from 1945 on , the christian-based company claimed it had been shut down by the nazis for anti-government tendencies .
but the commission ’ s report indicates that this was a mere " legend " that had been invented by the company in order to receive a publishing license from the occupying forces as quickly as possible .
in reality , bertelsmann was closed in 1944 because it was found guilty of hoarding paper and could no longer turn a good profit .
official historical record " bertelsmann ag unreservedly accepts the independent historical commission 's report as the official record of the company 's history during the third reich , " said bertelsmann 's chief operating officer günter thielen in an official statement on the company 's web site .
" i would like to express our sincere regret for the inaccuracies the commission has uncovered in our previous corporate history of the world war ii era , as well as for the wartime activities that have been brought to light , " thielen said .
the independent historical commission , a group of four scholars , headed by university of california historian saul friedlander , worked on the report for over three years , painstakingly researching and documenting the company ’ s history under the nazi regime .
the commission was called upon by bertelsmann to investigate the company ’ s wartime era history following the publication of an article entitled " bertelsmann 's nazi past " which appeared in the nation magazine in december 1998 .
throughout the investigation , the scholars had full access to the bertelsmann company archives as well as contact to historical witnesses such as reinhard mohn , the son of heinrich mohn , the company ’ s director during the third reich .
corporate archive open to public referring to the ihc 's investigation , thielen said , " this experience has reinforced for us why historical accuracy and transparency must be an integral part of our company ’ s core values , and we hope to serve as an example to other companies about the importance of this . "
" this has also shown us how , as one of the largest media companies in the world , we have a special responsibility to promote openness and public debate on these issues , " he added .

the week long symposium , put together by the frankfurt-based senior citizens web site feierabend.com and deutsche telekom , has been organised to discuss the boom in sites aimed at the over-50 's .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.10.2002 german rail introduces new price system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn executives hope lower prices will bring more people back to the rails with its new pricing system , deutsche bahn is hoping to get more people traveling by train in germany .
but the new prices will force spontaneous and business travelers to dig deeper into their pockets . germany 's national railway introduced a new pricing system on wednesday , which deutsche bahn hopes will get more people off the roads , out of the skies and back onto the tracks . “ rail travel for millions of people will cheaper than ever , ” bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn declared at a press conference in berlin . a complex pricing structure currently , rail tickets in germany are priced by distance - approximately 14 cents per kilometer .
nor are there any savings incentives for booking in advance . the system is n't terribly popular with the public , and train travel in germany fell by 4.4 percent in 2002 , according to an interim report released by the company in june .
deutsche bahn is hoping to reverse its fortunes with the new pricing system as well as a much-hyped new high-speed rail line connecting the major hub cities of cologne and frankfurt in just over an hour . the new system , which goes into effect on dec .
15 and is modelled after pricing mechanisms used by the airlines , creates an incentive for passengers to buy their tickets seven days or more in advance by offering them considerible savings if they do . like the airlines , deutsche bahn is betting the system will allow it to better fill empty seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn -lrb- left -rrb- bahn is calling the new system “ clear and transparent . ”
and mehdorn -lrb- photo , left -rrb- believes it is more logical and intuitive than what he describes as the current “ tariff jungle . ” “ at the moment we calculate prices by the kilometer , " deutsche bahn spokesman andreas fuhrmann said . " but it ’ s simply not clear for customers .
they don ’ t have a map by which they can measure the distances out ; it 's not easy to work out which ticket is the best value for thier money .
we want to make things easier for them with this new system . ” winners and losers families will be the biggest winners . children under 14 accompanied by their parents can travel free of charge .
under the old system , this offer only applied to children up to 6 years of age . but for spontaneous or business travelers who require flexibility , travel costs will increase significantly under the new system . travelers who can ’ t book in advance will , in many cases , be punished under the new pricing system . it also deals a heavy blow to holders of the company 's loyalty card , the " bahncard , " which currently entitles customers to a 50-percent discount off the standard fare , even if a ticket is purchased on the day of travel .
the card will continue to exist , but the annual subscription rate will drop to 60 euro -lrb- from the current 140 euro -rrb- and allow consumers to save between 25 percent and 50 percent , depending on how far in advance they book . customers who do not possess the bahncard and are able to plan their journeys in advance will be the biggest winners , reaping savings as high as 40 percent if they book seven days or more ahead , 25 percent three days before travel and 10 percent up to the day before travel . deutsche bahn is also hoping that by reducing the cost of long journeys it can lure customers away from budget air carriers or their cars . journeys of more than 180 kilometers will be up to 27 percent cheaper under the new system .
for example , a ticket between berlin and frankfurt will cost 86.40 euro - 19 percent cheaper than before . critics unimpressed despite support from the german government for its new pricing system , consumer groups are less enthusiastic about deutsche bahn 's new rules . walter hirrlinger , president of vdk , an organisation which represents and cares for war victims and pensioners in germany , called the reforms a " rip-off . "
the new pricing structure would hugely disadvantage the approximately 820,000 chronically sick , disabled and old people in germany who currently posses a bahn card entitling them to a 50 percent fare reduction , he declared in a statement issued on wednesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's super fast train set for take-off germany 's newly completed rail link between cologne and frankfurt could provide the impetus for a europe-wide high-speed rail network .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.10.2002 senior citizens keep on surfing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leading by example : german politician edmund stoiber logs on internet chat rooms and late night surfing are no longer the sole domain of the square-eyed younger generation .
senior citizens are taking to the world wide web as the number of ' silver surfers ' soars . the over-50 's are logging on to the internet in surprisingly high numbers , according to a symposium on the ' silver surfer ' phenomenon held at frankfurt university .
the week long symposium , put together by the frankfurt-based senior citizens web site feierabend.com and deutsche telekom , has been organised to discuss the boom in sites aimed at the over-50 's .
it also reveals the increasing numbers who are using the internet for research and entertainment purposes .
in 1995 , three percent of net surfers were older than 50 years of age ; today that number has risen to 20 percent .
estimates suggest that by 2003 , a quarter of all internet surfers will be in the ' silver surfer ' age bracket .
germany is a country with an aging population .
the former christian social union 's minister for family ursula lehr , told the german wires , " we have more people over 60 than under 20 . "
in many areas , this will become problematic in the future , she said .
senior business boom for the specialist pages on the internet catering to senior citizens , that ’ s good news .
with over 4.5 million senior citizens online in germany , businesses are waking up to this previously untapped market .
internet businesses and e-commerce service providers have begun recognizing that senior citizens make for an especially lucrative clientele .
" at the moment , seniors account for a strong consumer sector , " said lehr who is also a certified gerontologist , a scientist that studies the biological , psychological , and sociological phenomena associated with aging .
a study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin shows that most seniors connected to the world wide web are able to spend up to 600 euro per person every month .
because many of them are bound to their homes , shopping online is a popular activity .
about 60 percent of wired seniors have already ordered something over the internet at least once , the study indicates .
special " silver surfer " sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii in the vatican chat room .
the explosion in pages catering to the interests of senior citizens , similar to feierabend.com , proves that there is a market on the internet for leisure time and information sites for the over-50 's .
regular services like news , entertainment and travel sites are all being tailored specifically for this new ' old ' generation of cyber surfers .
and once they are online , most give the pages their undivided attention .
compared to today ’ s youth , who quickly click to the newest interactive and animated sites once they lose patience , the older generation of slower more patient surfers tends to be more methodical in its use of the internet and ultimately gains more satisfaction from time online .
a study by british organization age concern shows that senior citizens use the internet very much like the younger generation , with the two sexes showing interest in varied subjects .
men prefer to use the internet to pursue hobbies and find out information , whereas women see the net as an alternative to the telephone , using it to chat with friends and families .
among both sexes , over-50 's are four times more likely to visit ancestry and genealogy sites than the average younger internet users , according to age concern 's research .
new quality of life the internet has given many a new lease on life , making it possible for housebound people and relatives of families divided by distance to keep in contact .
it is the perfect bridge to the outside world , an antidote to crippling loneliness and a practical tool for communicating with children and grandchildren .
it 's faster than an ordinary letter , and it gives older people a feeling of " keeping with the times " and remaining sprightly and mentally fit as one grows older .
almost all seniors agreed , that once they use the web they become hooked , with two-thirds agreeing that it had had a positive impact on their lives . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wired seniors storm the virtual world as germany wrings its hands over the lack of qualified computer specialists , a soaring number of its silver-haired citizens gets net-savvy .

hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.10.2002 bertelsmann admits to nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertelsmann ceo günter thielen apologizes for company 's past the independent historical commission set up to research bertelsmann 's wartime history presented its final report in munich today prompting sincere regret from the company . bertelsmann , the international media and publishing giant , has become the latest in a line of german companies to admit having connections to hitler ’ s third reich during world war ii .
on monday the company was forced to face up to its wartime past after revelations surrounding the publisher ’ s activities surfaced in a 794-page report by the independent historical commission -lrb- ihc -rrb- , which had been called upon to investigate the company ’ s link to the nazis .
the ihc 's investigation uncovered contradictions in the company 's version of its wartime activities , as well as some unknown details that have now been exposed .
bertelsmann thrived under nazis the commission 's investigations showed that bertelsmann did not resist hitler and the third reich as previously reported by the company in its corporate reports , but instead thrived during world war ii by producing anti-semitic material and nazi propaganda .
according to the ihc report , the traditional family-run publishing house was motivated by financial profits to take on several printing contracts given by the nazi government .
within just a few years , bertelsmann grew to become the largest book producer for the german army during the war , publishing some 19 million editions .
most of the publications were brochures and pamphlets intended to strengthen the morale and courage of soldiers on the front , but many of the works also contained extreme derogatory texts about foreigners and jews .
in addition , the ihc study reveals that although bertelsmann itself was not directly involved in employing nazi slave labourers , several of the company ’ s printing houses in vilnius , lithuania , relied on cheap jewish labourers from the local ghetto to run their presses .
the commission also adds that it is very likely that nazi slave labourers were used in associated printing houses in riga , latvia .
end of a company legend until the historical commission began investigating the company ’ s history in the late 1990s , bertelsmann had always maintained its historically active role in the nazi resistance .
from 1945 on , the christian-based company claimed it had been shut down by the nazis for anti-government tendencies .
but the commission ’ s report indicates that this was a mere " legend " that had been invented by the company in order to receive a publishing license from the occupying forces as quickly as possible .
in reality , bertelsmann was closed in 1944 because it was found guilty of hoarding paper and could no longer turn a good profit .
official historical record " bertelsmann ag unreservedly accepts the independent historical commission 's report as the official record of the company 's history during the third reich , " said bertelsmann 's chief operating officer günter thielen in an official statement on the company 's web site .
" i would like to express our sincere regret for the inaccuracies the commission has uncovered in our previous corporate history of the world war ii era , as well as for the wartime activities that have been brought to light , " thielen said .
the independent historical commission , a group of four scholars , headed by university of california historian saul friedlander , worked on the report for over three years , painstakingly researching and documenting the company ’ s history under the nazi regime .
the commission was called upon by bertelsmann to investigate the company ’ s wartime era history following the publication of an article entitled " bertelsmann 's nazi past " which appeared in the nation magazine in december 1998 .
throughout the investigation , the scholars had full access to the bertelsmann company archives as well as contact to historical witnesses such as reinhard mohn , the son of heinrich mohn , the company ’ s director during the third reich .
corporate archive open to public referring to the ihc 's investigation , thielen said , " this experience has reinforced for us why historical accuracy and transparency must be an integral part of our company ’ s core values , and we hope to serve as an example to other companies about the importance of this . "
" this has also shown us how , as one of the largest media companies in the world , we have a special responsibility to promote openness and public debate on these issues , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bertelsmann headquarters in gütersloh , germany , will be home to the commission 's evidence .
as a result of the ihc ’ s findings , thielen said that bertelsmann will now open an interim corporate archive on october 8th where the complete archives of the company 's corporate history will be open to the public .
the archive will be managed by a team of professional historians until march 31st , 2003 when the archives will be transferred to the bertelsmann foundation headquarters in gütersloh , where they will remain available to the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bertelsmann restructures thomas middelhoff ’ s successor at bertelsmann is a loyal company man who enjoys the type of trust from the influential mohn family middelhoff never did .

on monday the company was forced to face up to its wartime past after revelations surrounding the publisher ’ s activities surfaced in a 794-page report by the independent historical commission -lrb- ihc -rrb- , which had been called upon to investigate the company ’ s link to the nazis .
the ihc 's investigation uncovered contradictions in the company 's version of its wartime activities , as well as some unknown details that have now been exposed .
bertelsmann thrived under nazis the commission 's investigations showed that bertelsmann did not resist hitler and the third reich as previously reported by the company in its corporate reports , but instead thrived during world war ii by producing anti-semitic material and nazi propaganda .
according to the ihc report , the traditional family-run publishing house was motivated by financial profits to take on several printing contracts given by the nazi government .
within just a few years , bertelsmann grew to become the largest book producer for the german army during the war , publishing some 19 million editions .
most of the publications were brochures and pamphlets intended to strengthen the morale and courage of soldiers on the front , but many of the works also contained extreme derogatory texts about foreigners and jews .
in addition , the ihc study reveals that although bertelsmann itself was not directly involved in employing nazi slave labourers , several of the company ’ s printing houses in vilnius , lithuania , relied on cheap jewish labourers from the local ghetto to run their presses .
the commission also adds that it is very likely that nazi slave labourers were used in associated printing houses in riga , latvia .
end of a company legend until the historical commission began investigating the company ’ s history in the late 1990s , bertelsmann had always maintained its historically active role in the nazi resistance .
from 1945 on , the christian-based company claimed it had been shut down by the nazis for anti-government tendencies .
but the commission ’ s report indicates that this was a mere " legend " that had been invented by the company in order to receive a publishing license from the occupying forces as quickly as possible .
in reality , bertelsmann was closed in 1944 because it was found guilty of hoarding paper and could no longer turn a good profit .
official historical record " bertelsmann ag unreservedly accepts the independent historical commission 's report as the official record of the company 's history during the third reich , " said bertelsmann 's chief operating officer günter thielen in an official statement on the company 's web site .
" i would like to express our sincere regret for the inaccuracies the commission has uncovered in our previous corporate history of the world war ii era , as well as for the wartime activities that have been brought to light , " thielen said .
the independent historical commission , a group of four scholars , headed by university of california historian saul friedlander , worked on the report for over three years , painstakingly researching and documenting the company ’ s history under the nazi regime .
the commission was called upon by bertelsmann to investigate the company ’ s wartime era history following the publication of an article entitled " bertelsmann 's nazi past " which appeared in the nation magazine in december 1998 .
throughout the investigation , the scholars had full access to the bertelsmann company archives as well as contact to historical witnesses such as reinhard mohn , the son of heinrich mohn , the company ’ s director during the third reich .
corporate archive open to public referring to the ihc 's investigation , thielen said , " this experience has reinforced for us why historical accuracy and transparency must be an integral part of our company ’ s core values , and we hope to serve as an example to other companies about the importance of this . "
" this has also shown us how , as one of the largest media companies in the world , we have a special responsibility to promote openness and public debate on these issues , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bertelsmann headquarters in gütersloh , germany , will be home to the commission 's evidence .
as a result of the ihc ’ s findings , thielen said that bertelsmann will now open an interim corporate archive on october 8th where the complete archives of the company 's corporate history will be open to the public .
the archive will be managed by a team of professional historians until march 31st , 2003 when the archives will be transferred to the bertelsmann foundation headquarters in gütersloh , where they will remain available to the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bertelsmann restructures thomas middelhoff ’ s successor at bertelsmann is a loyal company man who enjoys the type of trust from the influential mohn family middelhoff never did .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair closing the book on small bookstores nigerian writer wins german peace prize book sales slump lithuanian authors feted at book fair business -pipe- 09.10.2002 opening a new chapter in the publishing industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stocking the shelves with hopeful bestsellers on oct .
9 , the world ’ s largest book fair opens in frankfurt .
but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .
and real book enthusiasts , publishers , book sellers and readers , for whom the book is more than just a simple product will again have the say . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the international book fair in frankfurt 2002 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the new prices will force spontaneous and business travelers to dig deeper into their pockets . germany 's national railway introduced a new pricing system on wednesday , which deutsche bahn hopes will get more people off the roads , out of the skies and back onto the tracks . “ rail travel for millions of people will cheaper than ever , ” bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn declared at a press conference in berlin . a complex pricing structure currently , rail tickets in germany are priced by distance - approximately 14 cents per kilometer .
nor are there any savings incentives for booking in advance . the system is n't terribly popular with the public , and train travel in germany fell by 4.4 percent in 2002 , according to an interim report released by the company in june .
deutsche bahn is hoping to reverse its fortunes with the new pricing system as well as a much-hyped new high-speed rail line connecting the major hub cities of cologne and frankfurt in just over an hour . the new system , which goes into effect on dec .
15 and is modelled after pricing mechanisms used by the airlines , creates an incentive for passengers to buy their tickets seven days or more in advance by offering them considerible savings if they do . like the airlines , deutsche bahn is betting the system will allow it to better fill empty seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn -lrb- left -rrb- bahn is calling the new system “ clear and transparent . ”
and mehdorn -lrb- photo , left -rrb- believes it is more logical and intuitive than what he describes as the current “ tariff jungle . ” “ at the moment we calculate prices by the kilometer , " deutsche bahn spokesman andreas fuhrmann said . " but it ’ s simply not clear for customers .
they don ’ t have a map by which they can measure the distances out ; it 's not easy to work out which ticket is the best value for thier money .
we want to make things easier for them with this new system . ” winners and losers families will be the biggest winners . children under 14 accompanied by their parents can travel free of charge .
under the old system , this offer only applied to children up to 6 years of age . but for spontaneous or business travelers who require flexibility , travel costs will increase significantly under the new system . travelers who can ’ t book in advance will , in many cases , be punished under the new pricing system . it also deals a heavy blow to holders of the company 's loyalty card , the " bahncard , " which currently entitles customers to a 50-percent discount off the standard fare , even if a ticket is purchased on the day of travel .
the card will continue to exist , but the annual subscription rate will drop to 60 euro -lrb- from the current 140 euro -rrb- and allow consumers to save between 25 percent and 50 percent , depending on how far in advance they book . customers who do not possess the bahncard and are able to plan their journeys in advance will be the biggest winners , reaping savings as high as 40 percent if they book seven days or more ahead , 25 percent three days before travel and 10 percent up to the day before travel . deutsche bahn is also hoping that by reducing the cost of long journeys it can lure customers away from budget air carriers or their cars . journeys of more than 180 kilometers will be up to 27 percent cheaper under the new system .
for example , a ticket between berlin and frankfurt will cost 86.40 euro - 19 percent cheaper than before . critics unimpressed despite support from the german government for its new pricing system , consumer groups are less enthusiastic about deutsche bahn 's new rules . walter hirrlinger , president of vdk , an organisation which represents and cares for war victims and pensioners in germany , called the reforms a " rip-off . "
the new pricing structure would hugely disadvantage the approximately 820,000 chronically sick , disabled and old people in germany who currently posses a bahn card entitling them to a 50 percent fare reduction , he declared in a statement issued on wednesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's super fast train set for take-off germany 's newly completed rail link between cologne and frankfurt could provide the impetus for a europe-wide high-speed rail network .

9 , the world ’ s largest book fair opens in frankfurt .
but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .
and real book enthusiasts , publishers , book sellers and readers , for whom the book is more than just a simple product will again have the say . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the international book fair in frankfurt 2002 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .

senior citizens are taking to the world wide web as the number of ' silver surfers ' soars . the over-50 's are logging on to the internet in surprisingly high numbers , according to a symposium on the ' silver surfer ' phenomenon held at frankfurt university .
the week long symposium , put together by the frankfurt-based senior citizens web site feierabend.com and deutsche telekom , has been organised to discuss the boom in sites aimed at the over-50 's .
it also reveals the increasing numbers who are using the internet for research and entertainment purposes .
in 1995 , three percent of net surfers were older than 50 years of age ; today that number has risen to 20 percent .
estimates suggest that by 2003 , a quarter of all internet surfers will be in the ' silver surfer ' age bracket .
germany is a country with an aging population .
the former christian social union 's minister for family ursula lehr , told the german wires , " we have more people over 60 than under 20 . "
in many areas , this will become problematic in the future , she said .
senior business boom for the specialist pages on the internet catering to senior citizens , that ’ s good news .
with over 4.5 million senior citizens online in germany , businesses are waking up to this previously untapped market .
internet businesses and e-commerce service providers have begun recognizing that senior citizens make for an especially lucrative clientele .
" at the moment , seniors account for a strong consumer sector , " said lehr who is also a certified gerontologist , a scientist that studies the biological , psychological , and sociological phenomena associated with aging .
a study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin shows that most seniors connected to the world wide web are able to spend up to 600 euro per person every month .
because many of them are bound to their homes , shopping online is a popular activity .
about 60 percent of wired seniors have already ordered something over the internet at least once , the study indicates .
special " silver surfer " sites bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii in the vatican chat room .
the explosion in pages catering to the interests of senior citizens , similar to feierabend.com , proves that there is a market on the internet for leisure time and information sites for the over-50 's .
regular services like news , entertainment and travel sites are all being tailored specifically for this new ' old ' generation of cyber surfers .
and once they are online , most give the pages their undivided attention .
compared to today ’ s youth , who quickly click to the newest interactive and animated sites once they lose patience , the older generation of slower more patient surfers tends to be more methodical in its use of the internet and ultimately gains more satisfaction from time online .
a study by british organization age concern shows that senior citizens use the internet very much like the younger generation , with the two sexes showing interest in varied subjects .
men prefer to use the internet to pursue hobbies and find out information , whereas women see the net as an alternative to the telephone , using it to chat with friends and families .
among both sexes , over-50 's are four times more likely to visit ancestry and genealogy sites than the average younger internet users , according to age concern 's research .
new quality of life the internet has given many a new lease on life , making it possible for housebound people and relatives of families divided by distance to keep in contact .
it is the perfect bridge to the outside world , an antidote to crippling loneliness and a practical tool for communicating with children and grandchildren .
it 's faster than an ordinary letter , and it gives older people a feeling of " keeping with the times " and remaining sprightly and mentally fit as one grows older .
almost all seniors agreed , that once they use the web they become hooked , with two-thirds agreeing that it had had a positive impact on their lives . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wired seniors storm the virtual world as germany wrings its hands over the lack of qualified computer specialists , a soaring number of its silver-haired citizens gets net-savvy .

9 , the world ’ s largest book fair opens in frankfurt .
but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .
and real book enthusiasts , publishers , book sellers and readers , for whom the book is more than just a simple product will again have the say . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the international book fair in frankfurt 2002 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the new prices will force spontaneous and business travelers to dig deeper into their pockets . germany 's national railway introduced a new pricing system on wednesday , which deutsche bahn hopes will get more people off the roads , out of the skies and back onto the tracks . “ rail travel for millions of people will cheaper than ever , ” bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn declared at a press conference in berlin . a complex pricing structure currently , rail tickets in germany are priced by distance - approximately 14 cents per kilometer .
nor are there any savings incentives for booking in advance . the system is n't terribly popular with the public , and train travel in germany fell by 4.4 percent in 2002 , according to an interim report released by the company in june .
deutsche bahn is hoping to reverse its fortunes with the new pricing system as well as a much-hyped new high-speed rail line connecting the major hub cities of cologne and frankfurt in just over an hour . the new system , which goes into effect on dec .
15 and is modelled after pricing mechanisms used by the airlines , creates an incentive for passengers to buy their tickets seven days or more in advance by offering them considerible savings if they do . like the airlines , deutsche bahn is betting the system will allow it to better fill empty seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn -lrb- left -rrb- bahn is calling the new system “ clear and transparent . ”

9 , the world ’ s largest book fair opens in frankfurt .
but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .
and real book enthusiasts , publishers , book sellers and readers , for whom the book is more than just a simple product will again have the say . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the international book fair in frankfurt 2002 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.10.2002 german rail introduces new price system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn executives hope lower prices will bring more people back to the rails with its new pricing system , deutsche bahn is hoping to get more people traveling by train in germany .
but the new prices will force spontaneous and business travelers to dig deeper into their pockets . germany 's national railway introduced a new pricing system on wednesday , which deutsche bahn hopes will get more people off the roads , out of the skies and back onto the tracks . “ rail travel for millions of people will cheaper than ever , ” bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn declared at a press conference in berlin . a complex pricing structure currently , rail tickets in germany are priced by distance - approximately 14 cents per kilometer .
nor are there any savings incentives for booking in advance . the system is n't terribly popular with the public , and train travel in germany fell by 4.4 percent in 2002 , according to an interim report released by the company in june .
deutsche bahn is hoping to reverse its fortunes with the new pricing system as well as a much-hyped new high-speed rail line connecting the major hub cities of cologne and frankfurt in just over an hour . the new system , which goes into effect on dec .
15 and is modelled after pricing mechanisms used by the airlines , creates an incentive for passengers to buy their tickets seven days or more in advance by offering them considerible savings if they do . like the airlines , deutsche bahn is betting the system will allow it to better fill empty seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn -lrb- left -rrb- bahn is calling the new system “ clear and transparent . ”
and mehdorn -lrb- photo , left -rrb- believes it is more logical and intuitive than what he describes as the current “ tariff jungle . ” “ at the moment we calculate prices by the kilometer , " deutsche bahn spokesman andreas fuhrmann said . " but it ’ s simply not clear for customers .
they don ’ t have a map by which they can measure the distances out ; it 's not easy to work out which ticket is the best value for thier money .
we want to make things easier for them with this new system . ” winners and losers families will be the biggest winners . children under 14 accompanied by their parents can travel free of charge .
under the old system , this offer only applied to children up to 6 years of age . but for spontaneous or business travelers who require flexibility , travel costs will increase significantly under the new system . travelers who can ’ t book in advance will , in many cases , be punished under the new pricing system . it also deals a heavy blow to holders of the company 's loyalty card , the " bahncard , " which currently entitles customers to a 50-percent discount off the standard fare , even if a ticket is purchased on the day of travel .
the card will continue to exist , but the annual subscription rate will drop to 60 euro -lrb- from the current 140 euro -rrb- and allow consumers to save between 25 percent and 50 percent , depending on how far in advance they book . customers who do not possess the bahncard and are able to plan their journeys in advance will be the biggest winners , reaping savings as high as 40 percent if they book seven days or more ahead , 25 percent three days before travel and 10 percent up to the day before travel . deutsche bahn is also hoping that by reducing the cost of long journeys it can lure customers away from budget air carriers or their cars . journeys of more than 180 kilometers will be up to 27 percent cheaper under the new system .
for example , a ticket between berlin and frankfurt will cost 86.40 euro - 19 percent cheaper than before . critics unimpressed despite support from the german government for its new pricing system , consumer groups are less enthusiastic about deutsche bahn 's new rules . walter hirrlinger , president of vdk , an organisation which represents and cares for war victims and pensioners in germany , called the reforms a " rip-off . "
the new pricing structure would hugely disadvantage the approximately 820,000 chronically sick , disabled and old people in germany who currently posses a bahn card entitling them to a 50 percent fare reduction , he declared in a statement issued on wednesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's super fast train set for take-off germany 's newly completed rail link between cologne and frankfurt could provide the impetus for a europe-wide high-speed rail network .

9 , the world ’ s largest book fair opens in frankfurt .
but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .

senior citizens are taking to the world wide web as the number of ' silver surfers ' soars . the over-50 's are logging on to the internet in surprisingly high numbers , according to a symposium on the ' silver surfer ' phenomenon held at frankfurt university .
the week long symposium , put together by the frankfurt-based senior citizens web site feierabend.com and deutsche telekom , has been organised to discuss the boom in sites aimed at the over-50 's .
it also reveals the increasing numbers who are using the internet for research and entertainment purposes .
in 1995 , three percent of net surfers were older than 50 years of age ; today that number has risen to 20 percent .
estimates suggest that by 2003 , a quarter of all internet surfers will be in the ' silver surfer ' age bracket .
germany is a country with an aging population .
the former christian social union 's minister for family ursula lehr , told the german wires , " we have more people over 60 than under 20 . "
in many areas , this will become problematic in the future , she said .
senior business boom for the specialist pages on the internet catering to senior citizens , that ’ s good news .
with over 4.5 million senior citizens online in germany , businesses are waking up to this previously untapped market .
internet businesses and e-commerce service providers have begun recognizing that senior citizens make for an especially lucrative clientele .
" at the moment , seniors account for a strong consumer sector , " said lehr who is also a certified gerontologist , a scientist that studies the biological , psychological , and sociological phenomena associated with aging .
a study by the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin shows that most seniors connected to the world wide web are able to spend up to 600 euro per person every month .
because many of them are bound to their homes , shopping online is a popular activity .

compared to today ’ s youth , who quickly click to the newest interactive and animated sites once they lose patience , the older generation of slower more patient surfers tends to be more methodical in its use of the internet and ultimately gains more satisfaction from time online .
a study by british organization age concern shows that senior citizens use the internet very much like the younger generation , with the two sexes showing interest in varied subjects .
men prefer to use the internet to pursue hobbies and find out information , whereas women see the net as an alternative to the telephone , using it to chat with friends and families .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 09.10.2002 german rail introduces new price system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn executives hope lower prices will bring more people back to the rails with its new pricing system , deutsche bahn is hoping to get more people traveling by train in germany .
but the new prices will force spontaneous and business travelers to dig deeper into their pockets . germany 's national railway introduced a new pricing system on wednesday , which deutsche bahn hopes will get more people off the roads , out of the skies and back onto the tracks . “ rail travel for millions of people will cheaper than ever , ” bahn chairman hartmut mehdorn declared at a press conference in berlin . a complex pricing structure currently , rail tickets in germany are priced by distance - approximately 14 cents per kilometer .
nor are there any savings incentives for booking in advance . the system is n't terribly popular with the public , and train travel in germany fell by 4.4 percent in 2002 , according to an interim report released by the company in june .
deutsche bahn is hoping to reverse its fortunes with the new pricing system as well as a much-hyped new high-speed rail line connecting the major hub cities of cologne and frankfurt in just over an hour . the new system , which goes into effect on dec .
15 and is modelled after pricing mechanisms used by the airlines , creates an incentive for passengers to buy their tickets seven days or more in advance by offering them considerible savings if they do . like the airlines , deutsche bahn is betting the system will allow it to better fill empty seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hartmut mehdorn -lrb- left -rrb- bahn is calling the new system “ clear and transparent . ”
and mehdorn -lrb- photo , left -rrb- believes it is more logical and intuitive than what he describes as the current “ tariff jungle . ” “ at the moment we calculate prices by the kilometer , " deutsche bahn spokesman andreas fuhrmann said . " but it ’ s simply not clear for customers .
they don ’ t have a map by which they can measure the distances out ; it 's not easy to work out which ticket is the best value for thier money .
we want to make things easier for them with this new system . ” winners and losers families will be the biggest winners . children under 14 accompanied by their parents can travel free of charge .
under the old system , this offer only applied to children up to 6 years of age . but for spontaneous or business travelers who require flexibility , travel costs will increase significantly under the new system . travelers who can ’ t book in advance will , in many cases , be punished under the new pricing system . it also deals a heavy blow to holders of the company 's loyalty card , the " bahncard , " which currently entitles customers to a 50-percent discount off the standard fare , even if a ticket is purchased on the day of travel .
the card will continue to exist , but the annual subscription rate will drop to 60 euro -lrb- from the current 140 euro -rrb- and allow consumers to save between 25 percent and 50 percent , depending on how far in advance they book . customers who do not possess the bahncard and are able to plan their journeys in advance will be the biggest winners , reaping savings as high as 40 percent if they book seven days or more ahead , 25 percent three days before travel and 10 percent up to the day before travel . deutsche bahn is also hoping that by reducing the cost of long journeys it can lure customers away from budget air carriers or their cars . journeys of more than 180 kilometers will be up to 27 percent cheaper under the new system .

9 , the world ’ s largest book fair opens in frankfurt .
but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .
fusion and market concentration despite the troubles in the overall german economy , the current crisis in the publishing industry is a natural outgrowth of a home-grown problem .
for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "
every publishing house , no matter what it ’ s traditional background , was busy printing as many books on as many topics as possible .
whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .
sales are dropping , and bookstores are overflowing with unsold books .
sigrid löffler , literary critic and publisher of the journal " literaturen " sees the current development with mixed views : " naturally , it ’ s bad when people buy fewer books .
but at the same time it ’ s absolutely necessary that we reduce this irrational overproduction of books on the german market . "
" there are simply too many books being published , non-essential books , unnecessary books , " löffler said speaking to dw-radio .
fewer , but better books ?
is the necessary response then fewer but better books ?
several publishing houses seem to have adopted this as their new production tactic .
the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "
fiction works and novels , like jonathan franzen ’ s the corrections and günter grass ’ crab ’ s walk , were the company ’ s two top bestsellers .
throughout the industry , publishers like s.fischer are embracing a new magic formula : get back to the core values and concentrate on what you do best .
for giant media corporations like bertelsmann , this means returning to book publishing .
for newspapers , it means selling their smaller affiliated publishing houses and refocusing on news media .
expensive book fair not even the world ’ s largest book fair has been spared the economic downsizing of germany ’ s publishing landscape .
this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .
for some in the branch this development is positive .
it means creativity will return to the agenda .
and real book enthusiasts , publishers , book sellers and readers , for whom the book is more than just a simple product will again have the say . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the international book fair in frankfurt 2002 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

this year 15 percent fewer german publishers and booksellers signed up as official representatives at the trade fair , the lowest number to attend the event in years .
the high price of hosting a stand as well as the expensive hotel costs in frankfurt kept many away , says volker neumann , the new director of the book fair .
the usually high number of visitors has also declined this year , says neumann , who is concerned about a downward trend .
already last year there were 15 percent fewer visitors than in previous years , but this was largely due to september 11 .
in order to get the numbers up again , the book fair needs to be more firmly rooted in the public conscious , neumann says .
in an interview with dw-radio , neumann explains how the book fair can attract more attention by becoming market-oriented .
" we have to find strategic partners and form economic alliances with larger companies such as the deutsche bahn ag , with whom we ’ ve cooperated in the past " he says .
creating a new profile the book fair also needs to redefine its profile as a fair for and about books .
for neumann this means continuing to focus on the guest countries , a feature his predecessor wanted to cancel .
this year ’ s featured country , lithuania , is comparatively small and its literary tradition fairly obscure , but next year neumann intends to draw a lot more attention with russia .
in the future , the book fair will also concentrate on special thematic highlights , such as this year ’ s series of podium discussions under the title " bridges for a world divided " which is intended to engage visitors in a dialogue on the role of books in cultural understanding .
like the book fair , the entire publishing industry will have to re-examine itself and find a course that attracts people back to books and reading .
the next few months will be a turbulent time of restructuring as long-standing companies refocus themselves to adapt to the new market situation .

but for the german publishing industry , the five day event is anything but a cause for celebration as exhibitors choose to stay home amid declining sales . long a country of avid book readers , or at least book buyers , germany is now facing a critical drop in annual book sales .
according to the german publishers ’ and booksellers ’ association , sales this year have declined by four percent .
hardest hit is the non-fiction sector ; the market for self-help and advice books has shrunk rapidly within the last few months .
and that ’ s bad news for a division that was accustomed to hefty and continuous growth .

for years , german publishers worked according to the motto " the more books , the better . "

whoever couldn ’ t keep up with the competition went under .
and those publishers who refused to close up shop completely sought protection under a larger mother house .
but now the days of surplus have come to an end .

the traditional s.fischer verlag , for example , has reduced its output in the last two years by 25 percent , and to great success according to the company ’ s sales figures .
the publisher , like many others , has profited primarily from the rediscovery of the " good book . "

on monday the company was forced to face up to its wartime past after revelations surrounding the publisher ’ s activities surfaced in a 794-page report by the independent historical commission -lrb- ihc -rrb- , which had been called upon to investigate the company ’ s link to the nazis .
the ihc 's investigation uncovered contradictions in the company 's version of its wartime activities , as well as some unknown details that have now been exposed .
bertelsmann thrived under nazis the commission 's investigations showed that bertelsmann did not resist hitler and the third reich as previously reported by the company in its corporate reports , but instead thrived during world war ii by producing anti-semitic material and nazi propaganda .
according to the ihc report , the traditional family-run publishing house was motivated by financial profits to take on several printing contracts given by the nazi government .
within just a few years , bertelsmann grew to become the largest book producer for the german army during the war , publishing some 19 million editions .
most of the publications were brochures and pamphlets intended to strengthen the morale and courage of soldiers on the front , but many of the works also contained extreme derogatory texts about foreigners and jews .
in addition , the ihc study reveals that although bertelsmann itself was not directly involved in employing nazi slave labourers , several of the company ’ s printing houses in vilnius , lithuania , relied on cheap jewish labourers from the local ghetto to run their presses .
the commission also adds that it is very likely that nazi slave labourers were used in associated printing houses in riga , latvia .
end of a company legend until the historical commission began investigating the company ’ s history in the late 1990s , bertelsmann had always maintained its historically active role in the nazi resistance .
from 1945 on , the christian-based company claimed it had been shut down by the nazis for anti-government tendencies .
but the commission ’ s report indicates that this was a mere " legend " that had been invented by the company in order to receive a publishing license from the occupying forces as quickly as possible .
in reality , bertelsmann was closed in 1944 because it was found guilty of hoarding paper and could no longer turn a good profit .
official historical record " bertelsmann ag unreservedly accepts the independent historical commission 's report as the official record of the company 's history during the third reich , " said bertelsmann 's chief operating officer günter thielen in an official statement on the company 's web site .
" i would like to express our sincere regret for the inaccuracies the commission has uncovered in our previous corporate history of the world war ii era , as well as for the wartime activities that have been brought to light , " thielen said .
the independent historical commission , a group of four scholars , headed by university of california historian saul friedlander , worked on the report for over three years , painstakingly researching and documenting the company ’ s history under the nazi regime .
the commission was called upon by bertelsmann to investigate the company ’ s wartime era history following the publication of an article entitled " bertelsmann 's nazi past " which appeared in the nation magazine in december 1998 .
throughout the investigation , the scholars had full access to the bertelsmann company archives as well as contact to historical witnesses such as reinhard mohn , the son of heinrich mohn , the company ’ s director during the third reich .
corporate archive open to public referring to the ihc 's investigation , thielen said , " this experience has reinforced for us why historical accuracy and transparency must be an integral part of our company ’ s core values , and we hope to serve as an example to other companies about the importance of this . "
" this has also shown us how , as one of the largest media companies in the world , we have a special responsibility to promote openness and public debate on these issues , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bertelsmann headquarters in gütersloh , germany , will be home to the commission 's evidence .
as a result of the ihc ’ s findings , thielen said that bertelsmann will now open an interim corporate archive on october 8th where the complete archives of the company 's corporate history will be open to the public .
the archive will be managed by a team of professional historians until march 31st , 2003 when the archives will be transferred to the bertelsmann foundation headquarters in gütersloh , where they will remain available to the public . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bertelsmann restructures thomas middelhoff ’ s successor at bertelsmann is a loyal company man who enjoys the type of trust from the influential mohn family middelhoff never did .

a scottish parliament committee has asked the justice minister to think again after he rejected calls to specify the hue of blue which should be used on the saltire .
jim wallace argued that such a move would " create more difficulties than it might solve " . "
as long as it is blue , that is all that is required under the laws of arms in scotland " romilly squire his stance was supported by romilly squire , the chairman of the heraldry society of scotland .
the society was created 25 years ago to promote the study of heraldry and encourage its correct use north of the border .
mr squire told bbc scotland that it was " completely pointless " to waste time on specifying the exact shade of blue of the st andrew 's cross .
" as long as it is blue , that is all that is required under the laws of arms in scotland , " he said .
however , he added : " they could legislate on a much more important aspect of the saltire .
array of blues " that is its abuse by corporate bodies , advertisers , etc , using the national flag as a basis for advertising and other displays of corporate identity . "
the issue was initially raised by edinburgh man george reid after he became fed up seeing the saltire paraded in an array of blues .
he petitioned the scottish parliament , asking it to lay down one standard colour .
the petitions committee backed his calls and put pressure on mr wallace to specify the exact shade to be used on the flag .
he wrote back saying that such a law would be expensive and difficult to enforce .
" the issue of guidance or the introductions of regulations on this matter are unnecessary in my view and would create more difficulties than they might solve , " he wrote .
however , the committee said mr wallace should think again about the issue .
msps insisted he should at least fix a recommended shade for flag manufacturers and others so that all scottish flags could start out the same colour .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- tales from japan 's ' golden recession ' news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : business news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business e-commerce economy market data entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk wednesday , 9 october , 2002 , 05:47 gmt 06:47 uk tales from japan 's ' golden recession ' kyoko and akihiko worry about saving for the future by emma clark bbc news online business reporter for a decade , japan 's economy has stagnated , leaving its people anxious but strangely resilient .
the election of prime minister junichiro koizumi last year brought hope for many , but the new broom has so far proved a disappointment .
bbc news online interviewed a cross-section of people from japan and discovered conflicting undercurrents of feeling .
the " golden recession " has spawned needling doubts , worries about money , a yearning for change and grim anecdotes about subway suicides .
click below for the individual stories : the married couple the student the sales manager the foreigner the housewife the working woman the academic the consultant the married couple kyoko and akihiko ebashi are married with two children .
kyoko , aged 37 , has worked as a teacher and part-time for an accountancy company , but now she looks after the children .
we are saving money for when my husband retires and because the economy is getting worse .
maybe our stupid government will not be able to afford to support elderly people then .
we also have to spend money on education for the children .
the japanese love to educate themselves and it costs a lot of money , even at kindergarten .
kyoko worries about educating her children we bought our condominium with a very big loan , but the interest is low .
right now the economy is going down and interest is going down also .
we spend money on houses because there is no interest for savings in the bank .
i also think our insurance policy is not safe now - we are wondering if we will lose a lot of money if the company collapses .
there is always a rumour that some company is going to ruin .
people are not depressed , but mothers are coming down hard on their children .
they want them to study hard , otherwise they might not get jobs because of the economy .
when i was a child it was very difficult to find a homeless person near my house - now they are everywhere kyoko ebashi some say the government is giving up on policy and wants to be in the middle .
sometimes the middle is nice , but sometimes you need radical change .
but japan does n't like to change .
they want business as usual .
when i was a child it was very difficult to find a homeless person near my house .
now they are everywhere .
one of the first words children learn is the japanese word for " homeless " .
they are not energetic like the homeless in new york , who want money .
they are just lying down and sitting still .
kyoko 's husband akihiko is a 39-year old banker .
at this moment i do n't know what the future will hold .
the working situation is getting tougher than before - people are worried .
companies have been recruiting less graduates than before and making retirement mandatory .
there must be some solution but many people are struggling to solve the problems akihiko ebashi this is the japanese way .
it is not very drastic like american companies that lay off many employees .
the current economic problems are very serious .
there must be some solution but many people are struggling to solve the problems , including politicians , economists and leaders of companies .
there 's some feeling that the economy is maybe changing in some way because mr koizumi has been trying to do many things .
we do not see good results at the moment , but he 's trying very hard .
click here to return to the top the student kiichiro kanai is a 24-year old student , who is currently living in the netherlands .
he is studying for a diploma in accountancy and international business .
it is funny to think about people suffering from the economic slump .
no money for travelling to hawaii ?
no money to buy gadgets ?
no money to go to karaoke ?
if you go to japan , it does n't look different at all , it still looks super-modern .
the japanese are perfectionist people - they feel pressure and if they ca n't get it perfect , they commit suicide kiichiro kanai you hear about the recession but the quality of life is still good .
yes , it might be difficult to get jobs at very prominent companies , but there are still so many small and medium-sized companies to work for .
my father lost his holiday company because he had a lot of loans and the government wanted to improve the banking situation .
but now he is running another business , selling golf memberships .
there are many depressed people in clinics everywhere .
in tokyo i used to take the subway to college , and you could hear people killing themselves once in a while .
it was absolutely related to the economic problems .
you have to understand the culture : the japanese are perfectionist people .
they feel pressure and if they ca n't get it perfect , they commit suicide .
many middle-aged men get sacked and have nowhere to go .
they never anticipated it and because of pride , they commit suicide .
click here to return to the top the sales manager aki harada works for a relocation company , catering to ex-pats in tokyo .
he is 34 this month , and is married with no children .
the business is getting worse because less ex-pats are moving here .
clients are also trying to get cheaper prices .
many of our clients are banks and because their business is bad , it affects us .
aki says the economy does not worry him i 'm not worried - there are bad things on the television , but it does n't affect my personal life .
we have just bought a house in tokyo - it was a good chance to get tax back from the government .
before i worked for a bread-making company .
i quit my job to learn english , but now people would think twice about doing that .
one of my friends did n't have a job for one and a half years .
i do n't know if he was depressed - i did n't ask - that would be too personal .
i support the prime minister and i vote for him .
click here to return to the top the foreigner steve koya , aged 33 , is british but married to a japanese woman .
he works in hokkaido as computer systems manager for a concrete producer .
after graduating , i ended up forming a company with a japanese friend .
but japanese people have a certain way of doing things .
my business partner was not prepared to take any risks , he just wanted to pay the wages every month .
steve says the japanese have saved too much so i left my partner to get on with it .
there have been problems in my current company , with moving forward .
the vice president is very , very different from the typical japanese - he spent four years working in new york .
but the company directors are old guys who have been there for years .
they are happy to spend money on expensive equipment , but not on software or computer systems to streamline the company .
this year particularly has seen a huge slump in government-funded construction projects , or rather the extension of them .
around us every day , other less fortunate concrete companies go bankrupt .
they are happy to spend money on expensive equipment , but not on software or computer systems to streamline the company steve koya it 's hard to believe there is a recession at the moment .
you go to any japanese city and at the heart of it is the shopping centre , and it 's bubbling .
the japanese have so much money saved up , that it has n't affected them at all .
it 's like a perpetual safety blanket .
until it starts hurting , they are not going to do much about it .
click here to return to the top the housewife noriko kimura used to temp in tokyo , but now stays at home to look after her baby .
she is married to donald , who works in computers .
so many people have been made redundant .
i get really worried about donald losing his job .
he is earning enough money , but he is getting older .
noriko worries about her husband losing his job if his company has problems , they might think : ' that guy is earning too much , we can cut him ' .
there is more temping now as it is difficult to find permanent jobs .
before when i was looking for a job , everyone would ask if i was going to have a baby because i was a woman .
we are careful about spending and we do n't eat out so much these days .
we bought an apartment this year so it is difficult to save .
donald has a bank account in euros because it is safer than yen and there is more interest .
click here to return to the top the working woman yuko furuya , aged 42 and unmarried , has worked for seven years at fujitsu-siemens .
because of the worldwide economic slump , my annual salary has n't increased much in the last few years .
before it was better .
i worry about the future when i get old .
i worry if i get sick and i do n't have enough pension .
the government is trying to do something , but i do n't think it is doing well .
yuko is disillusioned by the prime minister i wish the prime minister would do something for the citizens .
in the 1980s there was more business and therefore people worked more and spent more .
now the bubble has broken .
there is not enough business and therefore many people have been fired or they are getting less salary .
there is also a contrast between people on the poor side and some people who are getting lots of money .
click here to return to the top the academic robert ridge , aged 51 , is a professor at the international christian university in tokyo .
he grew up in the uk , but finished his education in australia .
he is married to a japanese woman and has three children .
generally speaking foreigners are very well respected here .
strangely , however , banks will simply not lend money to foreigners .
when i applied for a car loan at my local bank , i was refused .
as a foreigner , robert could n't get a car loan however , when my japanese wife - who is unemployed - applied , she was given the loan because her husband has a permanent job .
some call it the " golden recession " here because it has n't had any visible impact on japan .
but gradually it is getting worse and worse .
students are having problems getting jobs and people are getting laid off .
my wife says mr koizumi is a big wimp robert ridge the wages are not very good either .
most people earn 1,000 yen -lrb- £ 5 ; $ 8 -rrb- an hour for an ordinary job .
people do n't spend as much anymore .
my wife says the 50 yen shop is now popular -lrb- it used to be a 100 yen shop -rrb- .
we have n't decided whether to retire in japan - it depends on the value of the yen .
the japanese people are patient in all facets of life .
things go on and on for years and then suddenly masses of changes happen .
but i 'm not holding my breath .
my wife says mr koizumi is a big wimp .
although he was initially seen as independent , he 's still terribly weak-kneed and he 's not making any progress .
click here to return to the top the consultant kazuhiko yamashita , aged 43 and unmarried , is a part-time consultant for the construction industry .
our prime minister junichiro koizumi says : ' no economic growth without reformation of our society ' .
i agree with him , but i feel reformation is still so difficult .
i believe there should be more independence for local government , less bureaucracy and increasing mobility of labour .
we are suffering from deflation - the prices of goods are decreasing a lot .
kazuhiko thinks japan needs a strong leader it looks nice but people are very nervous to spend money because you do n't know what their income will be in two or three years .
my brothers and i support my father financially .
my parents - 70 and 76 - are optimistic because they do n't think they will live long .
but they worry about our lives and their grandsons .
now that i am 43 years old , i worry about my pension plan and my money when i am retired .
there is a very low birth rate in my society and we often talk about that issue .
maybe we japanese have to accept immigrants from abroad , like the uk does .
i like mr koizumi , but the other people who surround him in the liberal democratic party are too conservative .
it is a very old-fashioned and out-of-date party .
we would welcome someone like margaret thatcher - she 's a very aggressive , iron lady .
we need that kind of person in japan , we need a strong leader .

i wish the prime minister would do something for the citizens .
in the 1980s there was more business and therefore people worked more and spent more .
now the bubble has broken .
there is not enough business and therefore many people have been fired or they are getting less salary .
there is also a contrast between people on the poor side and some people who are getting lots of money .
the academic robert ridge , aged 51 , is a professor at the international christian university in tokyo .
he grew up in the uk , but finished his education in australia .
he is married to a japanese woman and has three children .
generally speaking foreigners are very well respected here .
strangely , however , banks will simply not lend money to foreigners .
when i applied for a car loan at my local bank , i was refused .
however , when my japanese wife - who is unemployed - applied , she was given the loan because her husband has a permanent job .
some call it the " golden recession " here because it has n't had any visible impact on japan .
but gradually it is getting worse and worse .
students are having problems getting jobs and people are getting laid off . "
my wife says mr koizumi is a big wimp " robert ridge the wages are not very good either .
most people earn 1,000 yen -lrb- £ 5 ; $ 8 -rrb- an hour for an ordinary job .
people do n't spend as much anymore .
my wife says the 50 yen shop is now popular -lrb- it used to be a 100 yen shop -rrb- .
we have n't decided whether to retire in japan - it depends on the value of the yen .
the japanese people are patient in all facets of life .
things go on and on for years and then suddenly masses of changes happen .
but i 'm not holding my breath .
my wife says mr koizumi is a big wimp .
although he was initially seen as independent , he 's still terribly weak-kneed and he 's not making any progress .
the consultant kazuhiko yamashita , aged 43 and unmarried , is a part-time consultant for the construction industry .
our prime minister junichiro koizumi says : ' no economic growth without reformation of our society ' .
i agree with him , but i feel reformation is still so difficult .
i believe there should be more independence for local government , less bureaucracy and increasing mobility of labour .
we are suffering from deflation - the prices of goods are decreasing a lot .
it looks nice but people are very nervous to spend money because you do n't know what their income will be in two or three years .
my brothers and i support my father financially .
my parents - 70 and 76 - are optimistic because they do n't think they will live long .
but they worry about our lives and their grandsons .
now that i am 43 years old , i worry about my pension plan and my money when i am retired .
there is a very low birth rate in my society and we often talk about that issue .
maybe we japanese have to accept immigrants from abroad , like the uk does .
i like mr koizumi , but the other people who surround him in the liberal democratic party are too conservative .
it is a very old-fashioned and out-of-date party .
we would welcome someone like margaret thatcher - she 's a very aggressive , iron lady .
we need that kind of person in japan , we need a strong leader .

the richard commission has confirmed a deadline next summer for submission of evidence from parties in wales - after the may assembly elections .
the liberal democrats - labour 's coalition partners - have accused labour of being split over upgrading the assembly 's powers to match those of the scottish parliament .
plaid cymru president ieuan wyn jones said the commission 's credibility had been " seriously undermined " and accused labour of " running scared " from the real issues .
and leader of the conservatives in the assembly nick bourne said labour 's request process was " extraordinary " and he accused first minister rhodri morgan of showing a " lack of leadership " .
the commission was set to draw a close to the submissions process at the end of october , but labour asked for the delayed deadline , fuelling speculation about party divisions .
but welsh labour has said it wanted a delay in order to carry out an all-member consultation .
lord richard - a former labour cabinet minister - will be reviewing exactly how the three-year-old assembly operates and its election process .
the body met for the first time at the end of september , when former welsh secretary ron davies - dubbed the architect of devolution - gave evidence , claiming the structure of the assembly was " creaking " .
the lib dems accused mr davies of " fudging " the assembly 's powers and said labour was " brushing under the carpet " divisions of boosting the assembly 's powers .
now political parties now have until july to submit their evidence .
' hiding divisions ' welsh liberal democrat president rob humphreys said : " the inadequacy of the assembly 's powers is a difficult issue for labour .
" some of their mps are still firmly opposed to any devolution whereas some of their ams are all for the same powers as the scottish parliament .
" no wonder labour wants to brush the issue under the carpet , hiding its divisions until after may 's elections . "
in his commission evidence , mr davies said 60 members would not be enough for the assembly to be able to handle more powers , and suggested the possibility of 80 constituency-based seats in wales and fewer mps at westminster .
commission timetable the letter informing the commission members of the request for a delay came from the commission secretary , carys evans .
it stated : " i am writing to let you know that the commission has received a request from the welsh labour party to submit its evidence after the assembly elections next year .
" the commission has agreed to this and has asked me to write to the other political parties represented in the assembly to offer them the same timetable if that is how they wish to proceed .
" i have suggested a deadline of 15 july for submissions to be received in order to allow sufficient time for the commission to consider it before formulating its conclusions in the autumn of 2003 . "
a later statement , said : " the richard commission has not yet published a consultation timetable .
" it 's not the case that anyone has sought an extension to a deadline because none has been set .
" the commission is not favouring anyone on this - it has offered exactly the same timetable to the other political parties .

more than 15,000 seals have died in european waters over the past five months from the morbillivirus , which attacks the seal 's immune system .
the discovery is the first confirmation of the infection in a seal in ireland during the current epidemic .
hundreds of seals died along the county down coast during the last epidemic in 1988 .
earlier this year , common seals in europe succumbed to a virus which killed thousands of them 14 years ago .
more than 1,400 dead seals were found along the coasts of scandinavia and the netherlands in the two months to july .
the disease , phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- , attacked the animals ' respiratory systems .
researchers believed few seals in the affected area had acquired immunity to pdv from the 1988 epidemic .
the 1988 epidemic killed more than 18,000 european common seals , including some in uk waters .
measles populations affected included those in orkney and the moray firth in scotland and the wash , in eastern england , where about half the seals died .
the disease appeared in the uk about four months after being found in denmark .
grey seals - which are more abundant than common seals - were also exposed to pdv in 1988 , though few died .
they are thought able to carry the virus .
pdv is a morbillivirus , of the same family as measles , and related to canine distemper .
it attacks the white blood cells , which become more susceptible to chance infections .

however , statisticians at imperial college london say that there should be no extra threat to human health , despite almost twice as many infected carcasses entering the food chain . "
our intention is to eradicate bse across the eu " professor christl donnelly , imperial college eating bse-infected meat is firmly thought to be the cause of the fatal human disease vcjd .
so far , well over 100 people have been diagnosed with the illness , and the majority of these have already died .
the government put in place a programme of culling in order to stop older cattle - more likely to carry bse - from being eaten .
earlier research into the epidemic suggested that approximately one million cattle had been infected , 870,000 of which entered the food chain .
screening clue the imperial research , published in a royal society journal , used the results of a recent mass screening of cattle to check original estimates .
its authors now say that it is likely that as many as 1.9 million were infected , and that 1.6 million were turned into human food .
this means individual exposure to infected meat was more or less double previous estimates .
there are concerns that vcjd may incubate for an unknown number of years before causing illness - and this is making it difficult for experts to predict roughly how many humans will develop the disease .
however , professor christl donnelly , who led the latest research , said the extra exposure did not mean that there were now likely to be many more cases of vcjd .
she said : " if cigarette companies suddenly announced that cigarettes actually contained twice as much tar as they had been saying , it would not mean that many more people would die from tobacco-related diseases .
" what it would mean is that tar was much less dangerous than previously thought . "
under-reporting she said that , in the same way , her findings meant that bse-infected meat was likely to be less infectious to humans than previously thought .
she said there were two possible explanations for the large disparity between the two figures .
one was that farmers were deliberately not reporting cases of bse developing in their herds , reducing the official number of infected animals .
the other was that cattle at the very earliest stages of bse illness might not obviously have " mad cow disease " , but have other symptoms - such as a drop in fertility or milk production - which would mark them out for early slaughter as part of normal farming practice .
she said that a combination of both factors seemed probable .
however , the results do suggest that the bse epidemic in the uk is well and truly over .
falling away the team 's estimates for the number of infected animals entering the food supply has been falling since a peak in 1989 , and this year , it was likely that no infected animal had been slaughtered for meat .
however , professor donnelly 's analysis of the prospects for other eu countries makes slightly less comfortable reading .
italy and belgium , for example , have slightly higher bse infection rates among their herds , data suggest .
professor donnelly said that this did not yet constitute a major problem , but should serve as a " wake-up call " to keep on the look-out for the disease .
she said : " after all , our intention is to eradicate bse across the eu . "
a spokesman for the food standards agency said that the study suggested that measures taken in 1996 - after the emergence of vcjd - had proved effective .

however , statisticians at imperial college london say that there should be no extra threat to human health , despite almost twice as many infected carcasses entering the food chain .
our intention is to eradicate bse across the eu professor christl donnelly , imperial college eating bse-infected meat is firmly thought to be the cause of the fatal human disease vcjd .
so far , well over 100 people have been diagnosed with the illness , and the majority of these have already died .
the government put in place a programme of culling in order to stop older cattle - more likely to carry bse - from being eaten .
earlier research into the epidemic suggested that approximately one million cattle had been infected , 870,000 of which entered the food chain .
screening clue the imperial research , published in a royal society journal , used the results of a recent mass screening of cattle to check original estimates .
its authors now say that it is likely that as many as 1.9 million were infected , and that 1.6 million were turned into human food .
measures to protect from infection were introduced this means individual exposure to infected meat was more or less double previous estimates .
there are concerns that vcjd may incubate for an unknown number of years before causing illness - and this is making it difficult for experts to predict roughly how many humans will develop the disease .
however , professor christl donnelly , who led the latest research , said the extra exposure did not mean that there were now likely to be many more cases of vcjd .
she said : " if cigarette companies suddenly announced that cigarettes actually contained twice as much tar as they had been saying , it would not mean that many more people would die from tobacco-related diseases .
" what it would mean is that tar was much less dangerous than previously thought . "
under-reporting she said that , in the same way , her findings meant that bse-infected meat was likely to be less infectious to humans than previously thought .
she said there were two possible explanations for the large disparity between the two figures .
one was that farmers were deliberately not reporting cases of bse developing in their herds , reducing the official number of infected animals .
the other was that cattle at the very earliest stages of bse illness might not obviously have " mad cow disease " , but have other symptoms - such as a drop in fertility or milk production - which would mark them out for early slaughter as part of normal farming practice .
she said that a combination of both factors seemed probable .
however , the results do suggest that the bse epidemic in the uk is well and truly over .
falling away the team 's estimates for the number of infected animals entering the food supply has been falling since a peak in 1989 , and this year , it was likely that no infected animal had been slaughtered for meat .
however , professor donnelly 's analysis of the prospects for other eu countries makes slightly less comfortable reading .
italy and belgium , for example , have slightly higher bse infection rates among their herds , data suggest .
professor donnelly said that this did not yet constitute a major problem , but should serve as a " wake-up call " to keep on the look-out for the disease .
she said : " after all , our intention is to eradicate bse across the eu . "
a spokesman for the food standards agency said that the study suggested that measures taken in 1996 - after the emergence of vcjd - had proved effective .
there is an ongoing review of the policy of slaughtering cattle over 30 months of age , and the agency said that the findings would be considered as part of this . watch / listen on this story prof. christl donnelly , imperial college london " eating beef in this country is safer than it has been for 20 years " see also : 04 oct 02 -pipe- england cjd victim asked ' ever eaten pet food ?

the final charter will set targets to increase black participation in the industry .
" use it or lose it " is the message for mining houses with extensive privately-owned ore reserve not being developed .
all mineral rights now have to be registered with the state and any company which is n't mining risks losing its reserves to rivals , among them many aspirant black-owned mining companies .
the whole mining industry now has accepted the idea of mineral rights under the custodianship of the state alan fine , anglogold the draft charter had been keenly contested by many including anglo platinum - the world 's biggest platinum producer - which was planning a legal challenge to the new law until a few days ago .
other big , traditionally white-owned companies , such as anglogold , seem to be less worried about the charter .
' achievable targets ' a draft version of the charter , setting targets for the sale of mining assets to black businesses , was leaked earlier this year and unnerved investors .
anglogold public affairs manager , alan fine , described the targets set out in the leaked charter as " unmeetable " and said it had created misunderstandings within the industry .
but mr fine told the bbc 's world business report his company is quite confident targets set out in the final version will be achievable .
" the whole mining industry now has accepted the idea of mineral rights under the custodianship of the state , " he said .
and anglo american platinum chief executive barry davison , who was heavily involved in negotiations , had described the final document as " a satisfactory compromise between government 's political imperatives and the commercial realities of the industry " .
common agenda phumzile mlambo-ngcuka , south africa 's minister of mining and energy , told the bbc 's world business report there is nothing in the governments plans that will frustrate industry in any way .
" we need industry , industry we think needs us , so we want a common agenda as much as possible , " she said " we want to retain the traditional white mining companies , we want very strong black economic empowerment and we want foreign investors , and we do n't see a contradiction there .
" we would expect them to take black partners into their business going forward so that in that way we bring in blacks into the mining industry .
