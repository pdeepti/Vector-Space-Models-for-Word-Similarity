in fact , he 's rather proud of it .
which is why his latest series , jeremy clarkson meets the neighbours , apparently makes hilarious viewing .
clarkson : time to meet the neighbours armed with little more than his prejudices , and the obligatory fast car , jeremy heads off to continental europe .
after a series of near-death experiences on the roads of paris , he discovers he quite likes the french , really .
and the belgians are ok .
but his views on the spanish and the germans are almost unrepeatable .
this morning , jeremy came on to breakfast to explain more about the series click here to see jeremy clarkson 's interview in full the idea of the series is that he zooms through various european countries in an e-type jaguar in search of answers to questions such as " are the dutch a bunch of dope smoking pornographers ? , do the germans have a sense of humour " and " is there anything interesting about the belgians ? "
over the course of five programmes , clarkson covers 20,000 miles in what the programme 's publicity describe as " an informative and entertaining 20,000 mile road trip around europe to put age-old stereotypes to the test " .
in the first programme , he describes the french as a bunch of " onion selling ne 'er-do-wells " , his aim being to find out why they seem to appear so smug .
the series is described as not being about serious investigation and many people might find the programme offensive as clarkson enjoys himself while poking fun at " johnny foreigner " .
he soon begins to understand why when he sails on the world 's biggest race yacht and discovers that the days when the british ruled the waves are long gone .
and it 's not just on water that the french seem to excel as jeremy meets real-life spiderman alain robert , who has been free-climbing the world 's tallest buildings for over 25 years .
this frenchman 's passion has taken him to terrifying heights , yet he admits to jeremy that he suffers from terrible vertigo .
walking around paris , jeremy notices that the french just ooze style and he decides it 's about time he paid a visit to the paris school of seduction , where he is given a complete makeover by the school 's headmistress .

her comments on bbc one 's question time programme come a week after prime minister tony blair defended the decision to take the money . "
i do think that the committee has been established because of the embarrassment over that affair " clare short ms short also , however , accused the media of wrongly suggesting there was corruption in all gifts .
on tuesday , labour set up a new committee to vet future donations but denied the move was sparked by the controversy over mr desmond 's gift .
but ms short said : " i do think that the committee has been established because of the embarrassment over that affair . "
the £ 100,000 gift from mr desmond , who owns magazines like asian babes and horny housewives as well as express newspapers , angered some labour rank-and-file members .
' i hate porn ' on thursday 's programme , ms short was asked by david dimbleby : " do you think it was right that richard desmond 's money was accepted ? "
the minister replied : " no .
i hate porn , though if you look at the list of the 10 richest men in britain , four or five made their money from porn .
" it 's a kind of rather horrible reflection on how much consumption of it there is . "
ms short said she was proud of some of the moves her party her made on political funding , such as introducing transparency and national limits .
the public should not be asked to give more state funding to political parties , she argued .
" we have got to try to reduce what we spend on politics and keep our politics as clean as possible , " ms short continued .
cutting innuendo " i think this committee has been established to try to be more ethical about what the labour party accepts .
" we are in a dilemma here .
we have opened it up and now everyone thinks everything we do is absolutely grotty - and it 's not - but we will have to go on and do better . "
labour says its new committee is designed to cut out the " innuendo " which has surrounded recent donations but denies any past wrongdoing .
the new six-member fundraising committee will oversee any gift of more than £ 5,000 .
democratic rights labour chairman charles clarke on tuesday declined to say whether the committee would have accepted mr desmond donations .
but he admitted labour had been put onto the " back foot " by recent funding rows .
" the most important moral standard is that people should not expect that in giving money to the labour party they are getting some favour in return , " said mr clarke .
that included people looking for honours and government contracts , he said .
mr clarke said labour was not going to draw up a list of types of organisations from whom it will not accept money .
instead , the committee would decide on each donation on a case by case basis .
dracula analogy the conservatives have instead called for an independent commission to examine claims of corruption in government .
labour fundraiser lord levy , mr blair 's special envoy , is to be one of the committee 's members .
on question time , tory education spokesman damian green described that move as like putting " dracula in charge of the blood transfusion service " .
in a newsnight interview this month mr blair said he was not familiar with the content of the magazines owned by mr desmond 's northern and shell company .
but if someone was fit to own one of britain 's biggest newspaper groups , there was no reason why labour should not take their money , he said .

derry city council is unveiling a new policy to raise awareness within its own staff and among other organisations .
londonderry had the highest number of incidents of domestic violence reported to the police last year .
chairperson of the council 's working party for the protection from domestic violence , councillor marie mcdaid , said it was a growing problem .
this issue has been ignored or swept under the carpet for years marie mcdaid councillor " we are the first employer in northern ireland to produce such a strategy , " she said .
" this issue has been ignored or swept under the carpet for years .
this document will be of considerable benefit to other employers and i would urge them follow our lead . "
issue guidelines the council began studying the issue several months ago and its policy statement was sent out to almost 380 organisations for consultation .
the councillor added : " the city council is one of the biggest employers locally and we wanted to raise awareness of this issue among staff , put in place arrangements to support staff who come forward as victims of domestic violence and issue guidelines to managers , as well as training on how to deal with the issue .
" last year , there were 1,336 domestic incidents reported in the foyle area and a substantial number of those involved violence .
there are even more cases going unreported because there are people out in the community living in fear marie mcdaid councillor " in the first three months of this year , just over 350 incidents have been reported and 151 of those involved violence .
violence against women accounted for 133 of those and the other 18 against men . "
she said the most harmful abuse was carried out by men against women , but abuse could also occur by women against men and within same sex relationships .
" there are even more cases going unreported because there are people out in the community living in fear , just simply afraid to come forward and tell their story to the appropriate agencies , " she said .
verbal abuse figures show four women died as a result of domestic violence last year .
two studies published earlier this year suggested nearly half of women have suffered domestic violence .
the studies , carried out in dublin and east london and published in the british medical journal , also indicated many doctors may be failing to identify domestic abuse victims .
both studies found about 40 % of women questioned had experienced physical or verbal abuse in a relationship .

the kidnappings are a blot on the country 's image abroad and increase the suffering of a population afflicted by 12 years of lawlessness .
since january gunmen have abducted a united nations employee who was released after a few days , a minister 's bodyguard who managed to escape , and the head of a military court .
in protest at the kidnapping of one of its somali employees , the un recently decided to suspend all operations in mogadishu , including a major polio vaccination campaign in one of the few countries where the disease is still a real menace .
' never pay ransom ' on 28 april , mohammed ali abukar , a un development programme co-ordinator and former lecturer in economics at mogadishu university , was on a bus going home from work when armed men stormed the vehicle and took him away in a van .
mogadishu police chief : no ransom negotiations the gunmen demanded a ransom of about $ 10,000 .
financial gain is the motive behind almost all cases of kidnapping .
" the un will never pay any ransom to release hostages , " says salah garad omar , the un 's head of security in mogadishu .
since mr abukar 's kidnapping , he has been going around all the somali capital 's fm radio stations trying to get this message across .
" if they continue paying a ransom , even half of the ransom , then it will be their kids ' turn to be abducted outside school .
that will hurt the poor people , " mr omar has said .
powerful tribe the kidnappers have been calling the un several times a day since the abduction .
it would become big business if we started paying .
it is better to kill the kidnappers , even the people who have been kidnapped , if we ca n't help it mogadishu police chief abdi hassan awale despite mr abukar 's poor health - high blood pressure and diarrhoea - the gunmen have refused him access to a doctor .
in mogadishu , people think they know who these men are .
people believe that the kidnappers belong to the same powerful clan as the city 's police chief and osman ali ato , one of the country 's main warlords .
they believe that these men have been involved in past kidnappings - that they have become specialists in the field .
negotiations clan elders are often called into action to try to get a hostage released .
the un has suspended polio vaccinations as mediators , they sometimes pay a quarter of the ransom , ironically to cover the kidnappers ' expenses - food and security - so all parties can end the kidnapping with some dignity .
kidnappings of aid officials or international workers attract a lot of publicity as high ransoms are demanded .
but in mogadishu , abduction can be a part of everyday disputes .
" you can be kidnapped because you have n't paid for your qat -lrb- a mild narcotic plant -rrb- , or the rent of your house , or your car , " explains the capital 's police chief , colonel abdi hassan awale .
" these are not the kidnappings that the international community hears about .
sometimes even a lady who owes $ 20 or $ 50 to another lady gets kidnapped . "
colonel awale accuses the un of being unwilling to share information to try and get mr abukar released .
he also claims that , in the past , the un has shot itself in the foot by hiring militiamen who then turned against it - instead of using the official police force .
private armies his 5,000 unpaid and poorly motivated men may not inspire much confidence among outsiders , and his hardline position against negotiations may also worry those who would seek his help .
" it would become big business if we started paying " , says colonel awale .
" it is better to kill the kidnappers , even the people who have been kidnapped , if we ca n't help it .
" although in the case of mr abukar the kidnappers are from my clan it does n't matter .
since they became kidnappers , they are my enemies , " colonel awale said .
the kidnapping business is very much alive .
foreigners visiting mogadishu have to organise a private armed escort which follows their every move from the minute they land at one of the airstrips around the capital .
visitors suffer from constant fear - anything can happen at any time .

most of the focus is on irish captain roy keane who was on a plane home on thursday after having a blazing row with the team 's manager .
the daily express bills it as one of the biggest world cup bust-ups of all .
' brooding loner ' the manchester united player finds himself in the psychiatrists ' chair , with some of fleet street 's top sports writers playing anthony clare .
the daily telegraph 's henry winter reckons the anger burning within him makes him the most phenomenally driven competitor in the history of the premiership , but it also destroys his ability to form friendships within football .
he is , says simon barnes in the times , the twin of john mcenroe , whose genius existed on the far edge of control .
over at the independent , james lawton says keane has always been a contradiction - a team man who was always the fierce , brooding loner .
national interest fintan o ' toole of the irish times , writing in the guardian , suggests that keane 's departure satisfies a duality in the irish national character .
the mourning is mixed with relief .
with him , there would always be some remote possibility of making a real impact on the world cup - with the risk of the bitter taste of disappointment when it all went wrong .
without him , there is no hope at all , and therefore nothing to be disappointed about when the lads fail heroically .
the daily mail turns its attention to the big news story of the day - france 's pledge to close the sangatte refugee camp .
the promise has only come , it reckons , because there is an election coming up there .
even so , it goes on , paris is still trying to blackmail britain into taking in hundreds of people from the centre .
you really have to admire the french for one thing , the paper says .

double-glazed in an editorial , it calls for more spending on the sciences , saying the best thing the government could do is to put more money into attracting inspirational teachers to reverse the decline in maths , physics and engineering .
