the german postal services giant says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers . german postal services and logistics giant deutsche post ag is continuing its rapid expansion in europe .
a spokeswoman confirmed wednesday that the company expects to be granted a license before the end of this month , allowing it to enter the letter-delivery market in britain .
" but we don ’ t have the license yet , " she cautioned .
a british license would take effect immediately .
it would initially allow deutsche post to make 40 million letter deliveries a year – around half the volume currently handled by britain ’ s state-owned royal mail service , recently renamed consignia .
people close to deutsche post in bonn said that the aim was to eventually obtain a full , long-term license for the british market .
the liberalization of britain ’ s letter-delivery market was originally scheduled for april this year but was postponed after cosignia warned it would go bankrupt if exposed to competition .
adhering to european union guidelines , the british government now plans to open up the market in three phases between 2003 and 2007 .
deutsche post currently operates on the british market via its 50 % subsidiary securicor omega express , whose license merely permits it to handle the internal mail of two major banks , royal bank of scotland and hsbc .
deutsche post declined to comment on possible plans to forge new partnerships or make acquisitions in britain .
it said it planned to mostly utilize consignia ’ s existing network .
chief executive klaus zumwinkel has repeatedly stated that expansion abroad was part of the deutsche post strategy to offset the effects of its shrinking monopoly at home .
as recently as the start of july he announced that his group planned to compete against market leader tnt post groep in the netherlands .
tnt also has its eye on the british market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com , 8.8.02 © economy .

the german postal services giant says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers . german postal services and logistics giant deutsche post ag is continuing its rapid expansion in europe .
a spokeswoman confirmed wednesday that the company expects to be granted a license before the end of this month , allowing it to enter the letter-delivery market in britain .
" but we don ’ t have the license yet , " she cautioned .
a british license would take effect immediately .
it would initially allow deutsche post to make 40 million letter deliveries a year – around half the volume currently handled by britain ’ s state-owned royal mail service , recently renamed consignia .
people close to deutsche post in bonn said that the aim was to eventually obtain a full , long-term license for the british market .
the liberalization of britain ’ s letter-delivery market was originally scheduled for april this year but was postponed after cosignia warned it would go bankrupt if exposed to competition .
adhering to european union guidelines , the british government now plans to open up the market in three phases between 2003 and 2007 .
deutsche post currently operates on the british market via its 50 % subsidiary securicor omega express , whose license merely permits it to handle the internal mail of two major banks , royal bank of scotland and hsbc .
deutsche post declined to comment on possible plans to forge new partnerships or make acquisitions in britain .
it said it planned to mostly utilize consignia ’ s existing network .
chief executive klaus zumwinkel has repeatedly stated that expansion abroad was part of the deutsche post strategy to offset the effects of its shrinking monopoly at home .
as recently as the start of july he announced that his group planned to compete against market leader tnt post groep in the netherlands .

the eu took a further step towards the ' fortress europe ' mentality when the association of german criminal investigators expressed its desire to introduce compulsory fingerprinting for all citizens in the country . in a radical move to step up security against threats of mass illegal immigration , the association of german criminal investigators -lrb- der bund deutscher kriminalbeamte -rrb- has announced plans to set up a central databank , which would document each inhabitant 's personal information by using their unique fingerprint as the identification device .
the proposals plot a course of thinking in line with the growing consensus across the european continent that strict control and monitoring of people will help to cope with the influx of illegal immigrants and the post-september 11th threat of infiltration by terrorist cells .
fingerprinting technology already in place the german criminal investigators believe that the technology to pursue the fingerprinting is already in place and that the process would be easy enough to implement across the country .
across europe steps to monitor the movement and numbers of citizens in the member states have already led to governments implementing control policies .

in their own effort to crack down on illegal immigration , spanish authorities plan to round up foreign-born street children and fingerprint them .
many of the children are smuggled into spain to beg .
the spanish government amended the foreigners law so that it can fingerprint the children , house them and identify them .

the prime minister , silvio berlusconi , fast-tracked a bill through parliament in may allowing all foreign residents and immigrants to be fingerprinted .
the policy does not stretch to foreign tourists on short visits to the country .
although berlusconi came up against heavy opposition to the bill , he vowed to unify his cabinet behind it and successfully sweep out those foreigners who are in the country illegally and deploy the navy against human traffickers if necessary .
" we do n't want europe to turn into a fortress , but we want to promote an integrated model that will guarantee the security of our citizens within our common space , " the italian interior minister , claudio scajola , told colleagues in the italian parliament at the time the bill was passed .

the german postal services giant says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers . german postal services and logistics giant deutsche post ag is continuing its rapid expansion in europe .
a spokeswoman confirmed wednesday that the company expects to be granted a license before the end of this month , allowing it to enter the letter-delivery market in britain .
" but we don ’ t have the license yet , " she cautioned .
a british license would take effect immediately .
it would initially allow deutsche post to make 40 million letter deliveries a year – around half the volume currently handled by britain ’ s state-owned royal mail service , recently renamed consignia .
people close to deutsche post in bonn said that the aim was to eventually obtain a full , long-term license for the british market .
the liberalization of britain ’ s letter-delivery market was originally scheduled for april this year but was postponed after cosignia warned it would go bankrupt if exposed to competition .
adhering to european union guidelines , the british government now plans to open up the market in three phases between 2003 and 2007 .
deutsche post currently operates on the british market via its 50 % subsidiary securicor omega express , whose license merely permits it to handle the internal mail of two major banks , royal bank of scotland and hsbc .
deutsche post declined to comment on possible plans to forge new partnerships or make acquisitions in britain .

the eu took a further step towards the ' fortress europe ' mentality when the association of german criminal investigators expressed its desire to introduce compulsory fingerprinting for all citizens in the country . in a radical move to step up security against threats of mass illegal immigration , the association of german criminal investigators -lrb- der bund deutscher kriminalbeamte -rrb- has announced plans to set up a central databank , which would document each inhabitant 's personal information by using their unique fingerprint as the identification device .
the proposals plot a course of thinking in line with the growing consensus across the european continent that strict control and monitoring of people will help to cope with the influx of illegal immigrants and the post-september 11th threat of infiltration by terrorist cells .
fingerprinting technology already in place the german criminal investigators believe that the technology to pursue the fingerprinting is already in place and that the process would be easy enough to implement across the country .
across europe steps to monitor the movement and numbers of citizens in the member states have already led to governments implementing control policies .
mariano rajoy , the spanish interior minister , told parliamentary colleagues in rome earlier this year that immigration was the " single most important phenomenon " europe would deal with in the coming years .
spanish law changed to allow printing of street children bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose maria aznar is almost convinced while chancellor schroeder remains tight lipped .
in their own effort to crack down on illegal immigration , spanish authorities plan to round up foreign-born street children and fingerprint them .
many of the children are smuggled into spain to beg .
the spanish government amended the foreigners law so that it can fingerprint the children , house them and identify them .
x-ray equipment will be used to determine the age of the children , because the spanish government believes some young adults pretend to be teenagers to avoid deportation .
under spanish law , children may not be deported .
italy leads with monitoring of foreigners and immigrants italy too has successfully pushed through a contentious crackdown on immigrants through its parliament despite splits in the government and protests from civil rights groups .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio shows his support for compulsory fingerprinting .
the prime minister , silvio berlusconi , fast-tracked a bill through parliament in may allowing all foreign residents and immigrants to be fingerprinted .
the policy does not stretch to foreign tourists on short visits to the country .
although berlusconi came up against heavy opposition to the bill , he vowed to unify his cabinet behind it and successfully sweep out those foreigners who are in the country illegally and deploy the navy against human traffickers if necessary .
" we do n't want europe to turn into a fortress , but we want to promote an integrated model that will guarantee the security of our citizens within our common space , " the italian interior minister , claudio scajola , told colleagues in the italian parliament at the time the bill was passed .
italy has also put forward a feasibility study for an eu border guard , which the european commission wants in place by 2007 .
it includes ideas for common legislation , shared information and a mobile police rapid reaction unit .
south american practices to sweep eu member states ?
if widespread fingerprinting for citizens is adopted across europe , it will become a continent similar to south america where inhabitants in chile , colombia , ecuador , argentina and brazil carry personal identification containing prints .
even nationals living in other countries have to provide fingerprints for their home country passports .

the proposals plot a course of thinking in line with the growing consensus across the european continent that strict control and monitoring of people will help to cope with the influx of illegal immigrants and the post-september 11th threat of infiltration by terrorist cells .
fingerprinting technology already in place the german criminal investigators believe that the technology to pursue the fingerprinting is already in place and that the process would be easy enough to implement across the country .

the german postal services giant says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers . german postal services and logistics giant deutsche post ag is continuing its rapid expansion in europe .
a spokeswoman confirmed wednesday that the company expects to be granted a license before the end of this month , allowing it to enter the letter-delivery market in britain .
" but we don ’ t have the license yet , " she cautioned .
a british license would take effect immediately .
it would initially allow deutsche post to make 40 million letter deliveries a year – around half the volume currently handled by britain ’ s state-owned royal mail service , recently renamed consignia .
people close to deutsche post in bonn said that the aim was to eventually obtain a full , long-term license for the british market .
the liberalization of britain ’ s letter-delivery market was originally scheduled for april this year but was postponed after cosignia warned it would go bankrupt if exposed to competition .
adhering to european union guidelines , the british government now plans to open up the market in three phases between 2003 and 2007 .
deutsche post currently operates on the british market via its 50 % subsidiary securicor omega express , whose license merely permits it to handle the internal mail of two major banks , royal bank of scotland and hsbc .
deutsche post declined to comment on possible plans to forge new partnerships or make acquisitions in britain .
it said it planned to mostly utilize consignia ’ s existing network .
chief executive klaus zumwinkel has repeatedly stated that expansion abroad was part of the deutsche post strategy to offset the effects of its shrinking monopoly at home .

the german postal services giant says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers . german postal services and logistics giant deutsche post ag is continuing its rapid expansion in europe .
a spokeswoman confirmed wednesday that the company expects to be granted a license before the end of this month , allowing it to enter the letter-delivery market in britain .
" but we don ’ t have the license yet , " she cautioned .
a british license would take effect immediately .
it would initially allow deutsche post to make 40 million letter deliveries a year – around half the volume currently handled by britain ’ s state-owned royal mail service , recently renamed consignia .
people close to deutsche post in bonn said that the aim was to eventually obtain a full , long-term license for the british market .
the liberalization of britain ’ s letter-delivery market was originally scheduled for april this year but was postponed after cosignia warned it would go bankrupt if exposed to competition .
adhering to european union guidelines , the british government now plans to open up the market in three phases between 2003 and 2007 .
deutsche post currently operates on the british market via its 50 % subsidiary securicor omega express , whose license merely permits it to handle the internal mail of two major banks , royal bank of scotland and hsbc .
deutsche post declined to comment on possible plans to forge new partnerships or make acquisitions in britain .
it said it planned to mostly utilize consignia ’ s existing network .
chief executive klaus zumwinkel has repeatedly stated that expansion abroad was part of the deutsche post strategy to offset the effects of its shrinking monopoly at home .
as recently as the start of july he announced that his group planned to compete against market leader tnt post groep in the netherlands .
tnt also has its eye on the british market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com , 8.8.02 © economy .

the eu took a further step towards the ' fortress europe ' mentality when the association of german criminal investigators expressed its desire to introduce compulsory fingerprinting for all citizens in the country . in a radical move to step up security against threats of mass illegal immigration , the association of german criminal investigators -lrb- der bund deutscher kriminalbeamte -rrb- has announced plans to set up a central databank , which would document each inhabitant 's personal information by using their unique fingerprint as the identification device .
the proposals plot a course of thinking in line with the growing consensus across the european continent that strict control and monitoring of people will help to cope with the influx of illegal immigrants and the post-september 11th threat of infiltration by terrorist cells .
fingerprinting technology already in place the german criminal investigators believe that the technology to pursue the fingerprinting is already in place and that the process would be easy enough to implement across the country .
across europe steps to monitor the movement and numbers of citizens in the member states have already led to governments implementing control policies .

the policy does not stretch to foreign tourists on short visits to the country .
although berlusconi came up against heavy opposition to the bill , he vowed to unify his cabinet behind it and successfully sweep out those foreigners who are in the country illegally and deploy the navy against human traffickers if necessary .
" we do n't want europe to turn into a fortress , but we want to promote an integrated model that will guarantee the security of our citizens within our common space , " the italian interior minister , claudio scajola , told colleagues in the italian parliament at the time the bill was passed .

the german postal services giant says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers . german postal services and logistics giant deutsche post ag is continuing its rapid expansion in europe .
a spokeswoman confirmed wednesday that the company expects to be granted a license before the end of this month , allowing it to enter the letter-delivery market in britain .
" but we don ’ t have the license yet , " she cautioned .
a british license would take effect immediately .
it would initially allow deutsche post to make 40 million letter deliveries a year – around half the volume currently handled by britain ’ s state-owned royal mail service , recently renamed consignia .
people close to deutsche post in bonn said that the aim was to eventually obtain a full , long-term license for the british market .
the liberalization of britain ’ s letter-delivery market was originally scheduled for april this year but was postponed after cosignia warned it would go bankrupt if exposed to competition .
adhering to european union guidelines , the british government now plans to open up the market in three phases between 2003 and 2007 .
deutsche post currently operates on the british market via its 50 % subsidiary securicor omega express , whose license merely permits it to handle the internal mail of two major banks , royal bank of scotland and hsbc .
deutsche post declined to comment on possible plans to forge new partnerships or make acquisitions in britain .
it said it planned to mostly utilize consignia ’ s existing network .
chief executive klaus zumwinkel has repeatedly stated that expansion abroad was part of the deutsche post strategy to offset the effects of its shrinking monopoly at home .
as recently as the start of july he announced that his group planned to compete against market leader tnt post groep in the netherlands .
tnt also has its eye on the british market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com , 8.8.02 © economy .

the german postal services giant says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers . german postal services and logistics giant deutsche post ag is continuing its rapid expansion in europe .
a spokeswoman confirmed wednesday that the company expects to be granted a license before the end of this month , allowing it to enter the letter-delivery market in britain .
" but we don ’ t have the license yet , " she cautioned .
a british license would take effect immediately .
it would initially allow deutsche post to make 40 million letter deliveries a year – around half the volume currently handled by britain ’ s state-owned royal mail service , recently renamed consignia .
people close to deutsche post in bonn said that the aim was to eventually obtain a full , long-term license for the british market .
the liberalization of britain ’ s letter-delivery market was originally scheduled for april this year but was postponed after cosignia warned it would go bankrupt if exposed to competition .
adhering to european union guidelines , the british government now plans to open up the market in three phases between 2003 and 2007 .
deutsche post currently operates on the british market via its 50 % subsidiary securicor omega express , whose license merely permits it to handle the internal mail of two major banks , royal bank of scotland and hsbc .

the eu took a further step towards the ' fortress europe ' mentality when the association of german criminal investigators expressed its desire to introduce compulsory fingerprinting for all citizens in the country . in a radical move to step up security against threats of mass illegal immigration , the association of german criminal investigators -lrb- der bund deutscher kriminalbeamte -rrb- has announced plans to set up a central databank , which would document each inhabitant 's personal information by using their unique fingerprint as the identification device .
the proposals plot a course of thinking in line with the growing consensus across the european continent that strict control and monitoring of people will help to cope with the influx of illegal immigrants and the post-september 11th threat of infiltration by terrorist cells .
fingerprinting technology already in place the german criminal investigators believe that the technology to pursue the fingerprinting is already in place and that the process would be easy enough to implement across the country .
across europe steps to monitor the movement and numbers of citizens in the member states have already led to governments implementing control policies .
mariano rajoy , the spanish interior minister , told parliamentary colleagues in rome earlier this year that immigration was the " single most important phenomenon " europe would deal with in the coming years .
spanish law changed to allow printing of street children bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish prime minister jose maria aznar is almost convinced while chancellor schroeder remains tight lipped .
in their own effort to crack down on illegal immigration , spanish authorities plan to round up foreign-born street children and fingerprint them .
many of the children are smuggled into spain to beg .
the spanish government amended the foreigners law so that it can fingerprint the children , house them and identify them .
x-ray equipment will be used to determine the age of the children , because the spanish government believes some young adults pretend to be teenagers to avoid deportation .
under spanish law , children may not be deported .
italy leads with monitoring of foreigners and immigrants italy too has successfully pushed through a contentious crackdown on immigrants through its parliament despite splits in the government and protests from civil rights groups .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio shows his support for compulsory fingerprinting .
the prime minister , silvio berlusconi , fast-tracked a bill through parliament in may allowing all foreign residents and immigrants to be fingerprinted .
the policy does not stretch to foreign tourists on short visits to the country .
although berlusconi came up against heavy opposition to the bill , he vowed to unify his cabinet behind it and successfully sweep out those foreigners who are in the country illegally and deploy the navy against human traffickers if necessary .
" we do n't want europe to turn into a fortress , but we want to promote an integrated model that will guarantee the security of our citizens within our common space , " the italian interior minister , claudio scajola , told colleagues in the italian parliament at the time the bill was passed .
italy has also put forward a feasibility study for an eu border guard , which the european commission wants in place by 2007 .
it includes ideas for common legislation , shared information and a mobile police rapid reaction unit .
south american practices to sweep eu member states ?
if widespread fingerprinting for citizens is adopted across europe , it will become a continent similar to south america where inhabitants in chile , colombia , ecuador , argentina and brazil carry personal identification containing prints .

the german postal services giant says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers . german postal services and logistics giant deutsche post ag is continuing its rapid expansion in europe .
a spokeswoman confirmed wednesday that the company expects to be granted a license before the end of this month , allowing it to enter the letter-delivery market in britain .
" but we don ’ t have the license yet , " she cautioned .
a british license would take effect immediately .
it would initially allow deutsche post to make 40 million letter deliveries a year – around half the volume currently handled by britain ’ s state-owned royal mail service , recently renamed consignia .
people close to deutsche post in bonn said that the aim was to eventually obtain a full , long-term license for the british market .
the liberalization of britain ’ s letter-delivery market was originally scheduled for april this year but was postponed after cosignia warned it would go bankrupt if exposed to competition .
adhering to european union guidelines , the british government now plans to open up the market in three phases between 2003 and 2007 .
deutsche post currently operates on the british market via its 50 % subsidiary securicor omega express , whose license merely permits it to handle the internal mail of two major banks , royal bank of scotland and hsbc .
deutsche post declined to comment on possible plans to forge new partnerships or make acquisitions in britain .
it said it planned to mostly utilize consignia ’ s existing network .
chief executive klaus zumwinkel has repeatedly stated that expansion abroad was part of the deutsche post strategy to offset the effects of its shrinking monopoly at home .
as recently as the start of july he announced that his group planned to compete against market leader tnt post groep in the netherlands .

the german postal services giant says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers . german postal services and logistics giant deutsche post ag is continuing its rapid expansion in europe .
a spokeswoman confirmed wednesday that the company expects to be granted a license before the end of this month , allowing it to enter the letter-delivery market in britain .
" but we don ’ t have the license yet , " she cautioned .
a british license would take effect immediately .
it would initially allow deutsche post to make 40 million letter deliveries a year – around half the volume currently handled by britain ’ s state-owned royal mail service , recently renamed consignia .
people close to deutsche post in bonn said that the aim was to eventually obtain a full , long-term license for the british market .
the liberalization of britain ’ s letter-delivery market was originally scheduled for april this year but was postponed after cosignia warned it would go bankrupt if exposed to competition .
adhering to european union guidelines , the british government now plans to open up the market in three phases between 2003 and 2007 .
deutsche post currently operates on the british market via its 50 % subsidiary securicor omega express , whose license merely permits it to handle the internal mail of two major banks , royal bank of scotland and hsbc .
deutsche post declined to comment on possible plans to forge new partnerships or make acquisitions in britain .
it said it planned to mostly utilize consignia ’ s existing network .
chief executive klaus zumwinkel has repeatedly stated that expansion abroad was part of the deutsche post strategy to offset the effects of its shrinking monopoly at home .
as recently as the start of july he announced that his group planned to compete against market leader tnt post groep in the netherlands .

the german postal services giant says it expects to receive a preliminary license for great britain that will allow it to deliver up to 40 million letters a year , half the number that britain ’ s ex-monopolist delivers . german postal services and logistics giant deutsche post ag is continuing its rapid expansion in europe .
a spokeswoman confirmed wednesday that the company expects to be granted a license before the end of this month , allowing it to enter the letter-delivery market in britain .
" but we don ’ t have the license yet , " she cautioned .
a british license would take effect immediately .
it would initially allow deutsche post to make 40 million letter deliveries a year – around half the volume currently handled by britain ’ s state-owned royal mail service , recently renamed consignia .
people close to deutsche post in bonn said that the aim was to eventually obtain a full , long-term license for the british market .
the liberalization of britain ’ s letter-delivery market was originally scheduled for april this year but was postponed after cosignia warned it would go bankrupt if exposed to competition .
adhering to european union guidelines , the british government now plans to open up the market in three phases between 2003 and 2007 .
deutsche post currently operates on the british market via its 50 % subsidiary securicor omega express , whose license merely permits it to handle the internal mail of two major banks , royal bank of scotland and hsbc .
deutsche post declined to comment on possible plans to forge new partnerships or make acquisitions in britain .
it said it planned to mostly utilize consignia ’ s existing network .
chief executive klaus zumwinkel has repeatedly stated that expansion abroad was part of the deutsche post strategy to offset the effects of its shrinking monopoly at home .

max foster reports on a new cause of airport delays holiday-makers are facing extra delays at britain 's major airports , because they 're persistently ignoring new security rules .
in the wake of last year 's september 11 attacks , airlines are stricly enforcing rules banning all sharp objects , even nail-scissors , from hand-luggage. click here for a list of banned objects breakfast has learned that 15,000 banned items are being confiscated every day from passengers , at heathrow , stansted at gatwick airports .
our reporter max foster spent an afternoon in gatwick airport , to get an idea of the scale of the problem : early afternoon , and queues into the hand luggage security check area were stretching right back into the main terminal building .
this is usually one of the quietest times of day .
the whole system has slowed down because passengers are still carrying sharp objects in their handluggage , despite a ban imposed after september 11th .
2,000 pairs of scissors are confiscated each day passengers are warned at check-in to put the objects in the luggage which goes inthe aircraft hold .
posters repeat the message around the terminal .
but nail scissors , kitchen knives , pen knives , hyperdermic needles , cork screws , sharp belt buckles and handcuffs are still being carried through .
each time one is detected , the passenger is taken to one side to have their bags searched .
one in seventeen passengers has a potentially dangerous object confiscated .
" it 's a nightmare " , says terminal security manager , keith booker .
" we 've had forty thousand passengers each day this last weekend .
" if you stop one in seventeen of those , it takes a few minutes to actually go through the process , taking things out of peoples ' bags , doing the paperwork if necessary .
it all takes time so it does slow things down . "
many passengers claimed to know the rules , but had somehow ignored them .
research carried out by the british airports authority showed that 81 % claim to know the new hand luggage security restrictions .
one passenger caught with nail scissors told breakfast : " yes i probably was aware but i had forgotten actually .
i did n't remember seeing any signs . "
another who had a pen-knife said : " there are plenty of signs and i was asked on check-in but i take that knife wherever i go and i must admit i thought it was in my suitcase as opposed to my handluggage " .
in the middle of the holiday season , the risk of queues developing at both check-in and security is at its highest .
hundreds of extra security staff have been taken on by the main airport operator , baa .
but some frustrated passengers are taking their anger out on guards .
there 's been a surge in verbal and physical abuse .
a security officer told breakfast that people often get angry when their personal items are confiscated .
a female security official has been punched in the face .
when a woman had her set of nail scissors taken away which she claimed were a family heirloom , her daughter , who said she was a barrister , threatened legal action .
another woman complained that she had n't been able to cut her toenails for a fornight on holiday because her clippers where confiscated .
breakfast this morning reported live from gatwick airport .
gatwick 's managing director roger cato told us : cato : we do n't want to fine passengers " a lot of things in life are n't certain but one thing is .
by the end of today , we shall be the proud owners of another 2,000 pairs of nail scissors .
" we are trying to get the message across with posters and floorwalkers - but we do n't want to fine passengers , that would n't be good customer care . " click here to watch roger cato 's interview in full banned from hand lugage : scissors , tweezers , knives , razor blades , toy or replica guns , catapults , household cutlery , tools , hypodermic needles -lrb- unless needed for medical reasons -rrb- , knitting needles , darts , sports bats , billiard , snooker or pool cues and other sharp objects. click here to read some of your comments on airport security click here for the latest advice from gatwick airport home when we are on air recent forums programme archive studio tour today 's information meet the team presenters reporters your say contact us your comments internet links : gatwick 's security advice the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites e-mail this story to a friend links to more breakfast stories in this section running the red soak the rich metrosexual man casualty 's big day rail passengers face above inflation rise the truth about nanotechnology hoover street revival hitchcock blonde when violence begins at home more children suffering from eating disorders calling time on licensing laws the lessons of the trupti patel case open all hours ^ ^ back to top news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes - to bbc sport > > -pipe- to bbc weather > > -pipe- to bbc world service > > - © mmiii -pipe- news sources -pipe- privacy

but that 's exactly what 's expected from a new prototype designed specifically with the elderly and disabled in mind .
sue nelson reports live from a london basement a british company is developing a robotic arm , which fully mimics a human hand .
within a year , it 's hoping to train it to fetch a drink .
our science correspondent sue nelson , went to meet the robot 's inventor in a north london basement to find out more. click here to watch sue nelson 's live report in full richard greenhill told breakfast that the arm has been in development since 1982 .
that 's when he began work on an " air muscle " which mimics the activity of 40 muscles in the arm and hand .
the aim is to create a machine which can fetch a glass of water for an elderly person in the middle of the night .
that means the robot must be mobile and capable of navigating around a house , as well as able to pick up a fragile object like a glass .
the shadow robot company has been given a grant of £ 75,000 to help develop idea the national endowment for science , technology and the arts -lrb- nesta -rrb- .

the outbreak was detected last week all of those stricken by the bug have been in contact with the rothiemurchus caravan park at coylumbridge , near aviemore .
householders and businesses in the area have been advised to use boiled or bottled water .
tests carried out last week confirmed the presence of the e. coli o157 bacterium in the water supply to the camp .
it is believed that the flash flooding that swept much of the country in the past three weeks may have washed manure or other substances into what would normally have been a safe system .
more than 40 houses in the area use the same private water supply .
health officials have advised anyone who has been in contact with the water supply in the second half of july , or who is experiencing diarrhoea or vomiting , to contact their gp for advice .
the outbreak was first detected on 1 august .

the equal opportunities commission report said there was a pay gap between average male and female graduate salaries across all occupations .
it was widest in law , mathematics and computing and at its narrowest in education .
teaching application figures are on the rise the effect is more pronounced in the private sector than the public sector .
according to the report , women graduates earn less than men , even when they have studied the same subjects , with the same class of degree and enter the same industry .
the equal opportunities commission said employers must show that they took equal pay seriously if they wanted to recruit the best .
the national union of students said it was " vitally important " that graduates were aware of the pay gap when looking for work .
it said they should ask prospective employers about their equal pay policies .
training institutions meanwhile , there has been a massive increase in teaching training applications from graduates north of the border .
the 133 % rise reported by the graduate teacher training registry was attributed to factors such as the introduction of a 35-hour week for teachers in scotland .
however , the organisation acknowledged that it had expected to see an increase because more training institutions had joined its system .
it said the number of applications had risen from 1,763 in 2001 to 4,115 this year .
across the uk as a whole there was an 18 % increase in applications .

the condition has become associated with air travel , where passengers tend to sit immobile for long periods of time .
but the foundation says the phenomenon could affect anyone seated in the confined space for long periods , including the car .
people making long journeys by car this summer might be wise to take some sensible , precautionary measures edmund king , rac a french cardiologist has published a report saying any journey of more than four hours carried a risk of pulmonary embolism or blood clots - irrespective of the means of transport .
the report found 70 % of travellers at risk of dvt , and who had made recent journeys , had actually travelled by car - a much higher proportion than those who had used a train or plane .
rac foundation executive director edmund king said : " it is , as yet , uncertain whether dvt poses a threat to everyone travelling or immobile for more than four hours or whether travelling for long period can trigger dvt in those who are medically or genetically predisposed to blood clots .
take exercise " in either case , however , people making long journeys by car this summer might be wise to take some sensible , precautionary measures , such as taking breaks and drinking plenty of water .
" these are also actions which can help drivers to avoid fatigue .
quite often it -lrb- dvt -rrb- will develop a while after the journey edmund king , rac " for anyone in the ' at risk ' category , it is even more important to heed this advice . "
mr king suggested drivers take a break " at least " every two hours to walk around , to drink water and to rotate their feet .
" quite often it -lrb- dvt -rrb- will develop a while after the journey , " he said .
a consultant at addenbrooke 's hospital in cambridge has also recently cited the case of a six-foot student who developed dvt after travelling between leicester and aberdeen in a friend 's mini .
dr marcus flather , a consultant cardiologist at the royal brompton hospital , west london , said : " one or two cases do not make an epidemic .
" but having said that there are so many people driving , and they are probably driving longer distances , that i think we do need to take it seriously . "
dvt refers to the formation of a blood clot within a deep vein , usually in the thigh or calf .
the blood clot can either partially or completely block the flow of blood in the vein .
it is a significant problem following surgery .
life-threatening the most common serious complication of dvt is a pulmonary embolism , where a blood clot breaks free from a vein wall , travels to the lung and blocks an artery .
a pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening and needs immediate medical attention dvt is more common in the elderly , the very overweight and people with heart disease .
however , healthy young people can develop it as well . watch / listen on this story dr marcus flather , consultant cardiologist " aspirin will reduce the risk of dvt " see also : 28 jul 02 -pipe- health short-sighted drivers targeted 04 jan 02 -pipe- health back seat menace to drivers 30 oct 01 -pipe- health driving increases back pain risk 27 jul 02 -pipe- health ' i lost my leg to dvt ' 11 jun 02 -pipe- health dvt campaigners lobby euro mps internet links : rac deep vein thrombosis the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top health stories now : heart risk link to big families back pain drug ' may aid diabetics ' congo ebola outbreak confirmed vegetables ward off alzheimer 's polio campaign launched in iraq gene defect explains high blood pressure botox ' may cause new wrinkles ' alien ' abductees ' show real symptoms links to more health stories are at the foot of the page .

the snowdonia hawkweed has been described as the welsh dodo because botanists thought it had become extinct from the slopes of the country 's highest peak .
this is as exciting as finding a new tree in the tropics professor charles stirton it was thought to have fallen victim to the thousands of sheep , which are left to roam high in the area 's hills .
but the foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001 appears to have given it a chance for a new lease of life and botanists at the national botanic garden of wales are determined to help it flourish .
they have taken delivery of a specimen which was seen on a nature reserve where sheep are now no longer allowed to graze .
it may be the only spot in the world where the flower grows as it struggles with the pressures facing all wild flowers : the erosion of habitat through over-grazing , deforestation , over-collection and climate change .
professor stirton : excited at discovery at the carmarthenshire-based botanic garden , seeds from the plant are to be collected and grown at the site 's glasshouses so that some day it can be re-introduced to the wild in greater numbers .
professor charles stirton , director of the gardens , said : " we often hear of extinctions in the tropical rainforest and other parts of the world but we have a very unique flora in this part .
" we do n't have a vast number of species , but many of what we do have are restricted to mountain tops and are very , very rare .
" this is as exciting as finding a new tree in the tropics .
" it is quite interesting that the recent discovery has come a year after we 've had foot-and-mouth and there has been reduced grazing .
so there is a correlation . "
hawkweed seeds are to be propagated this break for the snowdonia hawkweed has come as wales 's flora faces what could be its greatest challenge in centuries .
in march , this year the woodland trust claimed that global warming could pose a serious threat to wales 's woodland .
it said research suggested that the welsh oak could disappear together , along with bluebells and other woodland plants and animals . watch / listen on this story bbc wales ' tim jones " the re-discovery of the snowdonia hawkweed has caused a stir in some circles " see also : 21 mar 01 -pipe- wales welsh woodlands face climate threat 16 aug 01 -pipe- wales ' bloom raiders ' warned on theft 16 jul 02 -pipe- wales lifeline for botanic garden 14 nov 01 -pipe- science / nature wildlife will wander in warmer world 24 may 00 -pipe- wales wales 's green ' jewel in the hills ' 18 jun 00 -pipe- science / nature uk woods ' survival ' at risk ' 18 feb 00 -pipe- wales dramatic climate changes predicted internet links : national botanic garden of wales national assembly for wales woodland trust , ancient woodland campaign the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : boyfriend sought in murder inquiry girl will wait for jailed ' rapist ' lover cash boost for brecon jazz hello !

shoppers in australia , new zealand , taiwan and particularly hong kong are becoming markedly more gloomy about their prospects , market research firm acnielsen said .
the firm said 99 % of the 8,000 people in 13 asian countries it interviewed said they felt in the grip of a global recession , up from 85 % in its last survey six months ago .
" it looks like we may have to wait another 12 to 18 months before the region 's consumers open their wallets again , " said frank martell , president , acnielsen asia pacific .
one third of those polled said the general worsening of the economy was their biggest fear , while 27 % - and as many as 39 % of the hong kong sample - put job security at the top of the list .
mixed messages the picture was by no means dismal across the board .
in mainland china , south korea and singapore - the states with the best recent economic performance - consumers were more optimistic than they were in december 2001 .
but , in general , sentiment was worsening , acnielsen said .
only 14 % of the sample said they thought recovery will come before the end of the year , while one quarter said it would take until at least 2004 for things pick up .
" prolonged deflation and a depressed property sector added to rising unemployment and volatile equity markets have taken a real toll on consumer confidence , " mr martell said .
" people do not yet see much light on the horizon . "
major purchases such as cars , investments and property are being put on hold till circumstances improve , he said .
going down under one key change , acnielsen said , is that australasia 's weak currencies , and strong export performance , were no longer shielding it from the global slowdown .
" previously , australasia had been largely insulated from the recession , due mainly to the wealth effect of the property boom in those countries , " thursday 's report said .
" what we are now seeing is raising concerns in australia and new zealand as to whether the local economies can remain buoyant in the face of a sustained downturn in the us . "

american officials have made clear that no decision had yet been taken on military action .
on wednesday iraqi foreign minister naji sabri said his country would not give in to pressure from the united states and britain over arms inspections .
speaking in an interview with the bbc in baghdad , mr sabri reiterated that iraq would only readmit united nations arms inspectors if the economic sanctions against baghdad were also lifted .
' diktats ' he also warned that iraq would defend itself if attacked , and ridiculed us and british claims that the country was developing weapons of mass destruction or threatening its neighbours .
sabri : " iraq will defend itself " " where is this threat ?
this is nonsense , " mr sabri said .

un arms inspectors , imposed on iraq after the gulf war , pulled out before a us-led air strike in 1998 .
they were not allowed back in .
us president george w bush has repeatedly said he is committed to a " regime change " in iraq , but on wednesday he promised to consult widely before action was taken .

such a venue can be found in a damp , deserted bank vault under george iv bridge in central edinburgh .
for 11 months of the year , it serves as extra storage space for the central library 's book collection .
but for the last three years , the books have had to find a new home every august .
during the festival period , the former bank vault and sometime book stack transforms itself into an eccentric maze of underground stages and bars as part of the edinburgh fringe .
for a few days before the festival opens , the venue , known as the underbelly , becomes a building site as legions of technicians and venue staff paint walls , erect bars and fireproof backdrops .
" yesterday they had to mask off all the beer taps while they built the bar , " said jack shute , a stage manager for one of the companies performing at the venue .
even the wcs were erected at the last minute .
" this morning , there was just a row of toilets along the wall with two guys frantically building cubicles around them , " mr shute added .
bus tops ever since eight theatre groups gatecrashed the first edinburgh international festival in 1947 , setting themselves up " on the fringes " enterprising fringe performers have turned venue-hunting into a fine art .
following several years of neglect , the underbelly fell into the hands of ed bartlam , an edinburgh university student who was looking for a place to stage five plays .
mr bartlam 's company performed at the venue for the first time in 2000 , before taking over the space in 2001 and inviting other performers in .
they are continuing a tradition that has seen the mounting of performances on top of double-decker buses , in church-halls and on park benches .
this year 's fringe is no exception to the rule that , " if it can take your weight , you can perform on it " .
in 2002 , there are more than 160 venues , including five hotels , three big tops , a bank , a deli and a shopping centre .
lift festival-goers can catch a show on the plane to edinburgh , with easyjet presenting live in-flight entertainment .
once in the city , they can experience this year 's smallest venue - a production in a custom-built elevator .
venue management has developed into a delicate science over the years .
this year , for the first time , the fringe , in conjunction with scottish enterprise edinburgh and lothian , is running a training programme for venue managers .
" companies come and go , but venue managers are a constant , " said paul gudgin , director of the fringe .
" we 're trying to fast-track the development of venue staff . "
similarly , individual venues are acquiring an acute business sense .
this year , for the first time , small to medium venues the underbelly and aurora nova won sponsorship .
and while most venues offer a box-office split to incoming companies with , typically , 60 % of receipts going to the company and the remainder to the venue , aurora nova does things differently .
sixty per cent of its box office takings are split equally between all the companies performing there and the management , while 40 % goes to the individual companies .
alice hartmann , media relations representative for the venue said the system provides " flexibility " for poorer companies .
" last year all the companies covered their costs ; this year they might take some pocket money away with them . "
offence the relationship between companies and their venues is usually good but sometimes things do not run smoothly .
for scott pardue , finding a home for his play , hookin ' for jesus , proved difficult .
having lost their original venue , the production aimed to open at st john 's hall , part of a church .
mr pardue was worried that the company would forfeit their space if the church took offence at the play 's apparently x-rated content .
previously , an edinburgh landlady decided she would not house the company after reading a press release for the show .
the church asked to see the script and mr pardue spent anxious days waiting to hear back .
" we can only guess as to the reason why they requested the script , but we feel confident that they will not turn us out , " he said 10 days before kick-off .
luckily for him , hookin ' for jesus opened at the hall as planned .

previously , an edinburgh landlady decided she would not house the company after reading a press release for the show .
the church asked to see the script and mr pardue spent anxious days waiting to hear back .
" we can only guess as to the reason why they requested the script , but we feel confident that they will not turn us out , " he said 10 days before kick-off .
luckily for him , hookin ' for jesus opened at the hall as planned .

the industrial action is likely to affect the library 's document supply centre at boston spa in yorkshire .
members of the public and commercial services union -lrb- pcs -rrb- took similar action in pursuit of a pay claim on 29 july but the impact was said to be minimal .
" we will strive to make sure this is the case again , " said ian henderson , head of document supply at boston spa .
" we apologise to users of the library 's services for any disruption that may occur during the strikes . "
pcs members accepted a pay rise of 3.6 % in august 2001 on the basis that a further increase in salary would follow .
however , the union claims the current offer of 0.4 % - giving an overall pay increase of 4 % - is unacceptable to its members .
the last strike closed library reading rooms officials at the library said they regretted the industrial action and added there were no more funds to pay workers any more than the average 4 % pay rise .
two other unions who represent staff at the library had accepted this pay offer , they added .
the library 's lowest paid workers earn as little as £ 12,000 , but bosses have insisted that the 4 % rise is just the average across the staff , and those on lower incomes will receive a higher , 5.6 % pay rise .
the last strike forced the closure of reading rooms in the st pancras building in central london , but the library remained open .
the newspaper library at colindate in north london was also open , and the document supply service at boston spa was unaffected .

by jorn madslien bbc news online business reporter as part of a weekly series on women in business , bbc news online examines controversial plans to increase the number of women on norwegian company boards .
norway 's corporate elite is up in arms over plans to force the appointment of more women to companies ' boards of directors .
laila daavoey : women have rights a proposal to compel both state owned and listed private companies to appoint women to at least 40 % of boardroom places could become law by 2005 .
the move should help companies utilise women 's competence and , as such , should boost their profits , the country 's children and family affairs minister laila daavoey told bbc news online .
but , given that the ultimate result would be to unseat many of norway 's leading directors , the proposal has been widely received as a head-on attack on the country 's business establishment .
the confederation of norwegian business and industry , nho , sees the proposal as an onslaught on the basic principle for shareholder democracy - namely that the owners of a company should be free to elect its board .
true reflection ms daavoey is not deterred by such opposition , insisting that the current 7.3 % female representation on companies ' boards is far too low .
kirsti kierulf : men do n't see the women " we need greater diversity on the boards , " she said , insisting that unless quotas are introduced it would take several decades before women would be properly represented .
the proposed law would come into effect in three years unless norwegian companies have already appointed women to 40 % of their boards ' seats .
" women should have the right to participate in this part of business too , " said ms daavoey .
she wants to unseat the " core " of men who have for years been " unwilling " to give up their positions of power .
" many of them are lawyers or economists " whose somewhat blinkered views often fail to " reflect the diversity of society at large " , ms daavoey insisted .
" given that the companies themselves do n't see that it would be better to have more women on their boards , we will have to help them a bit , " ms daavoey said .
hege sjo : trust market forces kirsti kierulf , director of the womens university , agreed .
" there are a lot of beautiful , well educated and experienced women who are more than capable and more than willing to take that responsibility , " ms kierulf said .
" the community and the boards and the voting committees to the boards do not see them because men are not used to see women in that perspective . "
detrimental to women the world of business is not convinced .
the oslo stock exchange , which would be left with the burden of making sure companies obey a new law , has rallied against the proposal .
anita krohn thrane : tokenism not the answer " in principle , the exchange is opposed to any rules which hinder the efficient workings of the market , " market director hege sjo , a prominent business woman in her own right , said .
" our view is that if investors want a greater proportion of women , then it will happen by itself . "
" gender quotas are the wrong tools , " added nho legal director ingebjoerg harto .
" they result in women not being appreciated for their skills . "
already there the voices of the business establishment have gained support from young , high-flying females who have already climbed to great heights without receiving a leg-up from the state .
my personal -lsb- opinion -rsb- is that if you can find a board of directors which also has a good balance between men and women , that adds to the quality of the board olav fjell , statoil " it 's the government 's role to put it on the agenda , especially in companies where the state has ownership , " 30-year-old anita krohn thrane , director of global strategy at the risk management firm det norske veritas ' software arm , said .
" but imposing a new law ?
i would not be comfortable if i knew that i was quoted into a boardroom just because i was a woman .
" there 's a generation gap in norway .
in my generation we hardly ever talk about gender issues , " ms thrane said , describing the debate as " narrow " and insisting that issues such as age and background should also be taken into account .
already happening but while the opposition to the government 's move is highly vocal , it is far from universal , ms daavoey said .
" many companies in norway believe this is exciting and are working actively with this , " she said .
" many agree that this is the right way to go . "
among the corporate giants taking a lead is statoil , the oil giant floated on the stock market last summer .
last month , statoil appointed three women to its board - though one of them has since stepped down for personal reasons and is due to be replaced .
chief executive olav fjell insisted that the women were not appointed merely due to their gender .
" from the company 's point of view it is important that we get as good a board as possible , " mr fjell said .
" we should have people with different backgrounds to make sure that we have a diversity so that any issue or any decision can be looked at from different perspectives .

cardiff appears in the top 10 of the prison reform trust 's table on problems of drug misuse , with more than 20 % of inmates reported to have failed random tests .
sir david ramsbotham set prisons targets the figure was down on 2000-2001 , when a quarter of inmates were found to be failing the testing procedure and the drop may reflect greater efforts to prevent drugs entering cardiff prison .
swansea scored highly on discipline , though , with very few reports of assaults on prison staff .
usk prison was found to be the best performing centre , while the privately-run parc prison at bridgend showed up well on inmate activity levels and on efforts to control drug problems .
the report coincides with the prison service 's warning to the uk government that prisons are overcrowded .
for some drug use in prison follows peer pressure linda quinn , drugs misuse consultant the reform trust 's latest figures show that drug abuse at cardiff prison is almost double the uk average of 11.6 % , while the level of purposeful activity is four hours under the target of 24 hours per week .
cardiff 's prison 500-strong population is largely young and local , with many inmates on remand .
but the low levels of assaults at cardiff - 6.4 % compared with a uk average of 9 % - will give prison chiefs some relief .
exemplary record swansea prison also has work to do to meet uk targets for tackling drug abuse , with 16.1 % , and activity hours - 22 - but it was one of the best establishments for discipline with an assault rate of just 1.9 % .
usk 's record over the past 12 months has been exemplary , says the trust , with an assault rate of just 0.3 % , almost double the uk 's prisoner activity levels -lrb- 37.9 hours -rrb- and a drug abuse rate of 3.6 % .
parc prison 's statistics matched the prison service 's targets , with assault rates and drug misuse levels within levels sought and an above average number of hours spent on purposeful activities .
linda quinn , a drugs misuse consultant working at cardiff prison , said tackling the drugs issue in south wales was difficult .
" for some drug use in prison follows peer pressure .
they are pressurised to confirm and there is the opportunity .
" more money has been directed in the past five years for providing education and help to address their drug use .
" prisoners in cardiff and swansea are spending relatively short times there and it is also proven to be difficult to police drugs coming into a prison .
" with lots of people coming in and out warders have a hard task .
prison gives prisoners an opportunity to come to terms with their drug use and find ways to tackle it . "
mark leach , a former prisoner and the director of the institute for prison law , said the issue of positive activities in prison was underestimated .
" i know of one prison where inmates were doing nothing more than folding bin liners and putting stickers on them .
" how prisons often interpret purposeful activities can be wide of the mark .

ms clark 's labour party , which won 52 of the 120 seats in parliament , formed a coalition with its close ally the left-leaning progressive coalition , which won two seats .
labour also reached agreement with the united future party , whose nine mps will now back the government on votes of confidence and budget issues , though the united future party will not be a formal member of the coalition .
the opposition national party was trounced in the election but the green party has declined to give ms clark parliamentary support due to a disagreement over genetically modified food and livestock .
labour plans to lift a moratorium on the commercial release of genetically modified organisms , while the greens want the ban to stay .
" labour 's bottom line that the moratorium ... must be lifted in october next year means that we are unable to reach common ground , " said co-leader of the greens , jeanette fitzsimons .
meanwhile , new zealand 's main opposition has launched an investigation into the rout it suffered at the election .
the centre-right national party lost nearly a third of their seats after a campaign derided both by analysts and from within the party as flawed and ineffectual .
the party , which dominated new zealand politics for decades after world war ii , now has just 27 parliamentary seats .
clark will spell out her plans for the next three years at the opening of parliament on 27 august .
labour campaigned to spend more on health , education , and defence , and to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate warming .

ms clark 's labour party , which won 52 of the 120 seats in parliament , formed a coalition with its close ally the left-leaning progressive coalition , which won two seats .
labour also reached agreement with the united future party , whose nine mps will now back the government on votes of confidence and budget issues , though the united future party will not be a formal member of the coalition .
but the green party has declined to give ms clark parliamentary support due to a disagreement over genetically modified food and livestock .
labour plans to lift a moratorium on the commercial release of genetically modified organisms , while the greens want the ban to stay .
" labour 's bottom line that the moratorium ... must be lifted in october next year means that we are unable to reach common ground , " said co-leader of the greens , jeanette fitzsimons .
meanwhile , new zealand 's main opposition has launched an investigation into the rout it suffered at the election .
the centre-right national party lost nearly a third of their seats after a campaign derided both by analysts and from within the party as flawed and ineffectual .
the party , which dominated new zealand politics for decades after world war ii , now has just 27 parliamentary seats .
clark will spell out her plans for the next three years at the opening of parliament on 27 august .
labour campaigned to spend more on health , education , and defence , and to ratify the kyoto protocol on climate warming .

receiving a flood warning via text message or cancelling a hospital appointment on e-mail could be reality in the uk within two years , say officials .
the british government is exploring new ways of putting citizens in touch with public services , as part of its commitment to put all services online by 2005 .
ministers are keen to engage the public in a more direct way and using popular technologies to deliver relevant services could achieve this goal .
electronic alerts for things such as court appearances , flood warnings , driving tests and hospital appointments are the latest response to criticisms that e-government so far has failed to capture the public 's imagination .

the system will use xml-based software that will allow government departments to cherry-pick the services they want from a central computer .
a flood warning service is currently being tested and could be in place in 12 months .
by 2004 , people should be able to set up , change and cancel appointments for services , such as driving tests or hospital visits , electronically .

the standing ovation for his performance in the capital 's comedy theatre was given by an audience peppered with celebrities including actors hugh grant and john hurt .
also there was harrelson 's former lover , fatal attraction star glenn close , who will make her british stage debut next month in a street car named desire at london 's national theatre .
the two actors are following a long line of hollywood stars who have chosen to take small salaries to act in the west end .
hugh grant signed autographs for fans nicole kidman , gwyneth paltrow , madonna , kevin spacey , matt damon , jessica lange and darryl hannah have all starred in west end productions .
hollywood guarantees hot ticket status and with the notable exception of madonna - who split critics - they have had good reviews .
in on an average day harrelson and maclachlan play estranged brothers .
maclachlan 's character returns home after 15 years to find his troubled younger brother has retreated into a bizarre private world .
john hurt was among the audience harrelson 's character finds himself in trouble with the authorities after an altercation with a motorist who has offered him a lift .
it comes after recent difficult times for the star in london , after harrelson , 41 , was arrested in june on suspicion of causing criminal damage after an incident in the back of a london cab .
but cab driver les dartnell withdrew his complaint and will not face charges .
the actor paid £ 542.96 to the driver for repairs .
harrelson later insisted he had torn the ashtray off the door by accident but admitted he had been an " idiot " in running off .
transvestite role the star of natural born killers and indecent proposal , who shot to fame as dim-witted barman woodie boyd in cheers , was a notorious hellraiser in his younger years .
he has battled against drink and drugs problems but has now settled down with wife laura and young daughters deni and zoe , who were at the play 's after-show party at london club adam street .
his next film will be in anger management , in which he has a cameo role as a transvestite prostitute opposite jack nicholson and adam sandler .
maclachlan , 43 , was seen most recently in us series sex and the city , and is also famed for starring in cult tv series twin peaks and the david lynch film blue velvet .

but if the laws to ban them from a third term , or even from remaining the heads of their parties , were intended to diminish their influence over the country 's politics , it has been an exercise in futility . "
if the idea of the exercise was to create some kind of democratic culture in the political parties ... it has not worked " though technically both mr sharif and ms bhutto will not be leading their parties into the october elections , they continue to command the respect of their supporters , and are calling the shots from exile .
with the internal party elections required under the new laws now over , pakistan 's election process has entered its second phase .
more than 70 parties , big and small , have complied with the new laws and submitted their party consitutions and the results of ballots to elect office bearers for inspection by the election commission .
now it is up to the commission to decide which of these parties fulfills the requirements and can be allotted a party symbol - essential in rural areas where illiteracy rates are high - for the coming elections .
old guard stay in place because of the restrictions imposed under the new electoral laws , nawaz sharif opted out as the president of his pakistan muslim league , or pml-n .
but on his instructions , his younger brother , shahbaz - who also lives in exile in saudi arabia - was unanimously elected as his replacement .
benazir bhutto decided not to relinquish the post of chairperson of her pakistan people 's party .
instead , a new entity by the name of the pakistan people 's party parliamentarians , or ppp-p , was set-up with her second-in-command , makhdoom amin fahim , being elected as its head .
most of the other important parties also re-elected the same old leaders , many of them even without any real contest .
so , if the idea of the exercise was to create some kind of democratic culture in the political parties - a claim made by the government in support of the new laws - it has not worked .
charisma and this is understandable .
as in most other countries in south asia , pakistani politics are dominated by powerful personalities . "
perhaps the only difference in the october vote will be that some of these prominent personalities ... may not be able to return to the country " political parties are identified with their leaders , rather than their programmes and manifestos .
and the phenomenon is not just restricted to sharifs or bhuttos .
whether it 's imran khan 's tehrik-e-insaaf or former president farooq leghari 's millat party , or even altaf hussain 's mqm , they all revolve round their respective leaders .
the next general election is likely to be dominated by these political personalities , and the results will depend on their ability to mobilise supporters through their charisma .
absences perhaps the only difference in the october vote will be that some of these prominent personalities , presently living in exile , may not be able to return to the country to lead their parties into the elections .
neither nawaz sharif , or even his brother shahbaz , are likely to be allowed to leave saudi arabia .
the mqm 's altaf hussain is living in exile in london , and is not expected to return to pakistan in the near future .
and even though ms bhutto keeps saying she intends to return home before the elections , so far the fear of getting arrested on charges of corruption has prevented her from doing so .
this gives an added advantage to the pro-government parties .
in fact , some analysts say the whole idea of introducing these new electoral laws was for this purpose alone .
now it will be interesting to see how senior politicians like ms bhutto or mr sharif play their cards to try to get back into the political mainstream .

so , if the idea of the exercise was to create some kind of democratic culture in the political parties - a claim made by the government in support of the new laws - it has not worked .
charisma and this is understandable .
as in most other countries in south asia , pakistani politics are dominated by powerful personalities .
perhaps the only difference in the october vote will be that some of these prominent personalities ... may not be able to return to the country political parties are identified with their leaders , rather than their programmes and manifestos .
and the phenomenon is not just restricted to sharifs or bhuttos .
whether it 's imran khan 's tehrik-e-insaaf or former president farooq leghari 's millat party , or even altaf hussain 's mqm , they all revolve round their respective leaders .
the next general election is likely to be dominated by these political personalities , and the results will depend on their ability to mobilise supporters through their charisma .
absences perhaps the only difference in the october vote will be that some of these prominent personalities , presently living in exile , may not be able to return to the country to lead their parties into the elections .
benazir now lives in self-imposed exile abroad neither nawaz sharif , or even his brother shahbaz , are likely to be allowed to leave saudi arabia .
the mqm 's altaf hussain is living in exile in london , and is not expected to return to pakistan in the near future .
and even though ms bhutto keeps saying she intends to return home before the elections , so far the fear of getting arrested on charges of corruption has prevented her from doing so .
this gives an added advantage to the pro-government parties .
in fact , some analysts say the whole idea of introducing these new electoral laws was for this purpose alone .
now it will be interesting to see how senior politicians like ms bhutto or mr sharif play their cards to try to get back into the political mainstream .

federal agents in tijuana have arrested dr francisco javier valentin y ortiz , who worked at a state-run clinic .
he is accused of negligent injury , medical malpractice and performing surgery without the proper medical certification .
the alleged amputation happened in september 2000 when a man visited the clinic for a routine circumcision operation , in which only the foreskin of the penis is removed .
this is a relatively technically simple operation , which can be carried out under local anaesthetic with the patient allowed to go home shortly afterwards .
bleeding risks include excessive bleeding - the removal of too much or too little skin , or cosmetic results which do not please the patient .
full recovery requires four to six weeks of abstinence from sexual activity .
there are many reasons why adults may want to be circumcised , including medical conditions which make them prone to infection , and cultural or social reasons .
the name of the patient in this case has not been released .
officials said that the arrested surgeon was licenced only as a general surgeon and not qualified to perform circumcisions , which require a specialisation in urology .
