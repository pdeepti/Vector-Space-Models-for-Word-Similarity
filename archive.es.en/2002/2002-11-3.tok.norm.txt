harry potter is ready once more for battle with the lord of the rings for the undisputed title of the year 's biggest movie .
in the left hand corner , the second screen instalment of the jk rowling children 's phenomenon : harry potter and the chamber of secrets .
in the right , the lord of the rings : the two towers - next in the three-part adaptation of jr tolkien 's sword-and-sorcery fantasy .
at stake is a worldwide market worth a fortune in box office receipts , merchandising spin-offs and dvd and video sales .
rivalry between them , the first potter and rings films brought in a wizardly $ 1.82bn -lrb- £ 1.17bn -rrb- at cinemas around the globe .
harry potter and the philosopher 's stone raked in $ 961m -lrb- £ 618m -rrb- to become the second highest grossing movie of all time behind titanic .
its middle-earth rival , the fellowship of the ring , made $ 860m -lrb- £ 553m -rrb- , emerging as the biggest film of all time in new zealand , norway and denmark .
as the bout stands , then , harry is ahead on points - to the tune of more than $ 100m -lrb- £ 64m -rrb- .
but huge though this amount is , the rivalry is closer than it appears .
in the uk , the first potter took $ 93m -lrb- £ 60m -rrb- against $ 90m -lrb- £ 58m -rrb- for rings .
triumph in the us , the gap was similarly small - $ 317m -lrb- £ 204m -rrb- for harry against $ 313m -lrb- £ 201m -rrb- for frodo baggins and co .
in most of the world 's cinema-going nations it was a close-run contest .
only in japan did potter triumph by a massive margin , taking in excess of $ 100m more than its competitor , with receipts of $ 163m -lrb- £ 105m -rrb- .
and so the far east looks like holding the key to deciding whether harry 's second term at hogwarts will pull in more young customers than gandalf and friends .
whatever the result , it all adds up to pre-christmas glee for uk cinemas , already celebrating a record-breaking 40-year box office high after a blockbuster year .
the world premiére of the potter sequel is in london on sunday at the odeon cinema in leicester square .
roles the film is said to be darker and scarier than its predecessor , with harry -lrb- daniel radcliffe -rrb- confronting a sinister force terrorising hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry .
kenneth branagh has joined the cast as gilderoy lockhart , the school 's new professor of defence against the dark arts .
there are repeat roles for alan rickman , maggie smith , robbie coltrane and the late richard harris .
directed again by chris columbus , it contains a wealth of spectacular action scenes - from a flying ford anglia car to a high-octane quidditch match .
the film opens uk-wide on 15 november , giving it more than a month to get a head start on rings , which debuts on 18 december .
adding further magic to this year 's contest , the two heavyweights face even more competition - in the guise of urbane british secret agent 007 .
the new bond movie , die another day , opens five days after potter and is sure to appeal to a section of the audience that will seek out the big two blockbusters .
duel some film industry observers have questioned whether uk cinemas have the capacity to cope with three such hugely popular films at the same time .
during last year 's potter vs rings duel , many multiplexes were effectively taken over by young audiences intent on seeing nothing but the big two .
" these films do what we call ' saturation releases ' , " says charles gant , films editor at heat magazine .
" harry potter and lord of the rings were the first films to come out on 1,000 screens in the uk and there was a feeling that every multiplex would be overtaken .
" the fact that there 's now another huge blockbuster - bond - with a very successful franchise is amazing .
expectations " there will be room for other things , but i have visions of 10-screen multiplexes playing them non-stop .
" we do have enough screens to cope because there have been so many new screens .
" a lot of these cinemas started going bankrupt and the market suffered from over-screenage .
but the big films have come through in time to save their bacon .
" three films in five weeks is good news for cinemas that have already had their best ever year at the box office . "
whether the potter and rings sequels can quite live up to last year 's critical and commercial expectations remains to be seen .
but not even james bond looks tough , clever or cool enough to get in their way .

four men and one woman were arrested in two separate raids in london on saturday morning by officers from scotland yard 's serious and organised crime command unit , known as so7 .
another four people , including a second woman , were arrested in further operations conducted late on saturday and early on sunday , police said . "
it 's clear these people were serious and that , of course , has scared the life out of me " victoria beckham victoria beckham - married to manchester united and england footballer david beckham - said she was in " absolute and total shock " at the revelations .
scotland yard acted after receiving information from a sunday newspaper about an alleged plan .
the nine are being held at unnamed police stations across london , where they are being questioned about conspiracy to kidnap and theft .
at least five of those being held are understood to be romanian or albanian .
one of the raids was armed and in london 's docklands area , while another was on a residential premises in morden , south london .
' terrifying ' the news of the world said undercover reporters had infiltrated a gang of art thieves and discovered they were also planning to kidnap the former spice girl .
she told the newspaper : " it 's clear these people were serious and that , of course , has scared the life out of me .
" it 's terrifying to think that someone would want to do that to you and your children . "
she said she would be talking to her security team , adding : " but if people want to do this to my family how can you be 100 % sure you 'll prevent it ? "
news of the world managing editor stuart kuttner told bbc news 24 his reporters had become extremely close to the gang of art thieves , with one " recruited as a potential getaway driver " .
he said the gang would have been happy to kidnap the couple 's two young sons , three-year-old brooklyn and baby romeo , as well .
" the plan was to kidnap victoria beckham , to take with her either or both the children if perchance they were with her ... to secrete them in a safe house and to demand a ransom of £ 5m , " he said .
the paper said the gang planned to sedate victoria with a chemical spray and hold her in a house in brixton , south london .
deputy editor andy coulson said the plans were fairly well formed .
previous threat " they knew where they were going to carry out the kidnap , they knew how , they knew when , " he said .
detective chief superintendent john coles , the head of so7 , said : " we are very grateful to the news of the world for their actions in this case which have assisted in the recovery of a number of valuable items and in preventing any other offences . "
mrs beckham was told of the plot before watching her england captain husband play at old trafford on saturday afternoon .
she did not tell her husband until after the match .
it is not the first time the beckhams have been targeted .
in january 2000 a plot emerged to snatch mrs beckham and her son brooklyn while her husband was playing for england in a match at wembley was foiled by police .
the celebrity family were moved to a safe house for 48 hours , but no arrests were made because the kidnappers never got past the planning stage , and left no written evidence .
after the first kidnapping incident , victoria told michael parkinson on his chat show the couple had hired a bodyguard for brooklyn .

here 's a selection of your views : it seems a little strange that we consider it too dangerous to allow properly vetted and licensed adults to have hand guns yet anyone can walk into a corner shop and buy explosives .
terry hyde , coventry my first memory of fireworks is unpleasant .
a family friend was hit by a damp flare which resulted in facial injury .
this was not set of by a person under 18 yrs of age but a middle aged father who was intoxicated .
despite that , i now enjoy firework displays and am planning a small display at home .
helen alcock-towse , lincoln by trying remove all risks from our growing children we stop them learning the responsible level of risk taking .
banning fireworks is just another step in this process of trying to blame someone else for our own inability to have fun but take responsibility .
neil , bristol if the newspaper editor is serious about banning dangerous items to the public , i assume he will be campaigning for banning cars from the streets next .
more people are killed per year by cars than by fireworks .
he should visit the planet and get in touch with reality before trying to ruin people 's fun in this life .
ken forbes , perth , scotland we should ban fireworks .
last night in birmingham , trick or treaters where throwing bangers into the drives of houses where they did n't get any treats .
a case against both fireworks and trick or treating peter pinner , birmingham many people enjoy putting on their own firework displays - and i am one of them .
people should realise it 's kids getting their hands on fireworks from newsagents that cause all the problems .
limit firework sales to reputable dealers and stop under 21 's buying them .
do n't take liberties away from one group of people because of the actions of others .
max bardwell , nottingham these days fireworks start at least a month before guy fawkes night and continue until after christmas .
apart from the injuries , the fireworks are getting larger -lrb- bigger bang -rrb- this is frightening all animals the practice should be stopped .
only commercial firework displays should be allowed .
with no sale to the public .
mike gilmore , worthing being woken up at two in the morning by some thick-necked lager lout is no fun .
idiots buy loud fireworks simply for their nuisance value .
fireworks now should only be used for public displays chris cyrnick , nottinghamshire it is time that the sale of fireworks to the public was banned .
we are told each year to bring our pets in on bonfire night - unfortunately the bangs go on regularly from mid-october to after the new year .
our local rspca shelter -lrb- which looks after small animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs -rrb- has animals die of fright each year .
i wonder how many wild animals die too ?
rosemary moll , medway why should everyone be punished because of some immature individuals ?
after all , rocks would be dangerous in the wrong hands , would n't they ?

the small limestone box , known as an ossuary , is thought to have contained the bones of james , the brother of jesus .
incipient cracks grew and other cracks appeared dan rahimi , royal ontario museum it is inscribed in aramaic with the words " james , son of joseph , brother of jesus " and has been dated to about the year 63 ad .
officials from toronto 's royal ontario museum said new cracks had appeared in the ancient burial casket when it was unpacked after being shipped from tel aviv in israel via new york .
dan rahimi , the director of collections management , said : " in transit there must have been further impact to the piece , or some kind of damage ...
" we ca n't really tell , but incipient cracks grew and other cracks appeared . "
christ 's family tree he said the box - which is about 50 centimetres -lrb- 20 inches -rrb- long and valued at $ 2m - was still intact but there was concern that the new cracks , bigger than a hairline , could make it unstable .
one of the cracks - which can be treated - runs through the inscription which is a key part of the ossuary being considered as evidence for the existence of jesus .
the damage suffered on the journey may make the casket unstable although james , joseph and jesus were all common names in ancient times , the combination of a james with a brother called jesus and a father called joseph - the family tree mentioned in the new testament - would have been rarer .
also significant is the mention of the dead person 's brother on the casket , which would only have happened if the brother was well-known , according to a french specialist in ancient inscriptions , andre lemaire , who revealed the casket 's existence last month .
mr lemaire , writing in the biblical archaeology review , said jews at the time of jesus routinely transferred bones of the dead from burial caves to ossuaries .
' first ' artefact if the ossuary is authentic , it may be the most important find in the history of new testament archaeology and the earliest known non-biblical reference to jesus , some academics believe .
experts do not doubt the existence of a person called jesus , but almost everything known about him comes from writings in the new testament .
there are no other verified artefacts from the first century .
the owner of the box is reported to have bought it for a few hundred dollars in the 1970s and been unaware of its possible significance .
the museum in toronto plans to exhibit the ossuary from 16 november to 29 december .

china telecom , for years the state-owned monopoly and still the biggest player in china , had been due to release the shares to the new york market on 6 november and in hong kong on 7 november .
but the flotation was delayed due to weak demand from investors .
" we could reduce the size substantially , and we are still working on a number of issues , " one banker told reuters .
" the size of the deal could be cut in half . "
major blow selling just 10 % of china telecom would still bring in substantial investment .
but given that the initial ambition had been the sale of 20 % of the giant it would be a climbdown in terms of prestige .
the initial target would have made the flotation the third largest in the world this year .
the failure to reach the target has also raised concerns in china about the likely success of future privatisations .
controversial the flotation had already kicked up a storm in the " special administrative region " of hong kong , after plans were unveiled to boost the cost of calling the mainland by 750 % , from 2 us cents a minute to 17 cents .
the proposal , which critics said could cost businesses , more than $ 5,000 more a month , drew howls of anger from hong kong .
investors are cautious about investing given that at least 80 % of the company will remain in the hands of the state , not least because of china 's history of rapid changes in regulation of the phone business .
it is only a few months since the snap decision was made to create two new companies to compete with ct and its main rival , unicom .
that " regulatory risk " may be too much for investors to stomach unless the offer is improved .
but the price per share can not come down much further than the hk $ 1.48 low end of its range without undercutting the book value set by the government at hk $ 1.46 , a move currently banned by beijing .
