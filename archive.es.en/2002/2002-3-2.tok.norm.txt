the group told the bbc it hoped to recover hundreds of millions of pounds lost by its investors when mr byers put railtrack plc into administration last year .
mr byers said the company was insolvent when he got the courts to close it down on 7 october last year .
but railtrack group , which owned railtrack plc and is still operating , believes its subsidiary was trading profitably at the time .
in december , the group reported profits of £ 292m for the six months before railtrack plc was put into administration .
compensation railtrack group 's corporate affairs director sue clark has told the bbc 's money box programme the company is about to go to court to force the government to disclose key documents to help it prove its case .
she said court action would begin before the end of the month and warned shareholders to keep their share certificates .
railtrack group will ask the courts for compensation to bring the value of the shares back to £ 3.60 - the price shareholders paid when the company was privatised in may 1996 .
the shares , which were worth £ 17 at one point , were trading at £ 2.80 when they were suspended .
at the time mr byers said the firm 's balance sheet and " failure to deliver " desired results had left him with no option but to press for railtrack to be put into administration .
train crashes cash projections at the time predicted a railtrack deficit of £ 700m within a month , and £ 1.7bn by march , he said .
the transport secretary ruled out a compensation package for railtrack 's 225,000 shareholders , which included many employees .
since its privatisation in 1996 , railtrack has came under fire for making profits even though passengers suffered a poor service on a decrepit rail network .
its unpopularity was sealed with the ladbroke grove and hatfield and selby train crashes , which all highlighted safety shortcomings in the network .

at least five palestinians and an israeli solder were killed on friday - as gunbattles raged from house to house and alley to alley in the crowded west bank camps of balata and jenin .
one of the victims was a 10-year-old girl , who palestinian officials said had been hit by fire from an israeli helicopter in jenin .
the army said the assaults were meant to root out militants and deny them a safe haven in the camps , but reports said most of the wanted men had slipped out of the camps to new hiding places .
the raids , which followed a palestinian suicide bombing at an army checkpoint on wednesday , have marked israel 's fiercest attacks against refugee camps in 17 months of conflict . "
it 's a new massacre against the palestinian people " yasser arafat reports said house-to-house searches were carried out by troops smashing through walls of the cramped buildings - which have housed palestinian refugee families since the creation of israel in 1948 .
palestinian president yasser arafat urged international action to halt what he called a " new massacre " .
" i call upon the whole world to act quickly before a state of chaos engulfs the whole middle east region , " he said from the west bank town of ramallah , where he has been pinned down by israel since december .
the united nations human rights commissioner , mary robinson , condemned the israeli incursions - in which more than 150 people have also been injured - as a violation of international humanitarian law .
the united states has repeatedly urged israel to exercise restraint but stopped short of calling for a withdrawal from the camps .
" we are in touch with the israeli government to urge that utmost restraint be exercised in order to avoid harm to the civilian population , " state department spokesman richard boucher said .
" we believe it 's extremely important that every possible effort be made to avoid harm to civilians . "
" the next steps mean maximum efforts by the palestinian authority to confront violence and terror and steps by the israeli government to facilitate palestinian efforts " richard boucher the palestinian authority has said it is suspending all contacts with israel " as long as the destructive israeli aggression continues " .
in the gaza strip , palestinian officials said a seven-year-old palestinian boy was killed by israeli gunfire in the village of beit lahya on friday .
a military spokeswoman said the army was investigating the incident .
she denied a claim by a neighbour of the boy who said he saw a soldier beckon the child towards his tank , which then opened fire .
the incursions marked the first time that israel has stormed refugee camps since the latest uprising erupted in september 2000 .
clashes continued into friday evening in jenin , but 30 kilometres -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- to the south in balata , the fighting was said to have died down .
on thursday , 13 palestinians and an israeli soldier died in fierce battles on the outskirts of the jenin and balata refugee camps .
palestinian officials - and some critical israeli commentators - suggested the raids were timed to overshadow a saudi diplomatic initiative , which has caused some fragile hopes for peace in recent days .
the state department spokesman said the saudi ideas served " as a promise of better life for all the regions , should the parties find a way to end violence and once again resume their negotiations " .
but he insisted above all that the palestinian authority must make " maximum efforts to confront violence and terror " .
pressure has been growing from the israeli right and left for prime minister ariel sharon to do more to end the palestinian revolt against israel 's occupation in the west bank and gaza strip .
an opinion poll in the maariv newspaper showed that for the first time since sharon 's election a year ago a majority of israelis , 53 % , was dissatisfied with his performance .

the overall theme is the search for roots , from the 15th-century kingdom of al-andalus in southern spain to the common roots shared by all muslims via the koran and the shared experience of muslim women .
organisers have said that , in order to make the debate as open and diverse as possible , men and non-muslims are welcome .

the avatars are computer animations designed to look and move like real people .
a computer program takes spoken english and converts it in real-time to text .
the digital avatars then take this english text and sign its meaning on a display screen , in effect becoming a translator between spoken english and british sign language .
coming to post offices this may sound like star trek technology , but it is about to be piloted in post offices in the uk .
real-time translation could take a decade with a computer screen displaying the signing avatar , a deaf or hard of hearing person can communicate with a postal worker and complete their transactions .
this post office avatar is not a totally fluent translator , however .
it can only work with set and constrained phrases .
this is because , at the moment , the avatars are all grammar-based , which means they can only take written text , like a newspaper , and translate it into sign language .
when it comes to a conversation that is oral and in real time , the technology is not yet sophisticated enough for avatars to simultaneously translate between english and british sign language .
nor could they translate a television or a radio broadcast .
experts say it may take a decade before we see that level of translation .
one of the breakthroughs the avatars could deliver is eliminating the need to book british sign language interpreters .
great potential at the moment , there are only 80 trained interpreters in the entire uk , which can mean you need to book an interpreter up to two months in advance .
current post offices have no signing facilities this is no use to you if you are deaf or hard of hearing and need to go to an emergency room , much less a more casual trip to a doctor or a business partner .
the potential is high , though .
imagine a perfectly fluent avatar on your handheld computer , able to translate in real-time between english and sign language .
synchronise this programme with text messaging and mobile phones , technologies already embraced by deaf and hard of hearing users , and you have tools that could reshape the daily communication experiences of this community .
businesses should pursue this technology , and not just because it is the right thing to do .
the deaf and hard of hearing account for 8.6 million of the 59 million people in the uk .
combine that with the millions throughout the world who would also benefit , and a huge market opportunity emerges for the right products .
you can hear jon wurtzel on go digital , which is webcast on bbc news online every monday at 1500 gmt .
or you can listen to the programme on bbc world service radio on tuesdays , wednesdays and thursdays .
