about 400 people marched on hong kong 's court of final appeal , where their requests to meet officials were turned down .
the hong kong authorities have started issuing removal letters to up to 4,300 chinese-born people now living in the territory after a deadline for them to stay ran out on sunday . "
i 'll kill myself if they forcibly repatriate me " wong mei-yin the abode-seekers , whose parents have the right to stay in hong kong , want the government to reconsider because families would be split apart .
government officials say they are ready to search the streets for people from mainland china who lack residency rights .
officials said " routine " and " special " operations would be mounted to find and remove people who did not surrender to the authorities .
the government has so far sent out 300 letters telling people to report to immigration offices for repatriation .
defiance but several marchers interviewed by journalists said they would not obey the order .
wong mei-yin , 32 , told reuters news agency : " i 'll kill myself if they forcibly repatriate me .
at least if i die in hong kong , my family can deal with my remains .
" i have no relative on the mainland " .
the migrants were born in mainland china and have spent years trying to win the right of abode with their parents in the territory .
the deadline for them to leave was set after migrants lost a final legal case earlier this year .
the hong kong authorities insist there can be no negotiations .
" if people report voluntarily to the immigration department , they will be repatriated , " deputy security secretary michael wong said .
" if they choose not to do so , then they have absconded . "
the only people whose removal would be delayed were those with legal action pending , mr wong added .
our correspondent damian grammaticas says some of the people now facing deportation are as young as six years old , though many are teenagers or older .
among those told to leave are one of a pair of twin girls and a 70-year-old man who lives in hong kong caring for his 90-year-old father .
the abode-seekers are particularly bitter because they were initially granted the right to live with their parents three years ago .
but hong kong 's authorities , with the help of the central government in beijing , removed those rights , citing the need to limit immigration to the territory .

"
i just despair of what is happening and yet there is no condemnation from our prime minister " labour mp tam dalyell veteran labour mp tam dalyell asked house of commons speaker michael martin to extend wednesday 's emergency recall of parliament to include a statement and a short debate on the isreali palestinian conflict .
parliament is being recalled for three hours as a mark of respect for the queen mother , who died on saturday .
downing street is reported to have rejected mr dalyell 's request , as isreali tanks moved into bethlehem in the latest of a series of raids on cities in the west bank .
' moral obligation ' mr dalyell - the longest-serving member - welcomed the decision to recall parliament to allow mps to give their tributes to the queen mother .
but he said prime minister tony blair had a " moral obligation " to hear what the house of commons had to say about the conflict ahead of his meeting with us president george bush .
he told the mirror newspaper : " i just despair of what is happening and yet there is no condemnation from our prime minister .
" i want him to tell sharon -lrb- ariel sharon , israel 's president -rrb- that his policy has no hope of success , it is making everything worse .
" and for the prime minister to be thinking of attacking iraq at such a time is sheer folly . "
paying tribute george galloway , mp for glasgow kelvin , told the independent newspaper he did not wish to be disrespectful to the queen mother .
but he said the uk had a " special responsibility " for the crisis in the middle east and he said there should be an adjournment debate on the issue .
his view was supported by backbench labour colleagues jeremy corbyn and david hinchliffe .
" obviously the purpose of the recall is to pay tribute to the queen mother .
" but we have got to live in the real world and , looking at the seriousness of the situation , i would be supportive of at least some form of statement , " mr hinchliffe told the independent .
recess earlier , downing street confirmed that the prime minister will go ahead with his planned meeting with president bush in the united states at the weekend .
the talks have the full agreement of buckingham palace and tony blair will be back for the funeral on tuesday .
the house of commons and house of lords are currently in recess for the easter break , and the commons was not due to sit again until tuesday 9 april , a day after the lords was to return - and the day of the queen mother 's funeral .
mr blair will lead tributes in the house of commons , followed by conservative leader iain duncan smith , liberal democrat leader charles kennedy and father of the house national importance the leader of the house of lords , lord williams of mostyn , is expected to lead peers ' tributes , followed by conservative leader of the lords , lord strathclyde .
it is only at times of great national importance that the houses of parliament hold sittings during their scheduled breaks .
in autumn last year the house of commons was recalled in the wake of the 11 september terror attacks on the us and subsequent military action in afghanistan .
the move is normally taken when a general election is imminent , during a national emergency or when there is a threat to uk security .
when the queen mother 's husband , king george vi , died in february 1952 , parliament was already sitting but a day was set aside to enable mps and peers to pay tributes .

a researcher at a scottish university is setting up a scheme to collect surplus machines and send them to schools in his native uganda .
" most of the computers have been decommissioned , because the institutions which were using them are upgrading , " said dr morris agaba , a research fellow at stirling university .
so far he has collected 50 fully functioning computers , which he hopes to send to a secondary school in uganda by july .
' critical tool ' dr agaba first thought of the idea of recycling computers two years ago , but it was only when he teamed up with some colleagues over coffee that the whole thing came together .
he saw how every year , hundreds of thousands of working computers are scrapped as institutions and companies buy the latest models .
as a ugandan who has studied abroad , dr agaba saw an opportunity to do something to help introduce children in his country to the computer age .
" i asked myself , how i could contribute something to the education of the children in fringe environments and i thought the most critical tool i could think of was computers , " he told the bbc programme go digital .
the first shipment of computers is destined for a school 250 kilometres northeast of the capital , kampala .
the school only has one computer which is used for administrative purposes , so its 1,000 pupils have probably never even seen a pc .
" the availability of computers will greatly enhance their studies and enhance their horizons , " said dr agaba .
net horizons the machines will have some basic software , such as word-processing and graphics programs .
but this is only the first step . "
this is something that can be done wherever there are surplus computers " morris agaba " most important from my perspective is if they can get connected to the internet , as they will have a door open to the vast amount of information available there , " he said .
dr agaba is currently looking at cost effective ways of shipping the machines to uganda and even sending out volunteers to train the school teachers .
so far most of the surplus computers have come from the university of stirling .
but he believes that there are many more machines which would be thrown away , unless someone offered to take them .
" this is something that can be done wherever there are surplus computers , not just in the uk but also in the us , " he said .

zimbabwe has been suspended from the commonwealth for a year with immediate effect .
the decision was taken by the commonwealth " troika " which was mandated to review the presidential elections in zimbabwe .
leaders of australia , nigeria and south africa agreed with commonwealth observers that the campaign had been marred by violence and intimidation .
the poll was also criticized by the usa , the european union and the uk .
was the commonwealth right to suspend zimbabwe ?
what difference will this decision make ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction " i feel it 's very wrong to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth " barrats , india / uk i feel it 's very wrong to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth .
i think the very reason behind this is that president mugabe won the election which barred the chances of uk , usa and western european countries to set up a puppet government and get all their wishes done .
the winning of mugabe has given some chance to breath , struggle and strive for their own good barrats , india / uk i believe that all the people in the country will suffer .
the poor will suffer the most .
barbados the commonwealth is wasting its time .
mugabe has no intent of giving up power .
by hook or by crook , he will stay in power .
alan noma , canada like most other issues around the world , suspending zimbabwe does not solve the root cause of the matter - which is how can the real owners of the land in zimbabwe be given back their land oladimeji , nigeria the commonwealth is getting a little ahead of itself if it thinks suspension will achieve much - it 's a toothless organisation with no particular relevance , and certainly with very little resolve .
don mckinnon and his crowd could 've and should 've acted far more decisively in highlighting to the world the desperate state of zimbabwe before 2000 's general election .
it may have made a difference back then .
darren oldfield , uk " this is an incredible tragedy brought on by an old man desperately trying to keep himself in power " richard wisecarver , alaska i think that most of the news and commentary miss the point .
mugabe has damaged the country in several horrible ways .
he has laid the foundation for a long term civil war , and he has cut off all hope of real economic progress .
no one in his right mind would invest a dime in the country .
he has guaranteed that any successful investment would be ceased as a matter of course with the justification of racial revenge .
i can not picture sane investor from any part of the world , of any race throwing good money after bad .
there were many ways to put these contested lands back into the hands of the black majority .
this was the worst possible choice .
breaking commercial farms into subsistence farms is a guarantee of continuing poverty for those who take up those lands .
it takes away the homes and jobs of farm workers who live on the land already and it destroys a major source of export income that zimbabwe needs .
this is not to mention the food that they produce for the nation .
zimbabwe can not afford to import food that it should produce .
this is an incredible tragedy brought on by an old man desperately trying to keep himself in power at all costs .
i will predict that many thousands will die as a result of the impending civil war , economic chaos and the flight of world capital .
many third world countries struggle just to survive , while others like zimbabwe and palestine rush toward chaos and horror with eyes wide open .
richard wisecarver , wasilla , alaska the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth for mugabe 's hostilities , intimidation and elimination of civilian lives for his political survival is genuine and applauded .
even to impose economic sanction would n't be a bad idea to get mugabe to feel the pinch of his actions and draconian rule but it is only the ordinary citizens who will suffer the most .
dale , uk that was the most sensible thing for the commonwealth to do .
though too late .
it is surprising how some non zimbabweans glorify mugabe because of their rabid hatred for the west .
please fight your own wars with the colonialists and stop using zimbabweans .
the majority of the people who are being killed , maimed and displaced in zimbabwe are blacks and not white farmers .
the man does not like opposition and that is the reason for all our suffering .
i wish you could have a page for zimbabweans only and i tell you , you will be surprised what people will write .
lazarus , zimbabwe zimbabwe 's suspension from the commonwealth is too little too late .
the people of zimbabwe have suffered enough and for a long time under this despotic ruler .
suspension at this stage will hardly even scratch the surface in changing that .
as ordinary zimbabweans , we feel betrayed in a way , by the world and anyone who is in a position to help us out of this .
we want to be free .
the electoral process seemed to have failed us yet again because it can be rigged .
we have never known good governance .
could somebody out there please help !
vm , zimbabwe " why does the west feel that sanctions are the panacea in resolving the many problems in africa ? "
deckey boy , liberia why does the west feel that sanctions are the panacea in resolving the many problems in africa ?
sanctions have rather proven counterproductive as seen in libya , liberia , sudan etc .
they only the very people that are to be protected and drag the country into deeper destitution .
any sober-minded person can see that the sanctions imposed on zimbabwe are far from what transpired during the election .
great britain is only using this election issue as a stepping stone to get back at mugabe for his drastic land reform - all at the expense of poor zimbabweans .
my fellow africans when will we ever see the light ?
deckey boy , liberia i think zimbabwe should not have been suspended from the commonwealth , and the western world is interested in this matter only because of the white farmers in the country .
there have been many african elections like this one , but no western politician ever said anything about it .
and also , let 's look at george bush 's own election , as there are lots of questions to be asked about it .
smith , england " the west seems to care more for the white farmers , and possibly even their dogs , than it does about the rest of black africa " yanni mbandi , usa - cameroon the barbarism of dr mugabe 's followers appals me .
but a sense of justice constrains me from condemning it without also identifying its roots - britain 's own past treacheries .
the west seems to care more for the white farmers , and possibly even their dogs , than it does about the rest of black africa .
europeans and especially british are taking this election seriously because of the white farmers .
if britain is very serious about democracy in africa , it should be at the front at all times and not only in one special area .
there was little outcry when guinea held a referendum last year that paved the way for president lansana conte , a key western ally in the region , to rule for the duration of his life .
it is scandalous and hypocritical that there should be such obvious double standards , and we have to ask ourselves why that should be .
you will find answers in the reasons why africans were enslaved and colonized .
yanni mbandi , usa - cameroon the commonwealth was wrong to suspend zimbabwe because it means nothing at this stage .
the main difference now will be that the commonwealth as such lost the right to express any opinion or influence the situation in zimbabwe .
mugabe can not care less if he going to receive the offer of rejoining the club in a year or not .
this on the other hand , will give him even more space to continue his involvement in drc and sell out the country to libyan and other governments interested in territorial or mineral riches .
the only right solution in this situation is that mbeki and other sadc leaders wake up and realise that mugabe means trouble .
what do you do with a brother who hurts the family ?
you forgive him but you do n't let him hurt the family any more .
tsitsi , zim & uk the commonwealth has carried out it 's obligation to improve the human rights and democratic rights of the people of zimbabwe .
the rights of all zimbabweans are at stake here , not just a tribe , a race , a political party !
land issues are for the people of zimbabwe to decide democratically on , not to satisfy any other country .
alec , uk " we have to be happy because the colonial masters are realising that their time is up ! "
vusumzi mpongo , south africa the commonwealth suspends zimbabwe ...
so what ?
africans have to be happy about this .
we have to be happy because the colonial masters are realising that their time is up !
the commonwealth is a mechanism to monitor africans - a perpetuation of colonialism , and thus a tool for further oppression and suppression .
mugabe is giving africans a message : it is time we stood against oppression in all forms .
we must always refer to history .
it happened in the congo , and imperialism consumed lumumba .
puppets of imperialism entrapped , at their masters ' orders , and killed lumumba .
why ?
because he had vowed to stand firm against colonialism .
it is time for african renaissance , and that renaissance must start with africans seeking and getting their independence .
vusumzi mpongo , south africa mugabe and his cronies still have food on their tables while most of our relatives back home are starving .
it is about time some military or forceful means were used to rid the country of this tyrant , before he fools another strong opposition into forming a government of national unity !
charles bongani , uk yes sanctions were rightly imposed on zimbabwe , but its too little , too late .
they should have acted long ago , without giving the so-called hierarchy notice that it was going to happen .
those of you who have not seen what has come of zimbabwe in the last few years should not even have the nerve to air your arrogant remarks , without knowing the extent to which people are suffering , and the difficulties the average families have to survive .
economic , and regional ruin is what lies ahead if something is not done and done quick .
zanu pf made a mockery out of democracy .
i 'd rather the west interfere .
once proud zimbabwean , uk " mugabe 's behaviour towards his people has been far worse that the smith regime 's before him " mdy , an african in uk mugabe 's behaviour towards his people has been far worse that the smith regime 's before him .
he should be heavily sanctioned by all freedom loving people around the world for his treatment of the matebele , his own people , and his violation of the institution of democracy .
zimbabwe needs liberation .
mdy , an african in uk i strongly feel that the commonwealth should not have suspended zimbabwe .
this only will help worsen the already ailing and staggering economic situation in the country .
rather it should have taken particular measures against specific individuals which it claims are violating human rights .
my question is : who is a more serious human rights abuser , one who sponsors all these political clashes , wars and genocides or one who strives to get back what has been unlawfully taken away from him , that is the land itself in this case ?
let zimbabweans solve their domestic disputes alone .
n. mutoworera , zimbabwe excellent move , although i am positive it will not affect mugabe !
he wants the land for his ' people ' but what have they done with the land ?
they are incapable of thinking for themselves to farm grain and provide for their people .
independence was won in 1980 and yet the black man has not risen up and shown the world what he can do with the country .
c alexander , south african " i never knew that the commonwealth still existed ! "
anock banda , proud african i never knew that the commonwealth still existed !
well pretty much leaves blair thinking he had the last laugh .
other than that you ca n't do anything about adding sanctions , and if you do then it just states that the west cares less about unimportant countries , for example zambia .
anock banda , proud african i do not care what sanctions the west imposes on us , as long as we can get back our land , have somewhere to live on and grow our own food .
soon the west will be a laughing stock for africa .
luke , zimbabwe i really do n't know what the international community gains from sanctions against the so-called dictators .
the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth would not yield a better life for zimbabweans , but it will bring about great suffering and bitterness among politicians .
i do n't support unnecessary interference of the west into african politics .
however , the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth should be a lesson to many african politicians , that if they think african politics should be left to africans , they should learn to protect and respect the rights of all citizens in the respective countries .
mwape.w , zambia " do n't you realise that this illegitimate government will never respect the people who refuse him to power ? "
gid , zimbabwe yes , it was a good move but do you know who is suffering and how ?
it is the mdc supporters , its leaders and anyone suspected to be mdc-affiliated .
zanu pf knows that it does no longer have any mandate to rule the country from the people .
it 's beating up and killing people-including the rural folks which have voted him to power .
is there a way of pressing for holding fresh elections ?
do n't you realise that this illegitimate government will never respect the people who refuse him to power ?
gid , zimbabwe all wrong by all means .
mugabe does not rule zimbabwe from common what ?
neither does he from britain nor usa .
the suspension is like a dog licking a bone .
address the land issue in a civilised way .
let 's prove that our democratic philosophy holds globally .
work on the core issues and success is our destiny by all routes .
sirengo , kenya a waste of time !
mugabe does n't care about the council as he knows very well that zimbabwe is still a commonwealth member .
council is just a tea and coffee club and mugabe can always make his own .
illusion created by media that suspension of zimbabwe from the council is a big deal is not helping opposition either .
now , they will be blamed for all the hardships .
p d nkwera , rsa " the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth is not just in any way " tropical lion the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth is not just in any way .
it only shows how the organisation is being dictated or inluenced by colonial ambitions and greed of former colonizer , the uk which still wants to impose its colonial empire of ideas and preaches propagandistic doctrines against any former colony that seems too independent in decision making .
so that is why the london mafias have been very busy in distorting the facts and misleading the whole world in issues regarding harare .
though suspended , zimbabwe or mugabe would not be deterred from land issue and any other things that are of great interest to the uk .
tropical lion i agree with many of the comments that have been made that this suspension , while a step in the right direction , will accomplish basically nothing .
mugabe is a dictator who promotes injustice and corruption , keeping his own skin intact by stirring up his peoples ' hatred against the " evil white imperialists . "
if it were n't for the millions of innocents it would hurt , it might be interesting to give these demagogues what they want and simply end all western involvement in their countries - no aid , no development help , no nothing .
i wonder how long their regimes would last then .
cody , usa " why has it taken the enlightened west so long to discover that mugabe was not the liberationist hero that britain had previously and for so long portrayed him as being ? "
john gs , australia the former golden-boy of the commonwealth , mugabe has presided over the country for nearly 22 years .
he has done so with the support of the entire zanu-pf party apparatus and more importantly , with valuable and abundant foreign aid from countries like britain , canada , australia , the united states .
why has it taken the enlightened west so long to discover that mugabe was not the liberationist hero that britain had previously and for so long portrayed him as being ?
the story does not add up .
tony blair 's spin-doctors and propagandists wo n't be able to cover up the reality of the economic and political situation in southern africa indefinitely .
john gs , australia when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers , bear this in mind .
lineo , lesotho given the way mugabe and zanu-pf behaved in the two years of their election campaign -lrb- deaths , torture , beatings , ' re-education ' camps -rrb- and now the brutal youth militia acted , it would have been criminal for the commonwealth to pretend that politics continues as normal in zimbabwe - so yes , it was right to suspend mugabe .
but what else ?
how can the people of zimbabwe be helped to overcome their political elite ?
ian love , zimbabwe better late than never .
james castro , usa finally some action against a tyrant and his cronies who are a disgrace to their country , to africa , to the world , and to the human race .
one day , they will be held accountable for the blood they have caused to be spilled , the dreadful damage they have caused to the innocents of their own country .
clarke slatter , usa " let us deal with our leaders ourselves " vicky k , zimbabwe no it was not the right thing .
mugabe may have wronged along the way but why are people not addressing what he is saying .
the land was grabbed from zimbabweans without any compensation .
it 's not a matter of mugabe or tsvangirai .
i know that even if we put tsvangirai in power he is also going to go through a lot of obstacles to get zimbabweans land .
if you come to zimbabwe we black people are still living in the western suburbs where fumes from industries blow and all the sewage flows .
in the rural areas we are living in rocky areas .
it easy for you guys in the west to call for sanctions because it is your weapon .
you have the financial might - you have the control .
everyone is talking about flaws .
what was flawed ?
you guys finance the wars in africa .
how can a small country like rwanda finance a war for 4 years ?
how does unita survive financially ?
i hope one day that when making your decisions you will not be racially minded .
yours is a global dictatorship .
let us deal with our leaders ourselves .
vicky k , zimbabwe the very least that the commonwealth should have done was to suspend zimbabwe .
this should have been done a long time ago , after the travesty of the previous general election .
i 've spent many years going back and forth to zimbabwe , my wife is a shona woman , and in the twelve years since i first went there , i 've seen the country go from a potential economic power house to the economic disaster it has become today .
as the former colonial rulers , the uk has a special responsibility to zimbabwe , and it 's a responsibility we 've been content to abrogate for far too long ; the result of which is that we , and the rest of the western nations will be forced through simple humanitarian demands , to support the people , while their government goes on stealing from everyone it can , while it continues to laugh up it 's sleeve at us as it goes about the daily task of oppressing the rights of its population and intimidating anyone who dares to stand in opposition .
r p , england definitely , not .
you should realise , this a third world country which is relatively poor in education and economy .
your harsh action will only affect the ordinary people and certainly not the leaders .
you should advise mugabe to do it better in future and rectify the weaknesses .
warn them of these weakness and against doing it in the future .
this action can be considered as a revenge as a result of mugabe 's policy towards white people .
i do not agree with his policy but suspension is not the answer .
be objective please .
wan ashri , malaysia that was long overdue .
zimbabwe should have been suspended from the commonwealth 20 years with mugabe 's treatment of the matebele people .
thanks commonwealth for acting but we still need more help .
never have the black and white zimbabweans united so much to deal with a rogue leader who plays the race card to remain in power .
the zimbabwean issue is not about land , race or re-colonisation it is about a leader who has plundered his people and is afraid of leaving power for fear of being made to account for his record .
the people have suffered and we are glad that the wimp-like mbeki and obasanjo are now acting against mugabe .
thank you commonwealth but where are you sadc and oau ?
s dube , zimbabwe only the misguided , blind and blinkered people do favour west interference in zimbabwe .
why notice a stick in mugabe 's eye when not seeing the logs in commonwealth and west 's eyes ?
how do you define a dictator ?
if mugabe is one , then the world is full of them , with the worst of dictators found in the west .
nicholas m. ngoma , zimbabwe i hope what has happened to zimbabwe is a signal to all commonwealth countries whose leaders think they can govern their countries with no regard for human dignity .
through this action the commonwealth has shown its determination to uphold democracy , the rule of law and human rights .
congratulations !
mart , cameroon / usa tell us please what zimbabwe will lose as a result of this decision ?
abdullah , malaysia " it uncovered the hypocrisy of the commonwealth as an institution " tope agboola , nigeria to question one : it 's a yes for a right suspension , because mugabe really oppressed his own people .
to question two : it will make one bad difference on the continent as it uncovered the hypocrisy of the commonwealth as an institution .
that is without regard to who are members of the tripartite committee that took the suspension decision or on what basis it was taken .
it was all along " right " not to worry if the oppressive mugabe and his officials kept huge dollar accounts in swiss , british or us banks .
suddenly we begin to hear what we did n't know , that mugabe and his officials even had foreign bank accounts and assets , far in excess of their official entitlements .
suddenly , it became " wrong " not to freeze this wealth which the west has long closed eyes to .
god bless the zimbabwe crisis for revealing a new philosophy : you can have both a friend and a foe in one personality .
could i point out that the so-called credibility of the commonwealth does not fly in the face of a cold feet concerning speaking in clear policy stance against commonwealth nations that keep the ill-gotten wealth of african despots .
i hope this is not a bitter pill for the commonwealth at this her glorious moment of triumph .
tope agboola , nigeria the implications on the southern african region are disastrous .
while mugabe swans around in luxury , his people are starving - they do n't have the strength to react as those in the western world would .
' power ' has gone to mugabe 's head and frankly if africa wants to remain third world , it 's heading the right way by backing this tyrant .
andrew , south africa " no , the commonwealth was not right to suspend zimbabwe , but it has no effect anyway at this point " samuel banks , usa no , the commonwealth was not right to suspend zimbabwe , but it has no effect anyway at this point .
why is it that whenever you have an african nation with a leader that is n't afraid to stand up to european domination and rules , everyone gets so terrified ?
right or wrong , african nations need to become independent and bond together without outside interference , because that 's all europeans ever do in these types of situations is interfere and manipulate who they want in power .
i 'd like to see all african countries free from european intervention , but then , if that were to come to fruition , africa would be the new world 's terrorist haven , not the middle east .
samuel banks , usa the action taken by the commonwealth will have very little impact .
hit mugabe where it will hurt him most , freeze all of his personal bank accounts and assets across europe and deposit these monies into a fund for the future re-investment of a new zimbabwe .
bairbre ni breatnach , republic of ireland i 've been in mozambique and zimbabwe .
suspension is not enough .
it 's a joke .
as noted by several , mugabe could care less .
it 's time the attempt to portray mr. mugabe as someone who is righting the injustices black africans experienced at the hands of european colonialist stop .
mugabe and his thugs are criminals .
his only interest is himself .
he is righting no wrongs .
he is causing many .
everyone is so afraid of appearing to favour white folks that no one is willing to call a crooked black man crooked .
i do n't care what colour mugabe is , he is a crook .
bad for zimbabwe and bad for africa .
eu sanctions , ha .
he is laughing all the way to the bank .
take steps to remove him otherwise its all a waste of time and a joke .
i can only imagine what the world 's out cry would be if a white majority government was killing black farmers and taking away black farmers farms and land !
jim middleton , america why all this fuss about zimbabwe , all the extreme propaganda etc ?
i have to agree mugabe must go but all the british are worried about is the 4000 white farmers who own 80 % of zimbabwe 's fertile land !
hundreds have died in africa , but they do n't make it to the headlines , but one farmer . it 's a newsflash !
teddy , uk " i can not say that there is absolute democracy in that country , but that they could at least vote is already great achievement for democracy " peter andersson , sweden i have been in zimbabwe two years ago .
i can not say that there is absolute democracy in that country , but that they could at least vote is already great achievement for democracy .
what is saddening is that they are not allowed to cultivate it and bring democracy to maturity by their own way .
the magnitude of the interference of the " west " in a sovereign county like zimbabwe is frightening .
not only for zimbabweans but even for us " westerners " .
for me it seems that we are determined to dictate in every nations internal affairs as long as it fits our interest .
this can cause a lot of damage to us in the long run .
the young people in africa are very much aware of our behaviour that you can no more play tricky games with their integrity .
all the old and new clubs of the " west " is only designed to dictate africans .
please lets leave them alone and they can make it by themselves .
peter andersson , sweden mugabe is arrogant , ruthless and cunning .
yes they were dead right to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth if only the aim is to show mugabe that he is now isolated .
it would have been different had the south african observer team told the truth about the election and openly condemned all the irregularities .
i wish they knew that by just supporting mugabe because he is an african brother they signed the death warrants for thousands of zimbabweans .
maybe they feel they would face the same when it is their turn to cheat in an election .
shame on them !
nhamu chanandareka , zimbabwe shame to mugabe , shame to the eu community , shame to the commonweath .
for the past 22 years mugabe could n't carry on the land reform because he was your puppet .
afflicting with you now , you speak about the rule of law and human rights .
let 's speak about human right concerning middle east and australia .
let 's speak about human right and democracy to the fmi .
let 's speak about human right , the rule of law and democracy to your other african puppets who are still dictators and you are still supporting them .
shame to all of you .
ngoran , brazil / cameroon " it seems to me to be a token ' slap on the wrist ' ! "
connie wessels , uk if , as has been mentioned many times on this page , the commonwealth is a largely ineffective and weak organisation , what good does it do to suspend zimbabwe from it ?
it seems to me to be a token ' slap on the wrist ' !
connie wessels , uk suspension from the commonwealth is of little consequence to mugabe .
that two african leaders were involved in this decision -lrb- albeit under duress -rrb- has more significance .
it was obvious from the outset that the future of southern africa , and the negard initiative , depended upon the outcome of the situation in zimbabwe .
the west has largely fallen for mugabe 's own propaganda , and emphasises the land question , and the black / white question .
most of mugabe 's actions were in pursuit of his wish to retain control of zanu-pf - many people within this party supported the idea of ousting mugabe before the general elections two years ago .
they were effectively silenced .
now , so too , have the majority of zimbabweans , both rural and urban .
mugabe must be removed by force - peacekeeping troops must be sent now - the alternative may be yet another protracted civil war .
matabele , zimbabwe richard nwankwo of nigeria writes in this column that he wants the commonwealth and eu to keep out of africa 's political processes .
great idea except , unfortunately , the africans wo n't let us !
every time there 's a food / medical / war crisis in africa , the ex-colonial powers are expected to bail in with food -lrb- ethiopia -rrb- , medical supplies and doctors -lrb- everywhere in africa -rrb- , and guns and soldiers -lrb- sierra leone - who , apparently , would like us to recolonise the place -rrb- - the money for all of which comes out of the nasty ex-colonials pockets !
doubtless , unless mugabe dies or is shot -lrb- hopefully the latter -rrb- , we will be called upon to do all the above yet again !
you ca n't have it both ways , mr nwankwo !
sue hudson , london , uk " sanctions was a step in the right direction " scott , south african in uk sanctions was a step in the right direction , the only thing that confuses me , is how come they can still enter the commonwealth games that is close by , and when the situation was reversed , south africa was banned from all games .
it seems the commonwealth make up their own rules as they go along .
scott , south african in uk i think people need to separate rhetoric from the facts .
suspending mugabe from the commonwealth is meaningless .
mugabe is a despot of little to no redeeming qualities .
zimbabwe 's problems , and those of africa as a whole , will not end with the removal of the mugabes of africa .
more dictators will follow in their paths .
do n't forget that these people have their deputies with much to lose from leaving power .
i do n't know where africa would be without colonisation , though i think that the assumption that it would be nowhere demonstrates the kind of arrogance that people like mugabe use to their benefit .
africa 's problems will eventually have to be solved by africans .
the idea of a few thousand people owning a third of a country 's land is repugnant , regardless of whether those people are white or black .
there are those that say that these white farmers are responsible for most of zimbabwe 's foreign exchange , and that is true .
but what do you expect when they own so much land ?
james , us no i do not think this will have any effect on what this country is experiencing .
it will only increase his hatred for the remaining whites and first world governments .
you need to realise how this man has such a hatred for non-africans in the true sense .
anonymous " does the commonwealth really think that it is going to affect mugabe ? "
martin leahy , zimbabwe -lrb- uk -rrb- suspending zimbabwe was the right thing to do .
but does the commonwealth really think that it is going to affect mugabe ?
if they do then they are as foolish as the people who voted for mugabe .
he does n't care about anything ; all he cares about is his skin .
sanctions are not going to stop his youths form killing people like terry ford , 53 , a farmer or like ernest gatsi , 34 , an mdc supporter .
these two are the most recent out of the hundreds that are dead .
how many more of our friends and family are we going to let him and his cronies murder and beat ?
martin leahy , zimbabwe -lrb- uk -rrb- there are so many dictators in commonwealth that mugabe looks like a saint .
mike aziz , vancouver , canada zimbabwe continues to be a lesson for all the free world .
legal plunder is still the order of the day and civil unrest is met with death or imprisonment .
i suggest the free world just take notes and watch while this whole situation self-destructs .
once this happens , then civilized people can attempt to reconstruct a society that enforces individual rights and property rights .
james gammon , usa " suspending is a right step but more needs to be done to help the people " taco , netherlands suspending is a right step but more needs to be done to help the people .
meanwhile mugabe is having his way , using his youth brigade and so-called vets to do the dirty work .
time to really interfere i would say !
or , do we wait till mugabe -lrb- again -rrb- has cleaned out his opponents like he did in matabeleland years ago .
taco , netherlands banning zimbabwe from the commonwealth means nothing to mugabe .
as long has he is one of the wealthiest dictators around , and his wife can shop at harrods , what does he care ?
i think the best move would be to put him in a cell in the hague .
i 'm sure he has a lot to talk to milosevic about .
andrew lees , uk the suspension of zimbabwe is just another arrogant move to meddle in african affairs .
ahmed mussa , sweden very amusing reading , all the comments about the terrible things the colonials did .
i would be fascinated to see where ex-colonies would be today had they not been colonised .
come on - how long are the mugabes of the world going to keep blaming the state of their countries on ' white imperialism ' ?
you 've had plenty of time to sort yourselves out but instead have almost without exception allowed corruption to drive your countries into the ground .
the colonials may have done some bad things , but you are not helping yourself or zimbabwe , mr mugabe .
matt , uk , ex kenya " i think the commonwealth took the right decision -lrb- about the only time it 's ever done anything useful ! -rrb-
" sue hudson , london , uk i think the commonwealth took the right decision -lrb- about the only time it 's ever done anything useful ! -rrb- .
pity no-one has suspended his overseas bank accounts ...
however , mugabe 's getting old , he 'll be in his 80s when the next elections come round , once rich zimbabwe will be poverty-stricken , its beautiful fertile lands barren because no-one will be left who knows how to farm them , its economic infrastructure will be non-existent because tourists wo n't visit and no-one will risk investing money in the country .
i guess it 's just a toss-up between whether old age or a bullet gets to mugabe first !
whatever happens , you can only keep a people oppressed , starving , and in poverty for so long .
hopefully the zimbabweans will rise up sooner rather than later , and zimbabwe can once again take its rightful place in the world .
sue hudson , london , uk mugabe should be sitting next to milosevic in the court at the hague being tried for mass murder .
les , scotland the decision to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth is welcomed and long overdue .
if the election was neither free nor fair , then the present government of mugabe should not be recognised at all .
the eu should withdraw all its ambassadors from country so should the us and all commonwealth partners as a legitimate sign protest .
mugabe needs to feel the pinch because at the moment the only thing that will make him see sense is death .
he wants to take the country down with him .
but because of the blatant and hypocritical double standards of the west when it comes to these critical issues , i do n't see anyone making such a bold move .
there should one rule , for all , not for some .
victor kaitell , uk " zimbabwe has been hurt more by the division between black and white than by mugabe " joseph chifamba , zimbabwe no .
zimbabwe has been hurt more by the division between black and white than by mugabe .
he is only speaking on behalf of the downtrodden oppressed zimbabweans , the peasants who agree that the land belongs to them and who are too poor to even contribute their views in this forum .
joseph chifamba , zimbabwe well congrats to presidents mbeki and obasanjo for taking this action .
it is a pity ; this was not done before the election .
now is the time to put mass pressure on the mugabe regime .
this will certainly work .
the international community , must isolate zimbabwe , until zanu pf has no choice but to call new elections .
the only way forward for zimbabwe is a complete change in government .
change is always difficult initially , but it will benefit zimbabwe fully .
south africa was isolated in such a way until the apartheid regime capitulated .
the people of zimbabwe need to be free .
the struggle is now against mugabe and his illegal government .
rouan , uk yes .
i think it was right to suspend zimbabwe because it shows just how fickle the presence of the commonwealth is .
it is a relic of colonialism and at a time like this with the " white " powers against mugabe and the african powers against or neutral because of fear of retribution in the form of withdrawn financial aid it just exposes what principles the commonwealth was built on .
kottey , uk i think the fact that the swiss banks have frozen mugabe 's offshore bank accounts will have more effect that the suspension from the common wealth .
gretl coudrille , uk " the next action should be banning robert mugabe , his immediate family members and government officials , from entering any commonwealth country " jacob babarinde , nigerian , in the uk the next action should be banning robert mugabe , his immediate family members and government officials , from entering any commonwealth country until he bows out of power .
alternatively , he could be given the latitude to form a government of unity with the opposition .
the law-abiding people of zimbabwe have had enough of this power hungry man who should not be allowed to impoverish the poor any further .
jacob babarinde , nigerian , in the uk absolutely !
president mugabe is a disgrace to forward looking africans .
of course opportunists would look at this is a different light !
john ekaju , kenya absolutely right !
african leaders who claim that the election in zimbabwe was free and fair only reveal how they themselves come to power through a similarly " free and fair " election .
a typical case of scratch my back - i will scratch yours .
dictators have no eyes to recognise true democracy .
alex lengeju , tanzania " we believe in the liberty of the individual under the law , in equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender , race , colour , creed or political belief , and in the individual 's inalienable right to participate by means of free and democratic political processes in framing the society in which he or she lives ; " - harare declaration , 20 october 1991 .
if mugabe ca n't follow the rules he should n't be in the club .
the commonwealth would be betraying its own principles if it suffered zimbabwe to remain a member .
steve sholl , uk the mugabe regime is determined to stay in power at all costs , so more action is required against them , the usa must step up its efforts to investigate zanupf for its links with the taleban and the al-qaeda and also be dealt with accordingly and that 's the only way that can move them .
obert , zimbabwe " suspension from the commonwealth is a victory for mugabe " charles , uk and usa suspension from the commonwealth is a victory for mugabe .
it further distances what he perceives as ' white colonial ' intervention from his playpen and lessens our ability to exert influence on the affairs of zimbabwe .
the suspension is morally right but is too late to be positive .
we did not tolerate such governments in kosovo , bosnia and afghanistan and actually resorted to military force to replace them .
we may now have shut out all other options for zimbabwe .
charles , uk and usa i have a feeling that the commonwealth suspension of zimbabwe for a token one year , lacks the will and the " teeth " necessary to bring about change within this country , especially when they get a pass to participate in the commonwealth games , and the australian cricket team agrees to tour zimbabwe .
what is incongruous is the call for urgent financial aid by the eu and commonwealth members to offset the destruction of the zimbabwe economy by the target of a commonwealth suspension !
this does not make any sense ?
roger james , usa the suspension is well come but more must be done to press for fresh elections monitored by un , eu , commonwealth and must come to zimbabwe six months before the elections .
mbeki must be tougher on mugabe otherwise he will be the next mugabe in sa .
courage zvimba , zimbabwe " i say forget the commonwealth , what do we gain being in it in the first place ? "
human , planet earth what exactly is going to come out of this ?
more suffering for the zimbabwean people and more nonsense from the old man .
more should be done !
the commonwealth does not mean jack to zimbabweans except a way to run from zimbabwe to the uk and canada without needing a visa .
what else does the commonwealth mean ?
it 's just a symbol of the british empire which should by now be buried and forgotten about .
what is austrialian pm doing to redress the injustice done to the aborigines when the empire was amassing its common wealth ?
suspending zimbabwe or not , it does not make any difference to mugabe , his followers and the common man in zimbabwe .
pity those white " zimbabweans are crying foul now when one of them is killed , how many people are being killed as whole should be the question , not how many whites ?
another symbol of common wealth , for who ?
for the whites of course .
i say forget the commonwealth , what do we gain being in it in the first place ?
human , planet earth suspending zimbabwe was the " easy " thing to do .
if the world leaders are really true to their intentions they should now start doing something practical to improve the lives of zimbabweans -lrb- how about arresting mr m the first time he comes to london to shop or seek medical treatment ? -rrb- .
nico , italy the suspension means nothing much except that britain will not interfere in our affairs directly .
we do n't wish to rejoin the club in the future mwana wevhu , zimbabwe this is the least that should be done .
targeted sanctions should be next mb , australia " the commonwealth suspension is overdue " jmadigane , canada the conduct of the election was a betrayal of the tenet of " one man one vote " that mr mugabe espoused .
the commonwealth suspension is overdue and welcome .
jmadigane , canada too little too late .
it is morally correct but will be completely ineffective .
valerie , usa the commonwealth 's done right .
unfortunately it has come a bit too late .
besides , mugabe does n't care and true to honesty it was merely a question of time because he knew this was coming .
i believe regional leaders could have done more than we 've seen , then this suspension would have been a lot meaningful .
coming at this time , to a lot of people , it 's merely symbolic if not totally without consequence .
potlapotla monagen , botswana finally .
this is not a case of white farmer vs. blacks .
this is a case of a leader knowing he is trouble and playing the race card on a minority group to divert attention from the fact his opponents are also black and his government is corrupt .
also sanctions work .
they freed south africa .
unfortunately many african leaders owe mugabe favours and are reluctant to say anything bad about him .
sidney skinner , barbados one hundred percent correct to suspend zimbabwe .
it 'll be treated with absolute contempt by mugabe but at least it 's a clear message of affirmation for those many zimbabweans who believe in civil liberty and rule of law and a message to those who do n't that their criminal actions are not acceptable .
the suspension alone is nowhere near strong enough but it 's the first glimmer of hope for zimbabwe since the elections .
john hingi , zimbabwean refugee - uk " what the commonwealth is doing now should have been done two years ago " dan , zimbabwe what the commonwealth is doing now should have been done two years ago and zimbabwe might have seen free and fair presidential and parliament elections .
i do n't think mugabe really cares as long as no one is talking about arresting him and putting him to trial the man will not listen to anything .
dan , zimbabwe i think more should be done to stop mr. mugabe , if it were white farmers attacking blacks there would be an uproar , racism needs stamping out just as swiftly when it 's black on white .
michael , england no though i do n't support robert mugabe .
i do not think it was right it is the zimbabweans who suffer in the long run .
sandy dsue , zimbabwe all the turmoil is concentrated in urban areas where the support for mdc and zanu-pf is tilted towards mdc maybe on a 60-40 split .
in rural areas , all the support is for the present ruling party .
i may not like it and the world may not like it but the zimbabwe rural majority like it .
since there is a one-man-one vote system in zimbabwe , it 's going to take a while for mdc to gain enough popularity .
the commonwealth should not dictate its wishes to the people of zimbabwe .
it is a sad day in london , uk when the commonwealth is trying to make their vote count more than the voice of the zimbabwe people .
jr , usa " all we are saying is we wo n't call this farce an election , and wo n't recognise its results " paul connor , canada i have little patience for those who claim this suspension is unwarranted " meddling " by rich white ex-imperialists .
they do n't know what meddling is .
all we are saying is we wo n't call this farce an election , and wo n't recognise its results .
zimbabwe 's government can do what it wishes from now on , but few others in the world will bother with them anymore .
how , exactly , does this constitute " interference " ?
hopefully we westerners will have the wit to welcome skilled zimbabweans who likewise abjure mugabe 's kleptocracy .
i just wonder why mugabe would willingly choose to have to watch his back for the rest of his career and life .
i 'll never understand why such " leaders " needlessly multiply enmities among their own people .
ironically , the very concepts of " president " " election " " liberation " and " nation-state " are western .
i do n't see these " anti-imperialists " plumping for " native " alternatives , probably because they 'd be less lucrative .
paul connor , canada suspending zimbabwe is not only the right thing to do but also the only thing to do , as far as the commonwealth is concerned .
i am pleased to see that presidents mbeki and obasanjo backed the suspension .
it is about time that african presidents start looking out for the african people and not the african dictators such as mugabe .
nsengimana nsengimana , usa how can people say the commonwealth is " a forum of africa 's colonial masters and still represents the interest of imperialism " when two of the three leaders making today 's decision were african ?
yes the commonwealth was right - i definitely think it 's about time a joint international statement of condemnation is made against mugabe 's dictatorship .
unfortunately i agree with others that it will probably have little impact on mugabe himself , and for the rest of zimbabwe i pray .
karen , uk " this is a wise move , as it will allow zimbabwe and it 's original black countrymen to establish nationhood outside the pretext of commonwealth " jee , india this is a wise move , as it will allow zimbabwe and it 's original black countrymen to establish nationhood outside the pretext of commonwealth and most importantly britain and australia .
it should now ask all the supporters and representatives of enemy countries of commonwealth to leave zimbabwe and establish true rhodesian sovereignty .
jee , india what a drop encouragement in a desert of desolation this suspension is !
well done you three .
i know two of you were dragged by your hair screaming to get to this decision but well done all the same .
mugabe should now realise he is a sad excuse for a leader .
if he is sane he will finally notice the only people who can rescue from his phantom fight with blair are zimbabweans .
look after us and may be we will let you go along with your delusions .
whatever happened to one man one vote s. lunga , zimbabwean in uk has any thought been given as to where the rulers of these african states would be if the colonialist had not gone there in the first place ?
mb , canada " the right thing has been done " william b clarke , uk the commonwealth represents freedom , democracy and civility - mugabe has breached this , and to tolerate it would be as good as condemning his behaviour .
the right thing has been done .
william b clarke , uk the commonwealth played straight into mugabe 's hands again .
free food , thrown out of a commonwealth he hates anyway , and most zimbabweans have never been told what democracy or the commonwealth really are to start with .
doug macrae , south africa the violence in zimbabwe is deplorable .
punitive action needs to be taken directed towards mugabe and his cronies with minimal suffering for innocent zimbabwean people .
for a change the west seems to be taking positive action in helping zimbabwe , this should be applauded .
i 'm worried , though , by the fact that the western media highlights the suffering of white people in zimbabwe more than that of blacks .
we hear of white farmers dying in headlines while the killing of blacks is in small print , if at all mentioned .
ndumi , uk hurray !
not sure that it will have any effect on mugabe , but at least the world is making a stand .
perhaps the beginning of the end for mugabe .
ah , zimbabwean in uk " it 's about time the international community did something useful " peter james , zimbabwe it 's about time the international community did something useful .
it 's taken a long long time .
if it had been a white person in power , and he was murdering innocent people the world would of acted very quickly .
it seems that everyone is a bit scared of mugabe .
peter james , zimbabwe the commonwealth 's commitment to democracy is now in no doubt , neither is sa 's , nigeria 's or australia 's .
so far so good .
next step would be for sa to do some vigorous arm-twisting to get rgm to retire as soon as possible .
only then , perhaps , could there be a government of national unity with even a ghost of a chance of doing some good .
bill , usa absolutely , they were so right to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth , this should have been done sooner though .
they also need to decide what next step they are going to take as this can not go on , white farmers -lrb- not that it matters what colour they are -rrb- being killed because they are on african land , these white farmers have been there for generations like our blacks , asians etc have been here for generations and the uk is their country as much as it is ours , we can not let this go on as it will spread into the other african countries .
it is a pity that we can not work together as all of our blood is the same colour it does not matter what colour skin we have michelle , united kingdom " it has sent a stern warning that the commonwealth means business when it claims that it promotes and upholds values of democracy " cyprian kambili , malawian in uk the commonwealth has been right in suspending zimbabwe for a year - the decision is akin to an indictment with a strong unless and until zimbabwe government complies with the commonwealth harare principles it will face isolation and international reproach .
it has also sent a stern warning that the commonwealth means business when it claims that it promotes and upholds values of democracy .
any other decision in the light of the election fiasco in zimbabwe would have been welcoming anarchy into the commonwealth .
it would also have seriously and perhaps irretrievably have undermined the position and even perhaps the existence of commonwealth in the 21st century .
cyprian kambili , malawian in uk are zimbabweans not entitled to the same protection from the commonwealth that was given to the people of fiji ?
is democracy only one colour or for all colours ?
folks please stop patronizing zimbabweans .
we are suffering under an illegal regime that stole our sovereignty .
our voice must be heard .
our candidate must rule .
mugabe must go and the appeasement of his regime that has allowed him to remain in power over the last two years must stop .
jeqe , zimbabwean in uk its a good idea to officially blackball mugabe 's government but will this mean we white farmers will be left to our own devices ?
i hope not .
not after the events from the past few weeks .
a zimbabwean , harare " so zimbabwe will not be invited to the games in manchester .
big deal " andy sithole , zimbabwean in exile the common what ?
so zimbabwe will not be invited to the games in manchester .
big deal .
other than bruising mugabe 's ego i think it will strengthen his misplaced resolve .
what does a country have to do to be suspended from the united nations ?
i think the zimbabwean authorities are treading on that fine line and that would be effective .
africa and the world do not be fooled .
this is not a matter of black and white nor is it of north or south but a desperate attempt by an aging , yet crafty politician , to cling to power under the guise of righting the wrongs of the past .
we await president tsvangirai to take his rightful place .
andy sithole , zimbabwean in exile this is a welcome development as it sends a clear message to those dictators in africa who were planning similar tactics in the near future .
democracy has won decisively .
towera mchiwuno , denmark i think the commonwealth did the right thing by suspending zimbabwe .
the problem is zimbabwe 's african neighbours do n't and wo n't help because of their natural borders .
they are reliant on zimbabwe .
herein lies the problem .
the fall in economic development par se in the sadc countries has no political clout and that is the real traveristy because it does n't just affect the people in zimbabwe it affects others in zambia and malawi to name a few countries .

zimbabwe has been suspended from the commonwealth for a year with immediate effect .
the decision was taken by the commonwealth " troika " which was mandated to review the presidential elections in zimbabwe .
leaders of australia , nigeria and south africa agreed with commonwealth observers that the campaign had been marred by violence and intimidation .
the poll was also criticized by the usa , the european union and the uk .
was the commonwealth right to suspend zimbabwe ?
what difference will this decision make ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction " i feel it 's very wrong to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth " barrats , india / uk i feel it 's very wrong to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth .
i think the very reason behind this is that president mugabe won the election which barred the chances of uk , usa and western european countries to set up a puppet government and get all their wishes done .
the winning of mugabe has given some chance to breath , struggle and strive for their own good barrats , india / uk i believe that all the people in the country will suffer .
the poor will suffer the most .
barbados the commonwealth is wasting its time .
mugabe has no intent of giving up power .
by hook or by crook , he will stay in power .
alan noma , canada like most other issues around the world , suspending zimbabwe does not solve the root cause of the matter - which is how can the real owners of the land in zimbabwe be given back their land oladimeji , nigeria the commonwealth is getting a little ahead of itself if it thinks suspension will achieve much - it 's a toothless organisation with no particular relevance , and certainly with very little resolve .
don mckinnon and his crowd could 've and should 've acted far more decisively in highlighting to the world the desperate state of zimbabwe before 2000 's general election .
it may have made a difference back then .
darren oldfield , uk " this is an incredible tragedy brought on by an old man desperately trying to keep himself in power " richard wisecarver , alaska i think that most of the news and commentary miss the point .
mugabe has damaged the country in several horrible ways .
he has laid the foundation for a long term civil war , and he has cut off all hope of real economic progress .
no one in his right mind would invest a dime in the country .
he has guaranteed that any successful investment would be ceased as a matter of course with the justification of racial revenge .
i can not picture sane investor from any part of the world , of any race throwing good money after bad .
there were many ways to put these contested lands back into the hands of the black majority .
this was the worst possible choice .
breaking commercial farms into subsistence farms is a guarantee of continuing poverty for those who take up those lands .
it takes away the homes and jobs of farm workers who live on the land already and it destroys a major source of export income that zimbabwe needs .
this is not to mention the food that they produce for the nation .
zimbabwe can not afford to import food that it should produce .
this is an incredible tragedy brought on by an old man desperately trying to keep himself in power at all costs .
i will predict that many thousands will die as a result of the impending civil war , economic chaos and the flight of world capital .
many third world countries struggle just to survive , while others like zimbabwe and palestine rush toward chaos and horror with eyes wide open .
richard wisecarver , wasilla , alaska the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth for mugabe 's hostilities , intimidation and elimination of civilian lives for his political survival is genuine and applauded .
even to impose economic sanction would n't be a bad idea to get mugabe to feel the pinch of his actions and draconian rule but it is only the ordinary citizens who will suffer the most .
dale , uk that was the most sensible thing for the commonwealth to do .
though too late .
it is surprising how some non zimbabweans glorify mugabe because of their rabid hatred for the west .
please fight your own wars with the colonialists and stop using zimbabweans .
the majority of the people who are being killed , maimed and displaced in zimbabwe are blacks and not white farmers .
the man does not like opposition and that is the reason for all our suffering .
i wish you could have a page for zimbabweans only and i tell you , you will be surprised what people will write .
lazarus , zimbabwe zimbabwe 's suspension from the commonwealth is too little too late .
the people of zimbabwe have suffered enough and for a long time under this despotic ruler .
suspension at this stage will hardly even scratch the surface in changing that .
as ordinary zimbabweans , we feel betrayed in a way , by the world and anyone who is in a position to help us out of this .
we want to be free .
the electoral process seemed to have failed us yet again because it can be rigged .
we have never known good governance .
could somebody out there please help !
vm , zimbabwe " why does the west feel that sanctions are the panacea in resolving the many problems in africa ? "
deckey boy , liberia why does the west feel that sanctions are the panacea in resolving the many problems in africa ?
sanctions have rather proven counterproductive as seen in libya , liberia , sudan etc .
they only the very people that are to be protected and drag the country into deeper destitution .
any sober-minded person can see that the sanctions imposed on zimbabwe are far from what transpired during the election .
great britain is only using this election issue as a stepping stone to get back at mugabe for his drastic land reform - all at the expense of poor zimbabweans .
my fellow africans when will we ever see the light ?
deckey boy , liberia i think zimbabwe should not have been suspended from the commonwealth , and the western world is interested in this matter only because of the white farmers in the country .
there have been many african elections like this one , but no western politician ever said anything about it .
and also , let 's look at george bush 's own election , as there are lots of questions to be asked about it .
smith , england " the west seems to care more for the white farmers , and possibly even their dogs , than it does about the rest of black africa " yanni mbandi , usa - cameroon the barbarism of dr mugabe 's followers appals me .
but a sense of justice constrains me from condemning it without also identifying its roots - britain 's own past treacheries .
the west seems to care more for the white farmers , and possibly even their dogs , than it does about the rest of black africa .
europeans and especially british are taking this election seriously because of the white farmers .
if britain is very serious about democracy in africa , it should be at the front at all times and not only in one special area .
there was little outcry when guinea held a referendum last year that paved the way for president lansana conte , a key western ally in the region , to rule for the duration of his life .
it is scandalous and hypocritical that there should be such obvious double standards , and we have to ask ourselves why that should be .
you will find answers in the reasons why africans were enslaved and colonized .
yanni mbandi , usa - cameroon the commonwealth was wrong to suspend zimbabwe because it means nothing at this stage .
the main difference now will be that the commonwealth as such lost the right to express any opinion or influence the situation in zimbabwe .
mugabe can not care less if he going to receive the offer of rejoining the club in a year or not .
this on the other hand , will give him even more space to continue his involvement in drc and sell out the country to libyan and other governments interested in territorial or mineral riches .
the only right solution in this situation is that mbeki and other sadc leaders wake up and realise that mugabe means trouble .
what do you do with a brother who hurts the family ?
you forgive him but you do n't let him hurt the family any more .
tsitsi , zim & uk the commonwealth has carried out it 's obligation to improve the human rights and democratic rights of the people of zimbabwe .
the rights of all zimbabweans are at stake here , not just a tribe , a race , a political party !
land issues are for the people of zimbabwe to decide democratically on , not to satisfy any other country .
alec , uk " we have to be happy because the colonial masters are realising that their time is up ! "
vusumzi mpongo , south africa the commonwealth suspends zimbabwe ...
so what ?
africans have to be happy about this .
we have to be happy because the colonial masters are realising that their time is up !
the commonwealth is a mechanism to monitor africans - a perpetuation of colonialism , and thus a tool for further oppression and suppression .
mugabe is giving africans a message : it is time we stood against oppression in all forms .
we must always refer to history .
it happened in the congo , and imperialism consumed lumumba .
puppets of imperialism entrapped , at their masters ' orders , and killed lumumba .
why ?
because he had vowed to stand firm against colonialism .
it is time for african renaissance , and that renaissance must start with africans seeking and getting their independence .
vusumzi mpongo , south africa mugabe and his cronies still have food on their tables while most of our relatives back home are starving .
it is about time some military or forceful means were used to rid the country of this tyrant , before he fools another strong opposition into forming a government of national unity !
charles bongani , uk yes sanctions were rightly imposed on zimbabwe , but its too little , too late .
they should have acted long ago , without giving the so-called hierarchy notice that it was going to happen .
those of you who have not seen what has come of zimbabwe in the last few years should not even have the nerve to air your arrogant remarks , without knowing the extent to which people are suffering , and the difficulties the average families have to survive .
economic , and regional ruin is what lies ahead if something is not done and done quick .
zanu pf made a mockery out of democracy .
i 'd rather the west interfere .
once proud zimbabwean , uk " mugabe 's behaviour towards his people has been far worse that the smith regime 's before him " mdy , an african in uk mugabe 's behaviour towards his people has been far worse that the smith regime 's before him .
he should be heavily sanctioned by all freedom loving people around the world for his treatment of the matebele , his own people , and his violation of the institution of democracy .
zimbabwe needs liberation .
mdy , an african in uk i strongly feel that the commonwealth should not have suspended zimbabwe .
this only will help worsen the already ailing and staggering economic situation in the country .
rather it should have taken particular measures against specific individuals which it claims are violating human rights .
my question is : who is a more serious human rights abuser , one who sponsors all these political clashes , wars and genocides or one who strives to get back what has been unlawfully taken away from him , that is the land itself in this case ?
let zimbabweans solve their domestic disputes alone .
n. mutoworera , zimbabwe excellent move , although i am positive it will not affect mugabe !
he wants the land for his ' people ' but what have they done with the land ?
they are incapable of thinking for themselves to farm grain and provide for their people .
independence was won in 1980 and yet the black man has not risen up and shown the world what he can do with the country .
c alexander , south african " i never knew that the commonwealth still existed ! "
anock banda , proud african i never knew that the commonwealth still existed !
well pretty much leaves blair thinking he had the last laugh .
other than that you ca n't do anything about adding sanctions , and if you do then it just states that the west cares less about unimportant countries , for example zambia .
anock banda , proud african i do not care what sanctions the west imposes on us , as long as we can get back our land , have somewhere to live on and grow our own food .
soon the west will be a laughing stock for africa .
luke , zimbabwe i really do n't know what the international community gains from sanctions against the so-called dictators .
the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth would not yield a better life for zimbabweans , but it will bring about great suffering and bitterness among politicians .
i do n't support unnecessary interference of the west into african politics .
however , the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth should be a lesson to many african politicians , that if they think african politics should be left to africans , they should learn to protect and respect the rights of all citizens in the respective countries .
mwape.w , zambia " do n't you realise that this illegitimate government will never respect the people who refuse him to power ? "
gid , zimbabwe yes , it was a good move but do you know who is suffering and how ?
it is the mdc supporters , its leaders and anyone suspected to be mdc-affiliated .
zanu pf knows that it does no longer have any mandate to rule the country from the people .
it 's beating up and killing people-including the rural folks which have voted him to power .
is there a way of pressing for holding fresh elections ?
do n't you realise that this illegitimate government will never respect the people who refuse him to power ?
gid , zimbabwe all wrong by all means .
mugabe does not rule zimbabwe from common what ?
neither does he from britain nor usa .
the suspension is like a dog licking a bone .
address the land issue in a civilised way .
let 's prove that our democratic philosophy holds globally .
work on the core issues and success is our destiny by all routes .
sirengo , kenya a waste of time !
mugabe does n't care about the council as he knows very well that zimbabwe is still a commonwealth member .
council is just a tea and coffee club and mugabe can always make his own .
illusion created by media that suspension of zimbabwe from the council is a big deal is not helping opposition either .
now , they will be blamed for all the hardships .
p d nkwera , rsa " the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth is not just in any way " tropical lion the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth is not just in any way .
it only shows how the organisation is being dictated or inluenced by colonial ambitions and greed of former colonizer , the uk which still wants to impose its colonial empire of ideas and preaches propagandistic doctrines against any former colony that seems too independent in decision making .
so that is why the london mafias have been very busy in distorting the facts and misleading the whole world in issues regarding harare .
though suspended , zimbabwe or mugabe would not be deterred from land issue and any other things that are of great interest to the uk .
tropical lion i agree with many of the comments that have been made that this suspension , while a step in the right direction , will accomplish basically nothing .
mugabe is a dictator who promotes injustice and corruption , keeping his own skin intact by stirring up his peoples ' hatred against the " evil white imperialists . "
if it were n't for the millions of innocents it would hurt , it might be interesting to give these demagogues what they want and simply end all western involvement in their countries - no aid , no development help , no nothing .
i wonder how long their regimes would last then .
cody , usa " why has it taken the enlightened west so long to discover that mugabe was not the liberationist hero that britain had previously and for so long portrayed him as being ? "
john gs , australia the former golden-boy of the commonwealth , mugabe has presided over the country for nearly 22 years .
he has done so with the support of the entire zanu-pf party apparatus and more importantly , with valuable and abundant foreign aid from countries like britain , canada , australia , the united states .
why has it taken the enlightened west so long to discover that mugabe was not the liberationist hero that britain had previously and for so long portrayed him as being ?
the story does not add up .
tony blair 's spin-doctors and propagandists wo n't be able to cover up the reality of the economic and political situation in southern africa indefinitely .
john gs , australia when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers , bear this in mind .
lineo , lesotho given the way mugabe and zanu-pf behaved in the two years of their election campaign -lrb- deaths , torture , beatings , ' re-education ' camps -rrb- and now the brutal youth militia acted , it would have been criminal for the commonwealth to pretend that politics continues as normal in zimbabwe - so yes , it was right to suspend mugabe .
but what else ?
how can the people of zimbabwe be helped to overcome their political elite ?
ian love , zimbabwe better late than never .
james castro , usa finally some action against a tyrant and his cronies who are a disgrace to their country , to africa , to the world , and to the human race .
one day , they will be held accountable for the blood they have caused to be spilled , the dreadful damage they have caused to the innocents of their own country .
clarke slatter , usa " let us deal with our leaders ourselves " vicky k , zimbabwe no it was not the right thing .
mugabe may have wronged along the way but why are people not addressing what he is saying .
the land was grabbed from zimbabweans without any compensation .
it 's not a matter of mugabe or tsvangirai .
i know that even if we put tsvangirai in power he is also going to go through a lot of obstacles to get zimbabweans land .
if you come to zimbabwe we black people are still living in the western suburbs where fumes from industries blow and all the sewage flows .
in the rural areas we are living in rocky areas .
it easy for you guys in the west to call for sanctions because it is your weapon .
you have the financial might - you have the control .
everyone is talking about flaws .
what was flawed ?
you guys finance the wars in africa .
how can a small country like rwanda finance a war for 4 years ?
how does unita survive financially ?
i hope one day that when making your decisions you will not be racially minded .
yours is a global dictatorship .
let us deal with our leaders ourselves .
vicky k , zimbabwe the very least that the commonwealth should have done was to suspend zimbabwe .
this should have been done a long time ago , after the travesty of the previous general election .
i 've spent many years going back and forth to zimbabwe , my wife is a shona woman , and in the twelve years since i first went there , i 've seen the country go from a potential economic power house to the economic disaster it has become today .
as the former colonial rulers , the uk has a special responsibility to zimbabwe , and it 's a responsibility we 've been content to abrogate for far too long ; the result of which is that we , and the rest of the western nations will be forced through simple humanitarian demands , to support the people , while their government goes on stealing from everyone it can , while it continues to laugh up it 's sleeve at us as it goes about the daily task of oppressing the rights of its population and intimidating anyone who dares to stand in opposition .
r p , england definitely , not .
you should realise , this a third world country which is relatively poor in education and economy .
your harsh action will only affect the ordinary people and certainly not the leaders .
you should advise mugabe to do it better in future and rectify the weaknesses .
warn them of these weakness and against doing it in the future .
this action can be considered as a revenge as a result of mugabe 's policy towards white people .
i do not agree with his policy but suspension is not the answer .
be objective please .
wan ashri , malaysia that was long overdue .
zimbabwe should have been suspended from the commonwealth 20 years with mugabe 's treatment of the matebele people .
thanks commonwealth for acting but we still need more help .
never have the black and white zimbabweans united so much to deal with a rogue leader who plays the race card to remain in power .
the zimbabwean issue is not about land , race or re-colonisation it is about a leader who has plundered his people and is afraid of leaving power for fear of being made to account for his record .
the people have suffered and we are glad that the wimp-like mbeki and obasanjo are now acting against mugabe .
thank you commonwealth but where are you sadc and oau ?
s dube , zimbabwe only the misguided , blind and blinkered people do favour west interference in zimbabwe .
why notice a stick in mugabe 's eye when not seeing the logs in commonwealth and west 's eyes ?
how do you define a dictator ?
if mugabe is one , then the world is full of them , with the worst of dictators found in the west .
nicholas m. ngoma , zimbabwe i hope what has happened to zimbabwe is a signal to all commonwealth countries whose leaders think they can govern their countries with no regard for human dignity .
through this action the commonwealth has shown its determination to uphold democracy , the rule of law and human rights .
congratulations !
mart , cameroon / usa tell us please what zimbabwe will lose as a result of this decision ?
abdullah , malaysia " it uncovered the hypocrisy of the commonwealth as an institution " tope agboola , nigeria to question one : it 's a yes for a right suspension , because mugabe really oppressed his own people .
to question two : it will make one bad difference on the continent as it uncovered the hypocrisy of the commonwealth as an institution .
that is without regard to who are members of the tripartite committee that took the suspension decision or on what basis it was taken .
it was all along " right " not to worry if the oppressive mugabe and his officials kept huge dollar accounts in swiss , british or us banks .
suddenly we begin to hear what we did n't know , that mugabe and his officials even had foreign bank accounts and assets , far in excess of their official entitlements .
suddenly , it became " wrong " not to freeze this wealth which the west has long closed eyes to .
god bless the zimbabwe crisis for revealing a new philosophy : you can have both a friend and a foe in one personality .
could i point out that the so-called credibility of the commonwealth does not fly in the face of a cold feet concerning speaking in clear policy stance against commonwealth nations that keep the ill-gotten wealth of african despots .
i hope this is not a bitter pill for the commonwealth at this her glorious moment of triumph .
tope agboola , nigeria the implications on the southern african region are disastrous .
while mugabe swans around in luxury , his people are starving - they do n't have the strength to react as those in the western world would .
' power ' has gone to mugabe 's head and frankly if africa wants to remain third world , it 's heading the right way by backing this tyrant .
andrew , south africa " no , the commonwealth was not right to suspend zimbabwe , but it has no effect anyway at this point " samuel banks , usa no , the commonwealth was not right to suspend zimbabwe , but it has no effect anyway at this point .
why is it that whenever you have an african nation with a leader that is n't afraid to stand up to european domination and rules , everyone gets so terrified ?
right or wrong , african nations need to become independent and bond together without outside interference , because that 's all europeans ever do in these types of situations is interfere and manipulate who they want in power .
i 'd like to see all african countries free from european intervention , but then , if that were to come to fruition , africa would be the new world 's terrorist haven , not the middle east .
samuel banks , usa the action taken by the commonwealth will have very little impact .
hit mugabe where it will hurt him most , freeze all of his personal bank accounts and assets across europe and deposit these monies into a fund for the future re-investment of a new zimbabwe .
bairbre ni breatnach , republic of ireland i 've been in mozambique and zimbabwe .
suspension is not enough .
it 's a joke .
as noted by several , mugabe could care less .
it 's time the attempt to portray mr. mugabe as someone who is righting the injustices black africans experienced at the hands of european colonialist stop .
mugabe and his thugs are criminals .
his only interest is himself .
he is righting no wrongs .
he is causing many .
everyone is so afraid of appearing to favour white folks that no one is willing to call a crooked black man crooked .
i do n't care what colour mugabe is , he is a crook .
bad for zimbabwe and bad for africa .
eu sanctions , ha .
he is laughing all the way to the bank .
take steps to remove him otherwise its all a waste of time and a joke .
i can only imagine what the world 's out cry would be if a white majority government was killing black farmers and taking away black farmers farms and land !
jim middleton , america why all this fuss about zimbabwe , all the extreme propaganda etc ?
i have to agree mugabe must go but all the british are worried about is the 4000 white farmers who own 80 % of zimbabwe 's fertile land !
hundreds have died in africa , but they do n't make it to the headlines , but one farmer . it 's a newsflash !
teddy , uk " i can not say that there is absolute democracy in that country , but that they could at least vote is already great achievement for democracy " peter andersson , sweden i have been in zimbabwe two years ago .
i can not say that there is absolute democracy in that country , but that they could at least vote is already great achievement for democracy .
what is saddening is that they are not allowed to cultivate it and bring democracy to maturity by their own way .
the magnitude of the interference of the " west " in a sovereign county like zimbabwe is frightening .
not only for zimbabweans but even for us " westerners " .
for me it seems that we are determined to dictate in every nations internal affairs as long as it fits our interest .
this can cause a lot of damage to us in the long run .
the young people in africa are very much aware of our behaviour that you can no more play tricky games with their integrity .
all the old and new clubs of the " west " is only designed to dictate africans .
please lets leave them alone and they can make it by themselves .
peter andersson , sweden mugabe is arrogant , ruthless and cunning .
yes they were dead right to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth if only the aim is to show mugabe that he is now isolated .
it would have been different had the south african observer team told the truth about the election and openly condemned all the irregularities .
i wish they knew that by just supporting mugabe because he is an african brother they signed the death warrants for thousands of zimbabweans .
maybe they feel they would face the same when it is their turn to cheat in an election .
shame on them !
nhamu chanandareka , zimbabwe shame to mugabe , shame to the eu community , shame to the commonweath .
for the past 22 years mugabe could n't carry on the land reform because he was your puppet .
afflicting with you now , you speak about the rule of law and human rights .
let 's speak about human right concerning middle east and australia .
let 's speak about human right and democracy to the fmi .
let 's speak about human right , the rule of law and democracy to your other african puppets who are still dictators and you are still supporting them .
shame to all of you .
ngoran , brazil / cameroon " it seems to me to be a token ' slap on the wrist ' ! "
connie wessels , uk if , as has been mentioned many times on this page , the commonwealth is a largely ineffective and weak organisation , what good does it do to suspend zimbabwe from it ?
it seems to me to be a token ' slap on the wrist ' !
connie wessels , uk suspension from the commonwealth is of little consequence to mugabe .
that two african leaders were involved in this decision -lrb- albeit under duress -rrb- has more significance .
it was obvious from the outset that the future of southern africa , and the negard initiative , depended upon the outcome of the situation in zimbabwe .
the west has largely fallen for mugabe 's own propaganda , and emphasises the land question , and the black / white question .
most of mugabe 's actions were in pursuit of his wish to retain control of zanu-pf - many people within this party supported the idea of ousting mugabe before the general elections two years ago .
they were effectively silenced .
now , so too , have the majority of zimbabweans , both rural and urban .
mugabe must be removed by force - peacekeeping troops must be sent now - the alternative may be yet another protracted civil war .
matabele , zimbabwe richard nwankwo of nigeria writes in this column that he wants the commonwealth and eu to keep out of africa 's political processes .
great idea except , unfortunately , the africans wo n't let us !
every time there 's a food / medical / war crisis in africa , the ex-colonial powers are expected to bail in with food -lrb- ethiopia -rrb- , medical supplies and doctors -lrb- everywhere in africa -rrb- , and guns and soldiers -lrb- sierra leone - who , apparently , would like us to recolonise the place -rrb- - the money for all of which comes out of the nasty ex-colonials pockets !
doubtless , unless mugabe dies or is shot -lrb- hopefully the latter -rrb- , we will be called upon to do all the above yet again !
you ca n't have it both ways , mr nwankwo !
sue hudson , london , uk " sanctions was a step in the right direction " scott , south african in uk sanctions was a step in the right direction , the only thing that confuses me , is how come they can still enter the commonwealth games that is close by , and when the situation was reversed , south africa was banned from all games .
it seems the commonwealth make up their own rules as they go along .
scott , south african in uk i think people need to separate rhetoric from the facts .
suspending mugabe from the commonwealth is meaningless .
mugabe is a despot of little to no redeeming qualities .
zimbabwe 's problems , and those of africa as a whole , will not end with the removal of the mugabes of africa .
more dictators will follow in their paths .
do n't forget that these people have their deputies with much to lose from leaving power .
i do n't know where africa would be without colonisation , though i think that the assumption that it would be nowhere demonstrates the kind of arrogance that people like mugabe use to their benefit .
africa 's problems will eventually have to be solved by africans .
the idea of a few thousand people owning a third of a country 's land is repugnant , regardless of whether those people are white or black .
there are those that say that these white farmers are responsible for most of zimbabwe 's foreign exchange , and that is true .
but what do you expect when they own so much land ?
james , us no i do not think this will have any effect on what this country is experiencing .
it will only increase his hatred for the remaining whites and first world governments .
you need to realise how this man has such a hatred for non-africans in the true sense .
anonymous " does the commonwealth really think that it is going to affect mugabe ? "
martin leahy , zimbabwe -lrb- uk -rrb- suspending zimbabwe was the right thing to do .
but does the commonwealth really think that it is going to affect mugabe ?
if they do then they are as foolish as the people who voted for mugabe .
he does n't care about anything ; all he cares about is his skin .
sanctions are not going to stop his youths form killing people like terry ford , 53 , a farmer or like ernest gatsi , 34 , an mdc supporter .
these two are the most recent out of the hundreds that are dead .
how many more of our friends and family are we going to let him and his cronies murder and beat ?
martin leahy , zimbabwe -lrb- uk -rrb- there are so many dictators in commonwealth that mugabe looks like a saint .
mike aziz , vancouver , canada zimbabwe continues to be a lesson for all the free world .
legal plunder is still the order of the day and civil unrest is met with death or imprisonment .
i suggest the free world just take notes and watch while this whole situation self-destructs .
once this happens , then civilized people can attempt to reconstruct a society that enforces individual rights and property rights .
james gammon , usa " suspending is a right step but more needs to be done to help the people " taco , netherlands suspending is a right step but more needs to be done to help the people .
meanwhile mugabe is having his way , using his youth brigade and so-called vets to do the dirty work .
time to really interfere i would say !
or , do we wait till mugabe -lrb- again -rrb- has cleaned out his opponents like he did in matabeleland years ago .
taco , netherlands banning zimbabwe from the commonwealth means nothing to mugabe .
as long has he is one of the wealthiest dictators around , and his wife can shop at harrods , what does he care ?
i think the best move would be to put him in a cell in the hague .
i 'm sure he has a lot to talk to milosevic about .
andrew lees , uk the suspension of zimbabwe is just another arrogant move to meddle in african affairs .
ahmed mussa , sweden very amusing reading , all the comments about the terrible things the colonials did .
i would be fascinated to see where ex-colonies would be today had they not been colonised .
come on - how long are the mugabes of the world going to keep blaming the state of their countries on ' white imperialism ' ?
you 've had plenty of time to sort yourselves out but instead have almost without exception allowed corruption to drive your countries into the ground .
the colonials may have done some bad things , but you are not helping yourself or zimbabwe , mr mugabe .
matt , uk , ex kenya " i think the commonwealth took the right decision -lrb- about the only time it 's ever done anything useful ! -rrb-
" sue hudson , london , uk i think the commonwealth took the right decision -lrb- about the only time it 's ever done anything useful ! -rrb- .
pity no-one has suspended his overseas bank accounts ...
however , mugabe 's getting old , he 'll be in his 80s when the next elections come round , once rich zimbabwe will be poverty-stricken , its beautiful fertile lands barren because no-one will be left who knows how to farm them , its economic infrastructure will be non-existent because tourists wo n't visit and no-one will risk investing money in the country .
i guess it 's just a toss-up between whether old age or a bullet gets to mugabe first !
whatever happens , you can only keep a people oppressed , starving , and in poverty for so long .
hopefully the zimbabweans will rise up sooner rather than later , and zimbabwe can once again take its rightful place in the world .
sue hudson , london , uk mugabe should be sitting next to milosevic in the court at the hague being tried for mass murder .
les , scotland the decision to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth is welcomed and long overdue .
if the election was neither free nor fair , then the present government of mugabe should not be recognised at all .
the eu should withdraw all its ambassadors from country so should the us and all commonwealth partners as a legitimate sign protest .
mugabe needs to feel the pinch because at the moment the only thing that will make him see sense is death .
he wants to take the country down with him .
but because of the blatant and hypocritical double standards of the west when it comes to these critical issues , i do n't see anyone making such a bold move .
there should one rule , for all , not for some .
victor kaitell , uk " zimbabwe has been hurt more by the division between black and white than by mugabe " joseph chifamba , zimbabwe no .
zimbabwe has been hurt more by the division between black and white than by mugabe .
he is only speaking on behalf of the downtrodden oppressed zimbabweans , the peasants who agree that the land belongs to them and who are too poor to even contribute their views in this forum .
joseph chifamba , zimbabwe well congrats to presidents mbeki and obasanjo for taking this action .
it is a pity ; this was not done before the election .
now is the time to put mass pressure on the mugabe regime .
this will certainly work .
the international community , must isolate zimbabwe , until zanu pf has no choice but to call new elections .
the only way forward for zimbabwe is a complete change in government .
change is always difficult initially , but it will benefit zimbabwe fully .
south africa was isolated in such a way until the apartheid regime capitulated .
the people of zimbabwe need to be free .
the struggle is now against mugabe and his illegal government .
rouan , uk yes .
i think it was right to suspend zimbabwe because it shows just how fickle the presence of the commonwealth is .
it is a relic of colonialism and at a time like this with the " white " powers against mugabe and the african powers against or neutral because of fear of retribution in the form of withdrawn financial aid it just exposes what principles the commonwealth was built on .
kottey , uk i think the fact that the swiss banks have frozen mugabe 's offshore bank accounts will have more effect that the suspension from the common wealth .
gretl coudrille , uk " the next action should be banning robert mugabe , his immediate family members and government officials , from entering any commonwealth country " jacob babarinde , nigerian , in the uk the next action should be banning robert mugabe , his immediate family members and government officials , from entering any commonwealth country until he bows out of power .
alternatively , he could be given the latitude to form a government of unity with the opposition .
the law-abiding people of zimbabwe have had enough of this power hungry man who should not be allowed to impoverish the poor any further .
jacob babarinde , nigerian , in the uk absolutely !
president mugabe is a disgrace to forward looking africans .
of course opportunists would look at this is a different light !
john ekaju , kenya absolutely right !
african leaders who claim that the election in zimbabwe was free and fair only reveal how they themselves come to power through a similarly " free and fair " election .
a typical case of scratch my back - i will scratch yours .
dictators have no eyes to recognise true democracy .
alex lengeju , tanzania " we believe in the liberty of the individual under the law , in equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender , race , colour , creed or political belief , and in the individual 's inalienable right to participate by means of free and democratic political processes in framing the society in which he or she lives ; " - harare declaration , 20 october 1991 .
if mugabe ca n't follow the rules he should n't be in the club .
the commonwealth would be betraying its own principles if it suffered zimbabwe to remain a member .
steve sholl , uk the mugabe regime is determined to stay in power at all costs , so more action is required against them , the usa must step up its efforts to investigate zanupf for its links with the taleban and the al-qaeda and also be dealt with accordingly and that 's the only way that can move them .
obert , zimbabwe " suspension from the commonwealth is a victory for mugabe " charles , uk and usa suspension from the commonwealth is a victory for mugabe .
it further distances what he perceives as ' white colonial ' intervention from his playpen and lessens our ability to exert influence on the affairs of zimbabwe .
the suspension is morally right but is too late to be positive .
we did not tolerate such governments in kosovo , bosnia and afghanistan and actually resorted to military force to replace them .
we may now have shut out all other options for zimbabwe .
charles , uk and usa i have a feeling that the commonwealth suspension of zimbabwe for a token one year , lacks the will and the " teeth " necessary to bring about change within this country , especially when they get a pass to participate in the commonwealth games , and the australian cricket team agrees to tour zimbabwe .
what is incongruous is the call for urgent financial aid by the eu and commonwealth members to offset the destruction of the zimbabwe economy by the target of a commonwealth suspension !
this does not make any sense ?
roger james , usa the suspension is well come but more must be done to press for fresh elections monitored by un , eu , commonwealth and must come to zimbabwe six months before the elections .
mbeki must be tougher on mugabe otherwise he will be the next mugabe in sa .
courage zvimba , zimbabwe " i say forget the commonwealth , what do we gain being in it in the first place ? "
human , planet earth what exactly is going to come out of this ?
more suffering for the zimbabwean people and more nonsense from the old man .
more should be done !
the commonwealth does not mean jack to zimbabweans except a way to run from zimbabwe to the uk and canada without needing a visa .
what else does the commonwealth mean ?
it 's just a symbol of the british empire which should by now be buried and forgotten about .
what is austrialian pm doing to redress the injustice done to the aborigines when the empire was amassing its common wealth ?
suspending zimbabwe or not , it does not make any difference to mugabe , his followers and the common man in zimbabwe .
pity those white " zimbabweans are crying foul now when one of them is killed , how many people are being killed as whole should be the question , not how many whites ?
another symbol of common wealth , for who ?
for the whites of course .
i say forget the commonwealth , what do we gain being in it in the first place ?
human , planet earth suspending zimbabwe was the " easy " thing to do .
if the world leaders are really true to their intentions they should now start doing something practical to improve the lives of zimbabweans -lrb- how about arresting mr m the first time he comes to london to shop or seek medical treatment ? -rrb- .
nico , italy the suspension means nothing much except that britain will not interfere in our affairs directly .
we do n't wish to rejoin the club in the future mwana wevhu , zimbabwe this is the least that should be done .
targeted sanctions should be next mb , australia " the commonwealth suspension is overdue " jmadigane , canada the conduct of the election was a betrayal of the tenet of " one man one vote " that mr mugabe espoused .
the commonwealth suspension is overdue and welcome .
jmadigane , canada too little too late .
it is morally correct but will be completely ineffective .
valerie , usa the commonwealth 's done right .
unfortunately it has come a bit too late .
besides , mugabe does n't care and true to honesty it was merely a question of time because he knew this was coming .
i believe regional leaders could have done more than we 've seen , then this suspension would have been a lot meaningful .
coming at this time , to a lot of people , it 's merely symbolic if not totally without consequence .
potlapotla monagen , botswana finally .
this is not a case of white farmer vs. blacks .
this is a case of a leader knowing he is trouble and playing the race card on a minority group to divert attention from the fact his opponents are also black and his government is corrupt .
also sanctions work .
they freed south africa .
unfortunately many african leaders owe mugabe favours and are reluctant to say anything bad about him .
sidney skinner , barbados one hundred percent correct to suspend zimbabwe .
it 'll be treated with absolute contempt by mugabe but at least it 's a clear message of affirmation for those many zimbabweans who believe in civil liberty and rule of law and a message to those who do n't that their criminal actions are not acceptable .
the suspension alone is nowhere near strong enough but it 's the first glimmer of hope for zimbabwe since the elections .
john hingi , zimbabwean refugee - uk " what the commonwealth is doing now should have been done two years ago " dan , zimbabwe what the commonwealth is doing now should have been done two years ago and zimbabwe might have seen free and fair presidential and parliament elections .
i do n't think mugabe really cares as long as no one is talking about arresting him and putting him to trial the man will not listen to anything .
dan , zimbabwe i think more should be done to stop mr. mugabe , if it were white farmers attacking blacks there would be an uproar , racism needs stamping out just as swiftly when it 's black on white .
michael , england no though i do n't support robert mugabe .
i do not think it was right it is the zimbabweans who suffer in the long run .
sandy dsue , zimbabwe all the turmoil is concentrated in urban areas where the support for mdc and zanu-pf is tilted towards mdc maybe on a 60-40 split .
in rural areas , all the support is for the present ruling party .
i may not like it and the world may not like it but the zimbabwe rural majority like it .
since there is a one-man-one vote system in zimbabwe , it 's going to take a while for mdc to gain enough popularity .
the commonwealth should not dictate its wishes to the people of zimbabwe .
it is a sad day in london , uk when the commonwealth is trying to make their vote count more than the voice of the zimbabwe people .
jr , usa " all we are saying is we wo n't call this farce an election , and wo n't recognise its results " paul connor , canada i have little patience for those who claim this suspension is unwarranted " meddling " by rich white ex-imperialists .
they do n't know what meddling is .
all we are saying is we wo n't call this farce an election , and wo n't recognise its results .
zimbabwe 's government can do what it wishes from now on , but few others in the world will bother with them anymore .
how , exactly , does this constitute " interference " ?
hopefully we westerners will have the wit to welcome skilled zimbabweans who likewise abjure mugabe 's kleptocracy .
i just wonder why mugabe would willingly choose to have to watch his back for the rest of his career and life .
i 'll never understand why such " leaders " needlessly multiply enmities among their own people .
ironically , the very concepts of " president " " election " " liberation " and " nation-state " are western .
i do n't see these " anti-imperialists " plumping for " native " alternatives , probably because they 'd be less lucrative .
paul connor , canada suspending zimbabwe is not only the right thing to do but also the only thing to do , as far as the commonwealth is concerned .
i am pleased to see that presidents mbeki and obasanjo backed the suspension .
it is about time that african presidents start looking out for the african people and not the african dictators such as mugabe .
nsengimana nsengimana , usa how can people say the commonwealth is " a forum of africa 's colonial masters and still represents the interest of imperialism " when two of the three leaders making today 's decision were african ?
yes the commonwealth was right - i definitely think it 's about time a joint international statement of condemnation is made against mugabe 's dictatorship .
unfortunately i agree with others that it will probably have little impact on mugabe himself , and for the rest of zimbabwe i pray .
karen , uk " this is a wise move , as it will allow zimbabwe and it 's original black countrymen to establish nationhood outside the pretext of commonwealth " jee , india this is a wise move , as it will allow zimbabwe and it 's original black countrymen to establish nationhood outside the pretext of commonwealth and most importantly britain and australia .
it should now ask all the supporters and representatives of enemy countries of commonwealth to leave zimbabwe and establish true rhodesian sovereignty .
jee , india what a drop encouragement in a desert of desolation this suspension is !
well done you three .
i know two of you were dragged by your hair screaming to get to this decision but well done all the same .
mugabe should now realise he is a sad excuse for a leader .
if he is sane he will finally notice the only people who can rescue from his phantom fight with blair are zimbabweans .
look after us and may be we will let you go along with your delusions .
whatever happened to one man one vote s. lunga , zimbabwean in uk has any thought been given as to where the rulers of these african states would be if the colonialist had not gone there in the first place ?
mb , canada " the right thing has been done " william b clarke , uk the commonwealth represents freedom , democracy and civility - mugabe has breached this , and to tolerate it would be as good as condemning his behaviour .
the right thing has been done .
william b clarke , uk the commonwealth played straight into mugabe 's hands again .
free food , thrown out of a commonwealth he hates anyway , and most zimbabweans have never been told what democracy or the commonwealth really are to start with .
doug macrae , south africa the violence in zimbabwe is deplorable .
punitive action needs to be taken directed towards mugabe and his cronies with minimal suffering for innocent zimbabwean people .
for a change the west seems to be taking positive action in helping zimbabwe , this should be applauded .
i 'm worried , though , by the fact that the western media highlights the suffering of white people in zimbabwe more than that of blacks .
we hear of white farmers dying in headlines while the killing of blacks is in small print , if at all mentioned .
ndumi , uk hurray !
not sure that it will have any effect on mugabe , but at least the world is making a stand .
perhaps the beginning of the end for mugabe .
ah , zimbabwean in uk " it 's about time the international community did something useful " peter james , zimbabwe it 's about time the international community did something useful .
it 's taken a long long time .
if it had been a white person in power , and he was murdering innocent people the world would of acted very quickly .
it seems that everyone is a bit scared of mugabe .
peter james , zimbabwe the commonwealth 's commitment to democracy is now in no doubt , neither is sa 's , nigeria 's or australia 's .
so far so good .
next step would be for sa to do some vigorous arm-twisting to get rgm to retire as soon as possible .
only then , perhaps , could there be a government of national unity with even a ghost of a chance of doing some good .
bill , usa absolutely , they were so right to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth , this should have been done sooner though .
they also need to decide what next step they are going to take as this can not go on , white farmers -lrb- not that it matters what colour they are -rrb- being killed because they are on african land , these white farmers have been there for generations like our blacks , asians etc have been here for generations and the uk is their country as much as it is ours , we can not let this go on as it will spread into the other african countries .
it is a pity that we can not work together as all of our blood is the same colour it does not matter what colour skin we have michelle , united kingdom " it has sent a stern warning that the commonwealth means business when it claims that it promotes and upholds values of democracy " cyprian kambili , malawian in uk the commonwealth has been right in suspending zimbabwe for a year - the decision is akin to an indictment with a strong unless and until zimbabwe government complies with the commonwealth harare principles it will face isolation and international reproach .
it has also sent a stern warning that the commonwealth means business when it claims that it promotes and upholds values of democracy .
any other decision in the light of the election fiasco in zimbabwe would have been welcoming anarchy into the commonwealth .
it would also have seriously and perhaps irretrievably have undermined the position and even perhaps the existence of commonwealth in the 21st century .
cyprian kambili , malawian in uk are zimbabweans not entitled to the same protection from the commonwealth that was given to the people of fiji ?
is democracy only one colour or for all colours ?
folks please stop patronizing zimbabweans .
we are suffering under an illegal regime that stole our sovereignty .
our voice must be heard .
our candidate must rule .
mugabe must go and the appeasement of his regime that has allowed him to remain in power over the last two years must stop .
jeqe , zimbabwean in uk its a good idea to officially blackball mugabe 's government but will this mean we white farmers will be left to our own devices ?
i hope not .
not after the events from the past few weeks .
a zimbabwean , harare " so zimbabwe will not be invited to the games in manchester .
big deal " andy sithole , zimbabwean in exile the common what ?
so zimbabwe will not be invited to the games in manchester .
big deal .
other than bruising mugabe 's ego i think it will strengthen his misplaced resolve .
what does a country have to do to be suspended from the united nations ?
i think the zimbabwean authorities are treading on that fine line and that would be effective .
africa and the world do not be fooled .
this is not a matter of black and white nor is it of north or south but a desperate attempt by an aging , yet crafty politician , to cling to power under the guise of righting the wrongs of the past .
we await president tsvangirai to take his rightful place .
andy sithole , zimbabwean in exile this is a welcome development as it sends a clear message to those dictators in africa who were planning similar tactics in the near future .
democracy has won decisively .
towera mchiwuno , denmark i think the commonwealth did the right thing by suspending zimbabwe .
the problem is zimbabwe 's african neighbours do n't and wo n't help because of their natural borders .
they are reliant on zimbabwe .
herein lies the problem .
the fall in economic development par se in the sadc countries has no political clout and that is the real traveristy because it does n't just affect the people in zimbabwe it affects others in zambia and malawi to name a few countries .

zimbabwe has been suspended from the commonwealth for a year with immediate effect .
the decision was taken by the commonwealth " troika " which was mandated to review the presidential elections in zimbabwe .
leaders of australia , nigeria and south africa agreed with commonwealth observers that the campaign had been marred by violence and intimidation .
the poll was also criticized by the usa , the european union and the uk .
was the commonwealth right to suspend zimbabwe ?
what difference will this decision make ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction i feel it 's very wrong to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth barrats , india / uk i feel it 's very wrong to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth .
i think the very reason behind this is that president mugabe won the election which barred the chances of uk , usa and western european countries to set up a puppet government and get all their wishes done .
the winning of mugabe has given some chance to breath , struggle and strive for their own good barrats , india / uk i believe that all the people in the country will suffer .
the poor will suffer the most .
barbados the commonwealth is wasting its time .
mugabe has no intent of giving up power .
by hook or by crook , he will stay in power .
alan noma , canada like most other issues around the world , suspending zimbabwe does not solve the root cause of the matter - which is how can the real owners of the land in zimbabwe be given back their land oladimeji , nigeria the commonwealth is getting a little ahead of itself if it thinks suspension will achieve much - it 's a toothless organisation with no particular relevance , and certainly with very little resolve .
don mckinnon and his crowd could 've and should 've acted far more decisively in highlighting to the world the desperate state of zimbabwe before 2000 's general election .
it may have made a difference back then .
darren oldfield , uk this is an incredible tragedy brought on by an old man desperately trying to keep himself in power richard wisecarver , alaska i think that most of the news and commentary miss the point .
mugabe has damaged the country in several horrible ways .
he has laid the foundation for a long term civil war , and he has cut off all hope of real economic progress .
no one in his right mind would invest a dime in the country .
he has guaranteed that any successful investment would be ceased as a matter of course with the justification of racial revenge .
i can not picture sane investor from any part of the world , of any race throwing good money after bad .
there were many ways to put these contested lands back into the hands of the black majority .
this was the worst possible choice .
breaking commercial farms into subsistence farms is a guarantee of continuing poverty for those who take up those lands .
it takes away the homes and jobs of farm workers who live on the land already and it destroys a major source of export income that zimbabwe needs .
this is not to mention the food that they produce for the nation .
zimbabwe can not afford to import food that it should produce .
this is an incredible tragedy brought on by an old man desperately trying to keep himself in power at all costs .
i will predict that many thousands will die as a result of the impending civil war , economic chaos and the flight of world capital .
many third world countries struggle just to survive , while others like zimbabwe and palestine rush toward chaos and horror with eyes wide open .
richard wisecarver , wasilla , alaska the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth for mugabe 's hostilities , intimidation and elimination of civilian lives for his political survival is genuine and applauded .
even to impose economic sanction would n't be a bad idea to get mugabe to feel the pinch of his actions and draconian rule but it is only the ordinary citizens who will suffer the most .
dale , uk that was the most sensible thing for the commonwealth to do .
though too late .
it is surprising how some non zimbabweans glorify mugabe because of their rabid hatred for the west .
please fight your own wars with the colonialists and stop using zimbabweans .
the majority of the people who are being killed , maimed and displaced in zimbabwe are blacks and not white farmers .
the man does not like opposition and that is the reason for all our suffering .
i wish you could have a page for zimbabweans only and i tell you , you will be surprised what people will write .
lazarus , zimbabwe zimbabwe 's suspension from the commonwealth is too little too late .
the people of zimbabwe have suffered enough and for a long time under this despotic ruler .
suspension at this stage will hardly even scratch the surface in changing that .
as ordinary zimbabweans , we feel betrayed in a way , by the world and anyone who is in a position to help us out of this .
we want to be free .
the electoral process seemed to have failed us yet again because it can be rigged .
we have never known good governance .
could somebody out there please help !
vm , zimbabwe why does the west feel that sanctions are the panacea in resolving the many problems in africa ?
deckey boy , liberia why does the west feel that sanctions are the panacea in resolving the many problems in africa ?
sanctions have rather proven counterproductive as seen in libya , liberia , sudan etc .
they only the very people that are to be protected and drag the country into deeper destitution .
any sober-minded person can see that the sanctions imposed on zimbabwe are far from what transpired during the election .
great britain is only using this election issue as a stepping stone to get back at mugabe for his drastic land reform - all at the expense of poor zimbabweans .
my fellow africans when will we ever see the light ?
deckey boy , liberia i think zimbabwe should not have been suspended from the commonwealth , and the western world is interested in this matter only because of the white farmers in the country .
there have been many african elections like this one , but no western politician ever said anything about it .
and also , let 's look at george bush 's own election , as there are lots of questions to be asked about it .
smith , england the west seems to care more for the white farmers , and possibly even their dogs , than it does about the rest of black africa yanni mbandi , usa - cameroon the barbarism of dr mugabe 's followers appals me .
but a sense of justice constrains me from condemning it without also identifying its roots - britain 's own past treacheries .
the west seems to care more for the white farmers , and possibly even their dogs , than it does about the rest of black africa .
europeans and especially british are taking this election seriously because of the white farmers .
if britain is very serious about democracy in africa , it should be at the front at all times and not only in one special area .
there was little outcry when guinea held a referendum last year that paved the way for president lansana conte , a key western ally in the region , to rule for the duration of his life .
it is scandalous and hypocritical that there should be such obvious double standards , and we have to ask ourselves why that should be .
you will find answers in the reasons why africans were enslaved and colonized .
yanni mbandi , usa - cameroon the commonwealth was wrong to suspend zimbabwe because it means nothing at this stage .
the main difference now will be that the commonwealth as such lost the right to express any opinion or influence the situation in zimbabwe .
mugabe can not care less if he going to receive the offer of rejoining the club in a year or not .
this on the other hand , will give him even more space to continue his involvement in drc and sell out the country to libyan and other governments interested in territorial or mineral riches .
the only right solution in this situation is that mbeki and other sadc leaders wake up and realise that mugabe means trouble .
what do you do with a brother who hurts the family ?
you forgive him but you do n't let him hurt the family any more .
tsitsi , zim & uk the commonwealth has carried out it 's obligation to improve the human rights and democratic rights of the people of zimbabwe .
the rights of all zimbabweans are at stake here , not just a tribe , a race , a political party !
land issues are for the people of zimbabwe to decide democratically on , not to satisfy any other country .
alec , uk we have to be happy because the colonial masters are realising that their time is up !
vusumzi mpongo , south africa the commonwealth suspends zimbabwe ...
so what ?
africans have to be happy about this .
we have to be happy because the colonial masters are realising that their time is up !
the commonwealth is a mechanism to monitor africans - a perpetuation of colonialism , and thus a tool for further oppression and suppression .
mugabe is giving africans a message : it is time we stood against oppression in all forms .
we must always refer to history .
it happened in the congo , and imperialism consumed lumumba .
puppets of imperialism entrapped , at their masters ' orders , and killed lumumba .
why ?
because he had vowed to stand firm against colonialism .
it is time for african renaissance , and that renaissance must start with africans seeking and getting their independence .
vusumzi mpongo , south africa mugabe and his cronies still have food on their tables while most of our relatives back home are starving .
it is about time some military or forceful means were used to rid the country of this tyrant , before he fools another strong opposition into forming a government of national unity !
charles bongani , uk yes sanctions were rightly imposed on zimbabwe , but its too little , too late .
they should have acted long ago , without giving the so-called hierarchy notice that it was going to happen .
those of you who have not seen what has come of zimbabwe in the last few years should not even have the nerve to air your arrogant remarks , without knowing the extent to which people are suffering , and the difficulties the average families have to survive .
economic , and regional ruin is what lies ahead if something is not done and done quick .
zanu pf made a mockery out of democracy .
i 'd rather the west interfere .
once proud zimbabwean , uk mugabe 's behaviour towards his people has been far worse that the smith regime 's before him mdy , an african in uk mugabe 's behaviour towards his people has been far worse that the smith regime 's before him .
he should be heavily sanctioned by all freedom loving people around the world for his treatment of the matebele , his own people , and his violation of the institution of democracy .
zimbabwe needs liberation .
mdy , an african in uk i strongly feel that the commonwealth should not have suspended zimbabwe .
this only will help worsen the already ailing and staggering economic situation in the country .
rather it should have taken particular measures against specific individuals which it claims are violating human rights .
my question is : who is a more serious human rights abuser , one who sponsors all these political clashes , wars and genocides or one who strives to get back what has been unlawfully taken away from him , that is the land itself in this case ?
let zimbabweans solve their domestic disputes alone .
n. mutoworera , zimbabwe excellent move , although i am positive it will not affect mugabe !
he wants the land for his ' people ' but what have they done with the land ?
they are incapable of thinking for themselves to farm grain and provide for their people .
independence was won in 1980 and yet the black man has not risen up and shown the world what he can do with the country .
c alexander , south african i never knew that the commonwealth still existed !
anock banda , proud african i never knew that the commonwealth still existed !
well pretty much leaves blair thinking he had the last laugh .
other than that you ca n't do anything about adding sanctions , and if you do then it just states that the west cares less about unimportant countries , for example zambia .
anock banda , proud african i do not care what sanctions the west imposes on us , as long as we can get back our land , have somewhere to live on and grow our own food .
soon the west will be a laughing stock for africa .
luke , zimbabwe i really do n't know what the international community gains from sanctions against the so-called dictators .
the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth would not yield a better life for zimbabweans , but it will bring about great suffering and bitterness among politicians .
i do n't support unnecessary interference of the west into african politics .
however , the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth should be a lesson to many african politicians , that if they think african politics should be left to africans , they should learn to protect and respect the rights of all citizens in the respective countries .
mwape.w , zambia do n't you realise that this illegitimate government will never respect the people who refuse him to power ?
gid , zimbabwe yes , it was a good move but do you know who is suffering and how ?
it is the mdc supporters , its leaders and anyone suspected to be mdc-affiliated .
zanu pf knows that it does no longer have any mandate to rule the country from the people .
it 's beating up and killing people-including the rural folks which have voted him to power .
is there a way of pressing for holding fresh elections ?
do n't you realise that this illegitimate government will never respect the people who refuse him to power ?
gid , zimbabwe all wrong by all means .
mugabe does not rule zimbabwe from common what ?
neither does he from britain nor usa .
the suspension is like a dog licking a bone .
address the land issue in a civilised way .
let 's prove that our democratic philosophy holds globally .
work on the core issues and success is our destiny by all routes .
sirengo , kenya a waste of time !
mugabe does n't care about the council as he knows very well that zimbabwe is still a commonwealth member .
council is just a tea and coffee club and mugabe can always make his own .
illusion created by media that suspension of zimbabwe from the council is a big deal is not helping opposition either .
now , they will be blamed for all the hardships .
p d nkwera , rsa the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth is not just in any way tropical lion the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth is not just in any way .
it only shows how the organisation is being dictated or inluenced by colonial ambitions and greed of former colonizer , the uk which still wants to impose its colonial empire of ideas and preaches propagandistic doctrines against any former colony that seems too independent in decision making .
so that is why the london mafias have been very busy in distorting the facts and misleading the whole world in issues regarding harare .
though suspended , zimbabwe or mugabe would not be deterred from land issue and any other things that are of great interest to the uk .
tropical lion i agree with many of the comments that have been made that this suspension , while a step in the right direction , will accomplish basically nothing .
mugabe is a dictator who promotes injustice and corruption , keeping his own skin intact by stirring up his peoples ' hatred against the " evil white imperialists . "
if it were n't for the millions of innocents it would hurt , it might be interesting to give these demagogues what they want and simply end all western involvement in their countries - no aid , no development help , no nothing .
i wonder how long their regimes would last then .
cody , usa why has it taken the enlightened west so long to discover that mugabe was not the liberationist hero that britain had previously and for so long portrayed him as being ?
john gs , australia the former golden-boy of the commonwealth , mugabe has presided over the country for nearly 22 years .
he has done so with the support of the entire zanu-pf party apparatus and more importantly , with valuable and abundant foreign aid from countries like britain , canada , australia , the united states .
why has it taken the enlightened west so long to discover that mugabe was not the liberationist hero that britain had previously and for so long portrayed him as being ?
the story does not add up .
tony blair 's spin-doctors and propagandists wo n't be able to cover up the reality of the economic and political situation in southern africa indefinitely .
john gs , australia when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers , bear this in mind .
lineo , lesotho given the way mugabe and zanu-pf behaved in the two years of their election campaign -lrb- deaths , torture , beatings , ' re-education ' camps -rrb- and now the brutal youth militia acted , it would have been criminal for the commonwealth to pretend that politics continues as normal in zimbabwe - so yes , it was right to suspend mugabe .
but what else ?
how can the people of zimbabwe be helped to overcome their political elite ?
ian love , zimbabwe better late than never .
james castro , usa finally some action against a tyrant and his cronies who are a disgrace to their country , to africa , to the world , and to the human race .
one day , they will be held accountable for the blood they have caused to be spilled , the dreadful damage they have caused to the innocents of their own country .
clarke slatter , usa let us deal with our leaders ourselves vicky k , zimbabwe no it was not the right thing .
mugabe may have wronged along the way but why are people not addressing what he is saying .
the land was grabbed from zimbabweans without any compensation .
it 's not a matter of mugabe or tsvangirai .
i know that even if we put tsvangirai in power he is also going to go through a lot of obstacles to get zimbabweans land .
if you come to zimbabwe we black people are still living in the western suburbs where fumes from industries blow and all the sewage flows .
in the rural areas we are living in rocky areas .
it easy for you guys in the west to call for sanctions because it is your weapon .
you have the financial might - you have the control .
everyone is talking about flaws .
what was flawed ?
you guys finance the wars in africa .
how can a small country like rwanda finance a war for 4 years ?
how does unita survive financially ?
i hope one day that when making your decisions you will not be racially minded .
yours is a global dictatorship .
let us deal with our leaders ourselves .
vicky k , zimbabwe the very least that the commonwealth should have done was to suspend zimbabwe .
this should have been done a long time ago , after the travesty of the previous general election .
i 've spent many years going back and forth to zimbabwe , my wife is a shona woman , and in the twelve years since i first went there , i 've seen the country go from a potential economic power house to the economic disaster it has become today .
as the former colonial rulers , the uk has a special responsibility to zimbabwe , and it 's a responsibility we 've been content to abrogate for far too long ; the result of which is that we , and the rest of the western nations will be forced through simple humanitarian demands , to support the people , while their government goes on stealing from everyone it can , while it continues to laugh up it 's sleeve at us as it goes about the daily task of oppressing the rights of its population and intimidating anyone who dares to stand in opposition .
r p , england definitely , not .
you should realise , this a third world country which is relatively poor in education and economy .
your harsh action will only affect the ordinary people and certainly not the leaders .
you should advise mugabe to do it better in future and rectify the weaknesses .
warn them of these weakness and against doing it in the future .
this action can be considered as a revenge as a result of mugabe 's policy towards white people .
i do not agree with his policy but suspension is not the answer .
be objective please .
wan ashri , malaysia that was long overdue .
zimbabwe should have been suspended from the commonwealth 20 years with mugabe 's treatment of the matebele people .
thanks commonwealth for acting but we still need more help .
never have the black and white zimbabweans united so much to deal with a rogue leader who plays the race card to remain in power .
the zimbabwean issue is not about land , race or re-colonisation it is about a leader who has plundered his people and is afraid of leaving power for fear of being made to account for his record .
the people have suffered and we are glad that the wimp-like mbeki and obasanjo are now acting against mugabe .
thank you commonwealth but where are you sadc and oau ?
s dube , zimbabwe only the misguided , blind and blinkered people do favour west interference in zimbabwe .
why notice a stick in mugabe 's eye when not seeing the logs in commonwealth and west 's eyes ?
how do you define a dictator ?
if mugabe is one , then the world is full of them , with the worst of dictators found in the west .
nicholas m. ngoma , zimbabwe i hope what has happened to zimbabwe is a signal to all commonwealth countries whose leaders think they can govern their countries with no regard for human dignity .
through this action the commonwealth has shown its determination to uphold democracy , the rule of law and human rights .
congratulations !
mart , cameroon / usa tell us please what zimbabwe will lose as a result of this decision ?
abdullah , malaysia it uncovered the hypocrisy of the commonwealth as an institution tope agboola , nigeria to question one : it 's a yes for a right suspension , because mugabe really oppressed his own people .
to question two : it will make one bad difference on the continent as it uncovered the hypocrisy of the commonwealth as an institution .
that is without regard to who are members of the tripartite committee that took the suspension decision or on what basis it was taken .
it was all along " right " not to worry if the oppressive mugabe and his officials kept huge dollar accounts in swiss , british or us banks .
suddenly we begin to hear what we did n't know , that mugabe and his officials even had foreign bank accounts and assets , far in excess of their official entitlements .
suddenly , it became " wrong " not to freeze this wealth which the west has long closed eyes to .
god bless the zimbabwe crisis for revealing a new philosophy : you can have both a friend and a foe in one personality .
could i point out that the so-called credibility of the commonwealth does not fly in the face of a cold feet concerning speaking in clear policy stance against commonwealth nations that keep the ill-gotten wealth of african despots .
i hope this is not a bitter pill for the commonwealth at this her glorious moment of triumph .
tope agboola , nigeria the implications on the southern african region are disastrous .
while mugabe swans around in luxury , his people are starving - they do n't have the strength to react as those in the western world would .
' power ' has gone to mugabe 's head and frankly if africa wants to remain third world , it 's heading the right way by backing this tyrant .
andrew , south africa no , the commonwealth was not right to suspend zimbabwe , but it has no effect anyway at this point samuel banks , usa no , the commonwealth was not right to suspend zimbabwe , but it has no effect anyway at this point .
why is it that whenever you have an african nation with a leader that is n't afraid to stand up to european domination and rules , everyone gets so terrified ?
right or wrong , african nations need to become independent and bond together without outside interference , because that 's all europeans ever do in these types of situations is interfere and manipulate who they want in power .
i 'd like to see all african countries free from european intervention , but then , if that were to come to fruition , africa would be the new world 's terrorist haven , not the middle east .
samuel banks , usa the action taken by the commonwealth will have very little impact .
hit mugabe where it will hurt him most , freeze all of his personal bank accounts and assets across europe and deposit these monies into a fund for the future re-investment of a new zimbabwe .
bairbre ni breatnach , republic of ireland i 've been in mozambique and zimbabwe .
suspension is not enough .
it 's a joke .
as noted by several , mugabe could care less .
it 's time the attempt to portray mr. mugabe as someone who is righting the injustices black africans experienced at the hands of european colonialist stop .
mugabe and his thugs are criminals .
his only interest is himself .
he is righting no wrongs .
he is causing many .
everyone is so afraid of appearing to favour white folks that no one is willing to call a crooked black man crooked .
i do n't care what colour mugabe is , he is a crook .
bad for zimbabwe and bad for africa .
eu sanctions , ha .
he is laughing all the way to the bank .
take steps to remove him otherwise its all a waste of time and a joke .
i can only imagine what the world 's out cry would be if a white majority government was killing black farmers and taking away black farmers farms and land !
jim middleton , america why all this fuss about zimbabwe , all the extreme propaganda etc ?
i have to agree mugabe must go but all the british are worried about is the 4000 white farmers who own 80 % of zimbabwe 's fertile land !
hundreds have died in africa , but they do n't make it to the headlines , but one farmer . it 's a newsflash !
teddy , uk i can not say that there is absolute democracy in that country , but that they could at least vote is already great achievement for democracy peter andersson , sweden i have been in zimbabwe two years ago .
i can not say that there is absolute democracy in that country , but that they could at least vote is already great achievement for democracy .
what is saddening is that they are not allowed to cultivate it and bring democracy to maturity by their own way .
the magnitude of the interference of the " west " in a sovereign county like zimbabwe is frightening .
not only for zimbabweans but even for us " westerners " .
for me it seems that we are determined to dictate in every nations internal affairs as long as it fits our interest .
this can cause a lot of damage to us in the long run .
the young people in africa are very much aware of our behaviour that you can no more play tricky games with their integrity .
all the old and new clubs of the " west " is only designed to dictate africans .
please lets leave them alone and they can make it by themselves .
peter andersson , sweden mugabe is arrogant , ruthless and cunning .
yes they were dead right to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth if only the aim is to show mugabe that he is now isolated .
it would have been different had the south african observer team told the truth about the election and openly condemned all the irregularities .
i wish they knew that by just supporting mugabe because he is an african brother they signed the death warrants for thousands of zimbabweans .
maybe they feel they would face the same when it is their turn to cheat in an election .
shame on them !
nhamu chanandareka , zimbabwe shame to mugabe , shame to the eu community , shame to the commonweath .
for the past 22 years mugabe could n't carry on the land reform because he was your puppet .
afflicting with you now , you speak about the rule of law and human rights .
let 's speak about human right concerning middle east and australia .
let 's speak about human right and democracy to the fmi .
let 's speak about human right , the rule of law and democracy to your other african puppets who are still dictators and you are still supporting them .
shame to all of you .
ngoran , brazil / cameroon it seems to me to be a token ' slap on the wrist ' !
connie wessels , uk if , as has been mentioned many times on this page , the commonwealth is a largely ineffective and weak organisation , what good does it do to suspend zimbabwe from it ?
it seems to me to be a token ' slap on the wrist ' !
connie wessels , uk suspension from the commonwealth is of little consequence to mugabe .
that two african leaders were involved in this decision -lrb- albeit under duress -rrb- has more significance .
it was obvious from the outset that the future of southern africa , and the negard initiative , depended upon the outcome of the situation in zimbabwe .
the west has largely fallen for mugabe 's own propaganda , and emphasises the land question , and the black / white question .
most of mugabe 's actions were in pursuit of his wish to retain control of zanu-pf - many people within this party supported the idea of ousting mugabe before the general elections two years ago .
they were effectively silenced .
now , so too , have the majority of zimbabweans , both rural and urban .
mugabe must be removed by force - peacekeeping troops must be sent now - the alternative may be yet another protracted civil war .
matabele , zimbabwe richard nwankwo of nigeria writes in this column that he wants the commonwealth and eu to keep out of africa 's political processes .
great idea except , unfortunately , the africans wo n't let us !
every time there 's a food / medical / war crisis in africa , the ex-colonial powers are expected to bail in with food -lrb- ethiopia -rrb- , medical supplies and doctors -lrb- everywhere in africa -rrb- , and guns and soldiers -lrb- sierra leone - who , apparently , would like us to recolonise the place -rrb- - the money for all of which comes out of the nasty ex-colonials pockets !
doubtless , unless mugabe dies or is shot -lrb- hopefully the latter -rrb- , we will be called upon to do all the above yet again !
you ca n't have it both ways , mr nwankwo !
sue hudson , london , uk sanctions was a step in the right direction scott , south african in uk sanctions was a step in the right direction , the only thing that confuses me , is how come they can still enter the commonwealth games that is close by , and when the situation was reversed , south africa was banned from all games .
it seems the commonwealth make up their own rules as they go along .
scott , south african in uk i think people need to separate rhetoric from the facts .
suspending mugabe from the commonwealth is meaningless .
mugabe is a despot of little to no redeeming qualities .
zimbabwe 's problems , and those of africa as a whole , will not end with the removal of the mugabes of africa .
more dictators will follow in their paths .
do n't forget that these people have their deputies with much to lose from leaving power .
i do n't know where africa would be without colonisation , though i think that the assumption that it would be nowhere demonstrates the kind of arrogance that people like mugabe use to their benefit .
africa 's problems will eventually have to be solved by africans .
the idea of a few thousand people owning a third of a country 's land is repugnant , regardless of whether those people are white or black .
there are those that say that these white farmers are responsible for most of zimbabwe 's foreign exchange , and that is true .
but what do you expect when they own so much land ?
james , us no i do not think this will have any effect on what this country is experiencing .
it will only increase his hatred for the remaining whites and first world governments .
you need to realise how this man has such a hatred for non-africans in the true sense .
anonymous does the commonwealth really think that it is going to affect mugabe ?
martin leahy , zimbabwe -lrb- uk -rrb- suspending zimbabwe was the right thing to do .
but does the commonwealth really think that it is going to affect mugabe ?
if they do then they are as foolish as the people who voted for mugabe .
he does n't care about anything ; all he cares about is his skin .
sanctions are not going to stop his youths form killing people like terry ford , 53 , a farmer or like ernest gatsi , 34 , an mdc supporter .
these two are the most recent out of the hundreds that are dead .
how many more of our friends and family are we going to let him and his cronies murder and beat ?
martin leahy , zimbabwe -lrb- uk -rrb- there are so many dictators in commonwealth that mugabe looks like a saint .
mike aziz , vancouver , canada zimbabwe continues to be a lesson for all the free world .
legal plunder is still the order of the day and civil unrest is met with death or imprisonment .
i suggest the free world just take notes and watch while this whole situation self-destructs .
once this happens , then civilized people can attempt to reconstruct a society that enforces individual rights and property rights .
james gammon , usa suspending is a right step but more needs to be done to help the people taco , netherlands suspending is a right step but more needs to be done to help the people .
meanwhile mugabe is having his way , using his youth brigade and so-called vets to do the dirty work .
time to really interfere i would say !
or , do we wait till mugabe -lrb- again -rrb- has cleaned out his opponents like he did in matabeleland years ago .
taco , netherlands banning zimbabwe from the commonwealth means nothing to mugabe .
as long has he is one of the wealthiest dictators around , and his wife can shop at harrods , what does he care ?
i think the best move would be to put him in a cell in the hague .
i 'm sure he has a lot to talk to milosevic about .
andrew lees , uk the suspension of zimbabwe is just another arrogant move to meddle in african affairs .
ahmed mussa , sweden very amusing reading , all the comments about the terrible things the colonials did .
i would be fascinated to see where ex-colonies would be today had they not been colonised .
come on - how long are the mugabes of the world going to keep blaming the state of their countries on ' white imperialism ' ?
you 've had plenty of time to sort yourselves out but instead have almost without exception allowed corruption to drive your countries into the ground .
the colonials may have done some bad things , but you are not helping yourself or zimbabwe , mr mugabe .
matt , uk , ex kenya i think the commonwealth took the right decision -lrb- about the only time it 's ever done anything useful ! -rrb-
sue hudson , london , uk i think the commonwealth took the right decision -lrb- about the only time it 's ever done anything useful ! -rrb- .
pity no-one has suspended his overseas bank accounts ...
however , mugabe 's getting old , he 'll be in his 80s when the next elections come round , once rich zimbabwe will be poverty-stricken , its beautiful fertile lands barren because no-one will be left who knows how to farm them , its economic infrastructure will be non-existent because tourists wo n't visit and no-one will risk investing money in the country .
i guess it 's just a toss-up between whether old age or a bullet gets to mugabe first !
whatever happens , you can only keep a people oppressed , starving , and in poverty for so long .
hopefully the zimbabweans will rise up sooner rather than later , and zimbabwe can once again take its rightful place in the world .
sue hudson , london , uk mugabe should be sitting next to milosevic in the court at the hague being tried for mass murder .
les , scotland the decision to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth is welcomed and long overdue .
if the election was neither free nor fair , then the present government of mugabe should not be recognised at all .
the eu should withdraw all its ambassadors from country so should the us and all commonwealth partners as a legitimate sign protest .
mugabe needs to feel the pinch because at the moment the only thing that will make him see sense is death .
he wants to take the country down with him .
but because of the blatant and hypocritical double standards of the west when it comes to these critical issues , i do n't see anyone making such a bold move .
there should one rule , for all , not for some .
victor kaitell , uk zimbabwe has been hurt more by the division between black and white than by mugabe joseph chifamba , zimbabwe no .
zimbabwe has been hurt more by the division between black and white than by mugabe .
he is only speaking on behalf of the downtrodden oppressed zimbabweans , the peasants who agree that the land belongs to them and who are too poor to even contribute their views in this forum .
joseph chifamba , zimbabwe well congrats to presidents mbeki and obasanjo for taking this action .
it is a pity ; this was not done before the election .
now is the time to put mass pressure on the mugabe regime .
this will certainly work .
the international community , must isolate zimbabwe , until zanu pf has no choice but to call new elections .
the only way forward for zimbabwe is a complete change in government .
change is always difficult initially , but it will benefit zimbabwe fully .
south africa was isolated in such a way until the apartheid regime capitulated .
the people of zimbabwe need to be free .
the struggle is now against mugabe and his illegal government .
rouan , uk yes .
i think it was right to suspend zimbabwe because it shows just how fickle the presence of the commonwealth is .
it is a relic of colonialism and at a time like this with the " white " powers against mugabe and the african powers against or neutral because of fear of retribution in the form of withdrawn financial aid it just exposes what principles the commonwealth was built on .
kottey , uk i think the fact that the swiss banks have frozen mugabe 's offshore bank accounts will have more effect that the suspension from the common wealth .
gretl coudrille , uk the next action should be banning robert mugabe , his immediate family members and government officials , from entering any commonwealth country jacob babarinde , nigerian , in the uk the next action should be banning robert mugabe , his immediate family members and government officials , from entering any commonwealth country until he bows out of power .
alternatively , he could be given the latitude to form a government of unity with the opposition .
the law-abiding people of zimbabwe have had enough of this power hungry man who should not be allowed to impoverish the poor any further .
jacob babarinde , nigerian , in the uk absolutely !
president mugabe is a disgrace to forward looking africans .
of course opportunists would look at this is a different light !
john ekaju , kenya absolutely right !
african leaders who claim that the election in zimbabwe was free and fair only reveal how they themselves come to power through a similarly " free and fair " election .
a typical case of scratch my back - i will scratch yours .
dictators have no eyes to recognise true democracy .
alex lengeju , tanzania " we believe in the liberty of the individual under the law , in equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender , race , colour , creed or political belief , and in the individual 's inalienable right to participate by means of free and democratic political processes in framing the society in which he or she lives ; " - harare declaration , 20 october 1991 .
if mugabe ca n't follow the rules he should n't be in the club .
the commonwealth would be betraying its own principles if it suffered zimbabwe to remain a member .
steve sholl , uk the mugabe regime is determined to stay in power at all costs , so more action is required against them , the usa must step up its efforts to investigate zanupf for its links with the taleban and the al-qaeda and also be dealt with accordingly and that 's the only way that can move them .
obert , zimbabwe suspension from the commonwealth is a victory for mugabe charles , uk and usa suspension from the commonwealth is a victory for mugabe .
it further distances what he perceives as ' white colonial ' intervention from his playpen and lessens our ability to exert influence on the affairs of zimbabwe .
the suspension is morally right but is too late to be positive .
we did not tolerate such governments in kosovo , bosnia and afghanistan and actually resorted to military force to replace them .
we may now have shut out all other options for zimbabwe .
charles , uk and usa i have a feeling that the commonwealth suspension of zimbabwe for a token one year , lacks the will and the " teeth " necessary to bring about change within this country , especially when they get a pass to participate in the commonwealth games , and the australian cricket team agrees to tour zimbabwe .
what is incongruous is the call for urgent financial aid by the eu and commonwealth members to offset the destruction of the zimbabwe economy by the target of a commonwealth suspension !
this does not make any sense ?
roger james , usa the suspension is well come but more must be done to press for fresh elections monitored by un , eu , commonwealth and must come to zimbabwe six months before the elections .
mbeki must be tougher on mugabe otherwise he will be the next mugabe in sa .
courage zvimba , zimbabwe i say forget the commonwealth , what do we gain being in it in the first place ?
human , planet earth what exactly is going to come out of this ?
more suffering for the zimbabwean people and more nonsense from the old man .
more should be done !
the commonwealth does not mean jack to zimbabweans except a way to run from zimbabwe to the uk and canada without needing a visa .
what else does the commonwealth mean ?
it 's just a symbol of the british empire which should by now be buried and forgotten about .
what is austrialian pm doing to redress the injustice done to the aborigines when the empire was amassing its common wealth ?
suspending zimbabwe or not , it does not make any difference to mugabe , his followers and the common man in zimbabwe .
pity those white " zimbabweans are crying foul now when one of them is killed , how many people are being killed as whole should be the question , not how many whites ?
another symbol of common wealth , for who ?
for the whites of course .
i say forget the commonwealth , what do we gain being in it in the first place ?
human , planet earth suspending zimbabwe was the " easy " thing to do .
if the world leaders are really true to their intentions they should now start doing something practical to improve the lives of zimbabweans -lrb- how about arresting mr m the first time he comes to london to shop or seek medical treatment ? -rrb- .
nico , italy the suspension means nothing much except that britain will not interfere in our affairs directly .
we do n't wish to rejoin the club in the future mwana w

the decision was taken by the commonwealth " troika " which was mandated to review the presidential elections in zimbabwe .
leaders of australia , nigeria and south africa agreed with commonwealth observers that the campaign had been marred by violence and intimidation .
the poll was also criticized by the usa , the european union and the uk .
was the commonwealth right to suspend zimbabwe ?
what difference will this decision make ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction i feel it 's very wrong to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth barrats , india / uk i feel it 's very wrong to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth .
i think the very reason behind this is that president mugabe won the election which barred the chances of uk , usa and western european countries to set up a puppet government and get all their wishes done .
the winning of mugabe has given some chance to breath , struggle and strive for their own good barrats , india / uk i believe that all the people in the country will suffer .
the poor will suffer the most .
barbados the commonwealth is wasting its time .
mugabe has no intent of giving up power .
by hook or by crook , he will stay in power .
alan noma , canada like most other issues around the world , suspending zimbabwe does not solve the root cause of the matter - which is how can the real owners of the land in zimbabwe be given back their land oladimeji , nigeria the commonwealth is getting a little ahead of itself if it thinks suspension will achieve much - it 's a toothless organisation with no particular relevance , and certainly with very little resolve .
don mckinnon and his crowd could 've and should 've acted far more decisively in highlighting to the world the desperate state of zimbabwe before 2000 's general election .
it may have made a difference back then .
darren oldfield , uk this is an incredible tragedy brought on by an old man desperately trying to keep himself in power richard wisecarver , alaska i think that most of the news and commentary miss the point .
mugabe has damaged the country in several horrible ways .
he has laid the foundation for a long term civil war , and he has cut off all hope of real economic progress .
no one in his right mind would invest a dime in the country .
he has guaranteed that any successful investment would be ceased as a matter of course with the justification of racial revenge .
i can not picture sane investor from any part of the world , of any race throwing good money after bad .
there were many ways to put these contested lands back into the hands of the black majority .
this was the worst possible choice .
breaking commercial farms into subsistence farms is a guarantee of continuing poverty for those who take up those lands .
it takes away the homes and jobs of farm workers who live on the land already and it destroys a major source of export income that zimbabwe needs .
this is not to mention the food that they produce for the nation .
zimbabwe can not afford to import food that it should produce .
this is an incredible tragedy brought on by an old man desperately trying to keep himself in power at all costs .
i will predict that many thousands will die as a result of the impending civil war , economic chaos and the flight of world capital .
many third world countries struggle just to survive , while others like zimbabwe and palestine rush toward chaos and horror with eyes wide open .
richard wisecarver , wasilla , alaska the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth for mugabe 's hostilities , intimidation and elimination of civilian lives for his political survival is genuine and applauded .
even to impose economic sanction would n't be a bad idea to get mugabe to feel the pinch of his actions and draconian rule but it is only the ordinary citizens who will suffer the most .
dale , uk that was the most sensible thing for the commonwealth to do .
though too late .
it is surprising how some non zimbabweans glorify mugabe because of their rabid hatred for the west .
please fight your own wars with the colonialists and stop using zimbabweans .
the majority of the people who are being killed , maimed and displaced in zimbabwe are blacks and not white farmers .
the man does not like opposition and that is the reason for all our suffering .
i wish you could have a page for zimbabweans only and i tell you , you will be surprised what people will write .
lazarus , zimbabwe zimbabwe 's suspension from the commonwealth is too little too late .
the people of zimbabwe have suffered enough and for a long time under this despotic ruler .
suspension at this stage will hardly even scratch the surface in changing that .
as ordinary zimbabweans , we feel betrayed in a way , by the world and anyone who is in a position to help us out of this .
we want to be free .
the electoral process seemed to have failed us yet again because it can be rigged .
we have never known good governance .
could somebody out there please help !
vm , zimbabwe why does the west feel that sanctions are the panacea in resolving the many problems in africa ?
deckey boy , liberia why does the west feel that sanctions are the panacea in resolving the many problems in africa ?
sanctions have rather proven counterproductive as seen in libya , liberia , sudan etc .
they only the very people that are to be protected and drag the country into deeper destitution .
any sober-minded person can see that the sanctions imposed on zimbabwe are far from what transpired during the election .
great britain is only using this election issue as a stepping stone to get back at mugabe for his drastic land reform - all at the expense of poor zimbabweans .
my fellow africans when will we ever see the light ?
deckey boy , liberia i think zimbabwe should not have been suspended from the commonwealth , and the western world is interested in this matter only because of the white farmers in the country .
there have been many african elections like this one , but no western politician ever said anything about it .
and also , let 's look at george bush 's own election , as there are lots of questions to be asked about it .
smith , england the west seems to care more for the white farmers , and possibly even their dogs , than it does about the rest of black africa yanni mbandi , usa - cameroon the barbarism of dr mugabe 's followers appals me .
but a sense of justice constrains me from condemning it without also identifying its roots - britain 's own past treacheries .
the west seems to care more for the white farmers , and possibly even their dogs , than it does about the rest of black africa .
europeans and especially british are taking this election seriously because of the white farmers .
if britain is very serious about democracy in africa , it should be at the front at all times and not only in one special area .
there was little outcry when guinea held a referendum last year that paved the way for president lansana conte , a key western ally in the region , to rule for the duration of his life .
it is scandalous and hypocritical that there should be such obvious double standards , and we have to ask ourselves why that should be .
you will find answers in the reasons why africans were enslaved and colonized .
yanni mbandi , usa - cameroon the commonwealth was wrong to suspend zimbabwe because it means nothing at this stage .
the main difference now will be that the commonwealth as such lost the right to express any opinion or influence the situation in zimbabwe .
mugabe can not care less if he going to receive the offer of rejoining the club in a year or not .
this on the other hand , will give him even more space to continue his involvement in drc and sell out the country to libyan and other governments interested in territorial or mineral riches .
the only right solution in this situation is that mbeki and other sadc leaders wake up and realise that mugabe means trouble .
what do you do with a brother who hurts the family ?
you forgive him but you do n't let him hurt the family any more .
tsitsi , zim & uk the commonwealth has carried out it 's obligation to improve the human rights and democratic rights of the people of zimbabwe .
the rights of all zimbabweans are at stake here , not just a tribe , a race , a political party !
land issues are for the people of zimbabwe to decide democratically on , not to satisfy any other country .
alec , uk we have to be happy because the colonial masters are realising that their time is up !
vusumzi mpongo , south africa the commonwealth suspends zimbabwe ...
so what ?
africans have to be happy about this .
we have to be happy because the colonial masters are realising that their time is up !
the commonwealth is a mechanism to monitor africans - a perpetuation of colonialism , and thus a tool for further oppression and suppression .
mugabe is giving africans a message : it is time we stood against oppression in all forms .
we must always refer to history .
it happened in the congo , and imperialism consumed lumumba .
puppets of imperialism entrapped , at their masters ' orders , and killed lumumba .
why ?
because he had vowed to stand firm against colonialism .
it is time for african renaissance , and that renaissance must start with africans seeking and getting their independence .
vusumzi mpongo , south africa mugabe and his cronies still have food on their tables while most of our relatives back home are starving .
it is about time some military or forceful means were used to rid the country of this tyrant , before he fools another strong opposition into forming a government of national unity !
charles bongani , uk yes sanctions were rightly imposed on zimbabwe , but its too little , too late .
they should have acted long ago , without giving the so-called hierarchy notice that it was going to happen .
those of you who have not seen what has come of zimbabwe in the last few years should not even have the nerve to air your arrogant remarks , without knowing the extent to which people are suffering , and the difficulties the average families have to survive .
economic , and regional ruin is what lies ahead if something is not done and done quick .
zanu pf made a mockery out of democracy .
i 'd rather the west interfere .
once proud zimbabwean , uk mugabe 's behaviour towards his people has been far worse that the smith regime 's before him mdy , an african in uk mugabe 's behaviour towards his people has been far worse that the smith regime 's before him .
he should be heavily sanctioned by all freedom loving people around the world for his treatment of the matebele , his own people , and his violation of the institution of democracy .
zimbabwe needs liberation .
mdy , an african in uk i strongly feel that the commonwealth should not have suspended zimbabwe .
this only will help worsen the already ailing and staggering economic situation in the country .
rather it should have taken particular measures against specific individuals which it claims are violating human rights .
my question is : who is a more serious human rights abuser , one who sponsors all these political clashes , wars and genocides or one who strives to get back what has been unlawfully taken away from him , that is the land itself in this case ?
let zimbabweans solve their domestic disputes alone .
n. mutoworera , zimbabwe excellent move , although i am positive it will not affect mugabe !
he wants the land for his ' people ' but what have they done with the land ?
they are incapable of thinking for themselves to farm grain and provide for their people .
independence was won in 1980 and yet the black man has not risen up and shown the world what he can do with the country .
c alexander , south african i never knew that the commonwealth still existed !
anock banda , proud african i never knew that the commonwealth still existed !
well pretty much leaves blair thinking he had the last laugh .
other than that you ca n't do anything about adding sanctions , and if you do then it just states that the west cares less about unimportant countries , for example zambia .
anock banda , proud african i do not care what sanctions the west imposes on us , as long as we can get back our land , have somewhere to live on and grow our own food .
soon the west will be a laughing stock for africa .
luke , zimbabwe i really do n't know what the international community gains from sanctions against the so-called dictators .
the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth would not yield a better life for zimbabweans , but it will bring about great suffering and bitterness among politicians .
i do n't support unnecessary interference of the west into african politics .
however , the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth should be a lesson to many african politicians , that if they think african politics should be left to africans , they should learn to protect and respect the rights of all citizens in the respective countries .
mwape.w , zambia do n't you realise that this illegitimate government will never respect the people who refuse him to power ?
gid , zimbabwe yes , it was a good move but do you know who is suffering and how ?
it is the mdc supporters , its leaders and anyone suspected to be mdc-affiliated .
zanu pf knows that it does no longer have any mandate to rule the country from the people .
it 's beating up and killing people-including the rural folks which have voted him to power .
is there a way of pressing for holding fresh elections ?
do n't you realise that this illegitimate government will never respect the people who refuse him to power ?
gid , zimbabwe all wrong by all means .
mugabe does not rule zimbabwe from common what ?
neither does he from britain nor usa .
the suspension is like a dog licking a bone .
address the land issue in a civilised way .
let 's prove that our democratic philosophy holds globally .
work on the core issues and success is our destiny by all routes .
sirengo , kenya a waste of time !
mugabe does n't care about the council as he knows very well that zimbabwe is still a commonwealth member .
council is just a tea and coffee club and mugabe can always make his own .
illusion created by media that suspension of zimbabwe from the council is a big deal is not helping opposition either .
now , they will be blamed for all the hardships .
p d nkwera , rsa the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth is not just in any way tropical lion the suspension of zimbabwe from the commonwealth is not just in any way .
it only shows how the organisation is being dictated or inluenced by colonial ambitions and greed of former colonizer , the uk which still wants to impose its colonial empire of ideas and preaches propagandistic doctrines against any former colony that seems too independent in decision making .
so that is why the london mafias have been very busy in distorting the facts and misleading the whole world in issues regarding harare .
though suspended , zimbabwe or mugabe would not be deterred from land issue and any other things that are of great interest to the uk .
tropical lion i agree with many of the comments that have been made that this suspension , while a step in the right direction , will accomplish basically nothing .
mugabe is a dictator who promotes injustice and corruption , keeping his own skin intact by stirring up his peoples ' hatred against the " evil white imperialists . "
if it were n't for the millions of innocents it would hurt , it might be interesting to give these demagogues what they want and simply end all western involvement in their countries - no aid , no development help , no nothing .
i wonder how long their regimes would last then .
cody , usa why has it taken the enlightened west so long to discover that mugabe was not the liberationist hero that britain had previously and for so long portrayed him as being ?
john gs , australia the former golden-boy of the commonwealth , mugabe has presided over the country for nearly 22 years .
he has done so with the support of the entire zanu-pf party apparatus and more importantly , with valuable and abundant foreign aid from countries like britain , canada , australia , the united states .
why has it taken the enlightened west so long to discover that mugabe was not the liberationist hero that britain had previously and for so long portrayed him as being ?
the story does not add up .
tony blair 's spin-doctors and propagandists wo n't be able to cover up the reality of the economic and political situation in southern africa indefinitely .
john gs , australia when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers , bear this in mind .
lineo , lesotho given the way mugabe and zanu-pf behaved in the two years of their election campaign -lrb- deaths , torture , beatings , ' re-education ' camps -rrb- and now the brutal youth militia acted , it would have been criminal for the commonwealth to pretend that politics continues as normal in zimbabwe - so yes , it was right to suspend mugabe .
but what else ?
how can the people of zimbabwe be helped to overcome their political elite ?
ian love , zimbabwe better late than never .
james castro , usa finally some action against a tyrant and his cronies who are a disgrace to their country , to africa , to the world , and to the human race .
one day , they will be held accountable for the blood they have caused to be spilled , the dreadful damage they have caused to the innocents of their own country .
clarke slatter , usa let us deal with our leaders ourselves vicky k , zimbabwe no it was not the right thing .
mugabe may have wronged along the way but why are people not addressing what he is saying .
the land was grabbed from zimbabweans without any compensation .
it 's not a matter of mugabe or tsvangirai .
i know that even if we put tsvangirai in power he is also going to go through a lot of obstacles to get zimbabweans land .
if you come to zimbabwe we black people are still living in the western suburbs where fumes from industries blow and all the sewage flows .
in the rural areas we are living in rocky areas .
it easy for you guys in the west to call for sanctions because it is your weapon .
you have the financial might - you have the control .
everyone is talking about flaws .
what was flawed ?
you guys finance the wars in africa .
how can a small country like rwanda finance a war for 4 years ?
how does unita survive financially ?
i hope one day that when making your decisions you will not be racially minded .
yours is a global dictatorship .
let us deal with our leaders ourselves .
vicky k , zimbabwe the very least that the commonwealth should have done was to suspend zimbabwe .
this should have been done a long time ago , after the travesty of the previous general election .
i 've spent many years going back and forth to zimbabwe , my wife is a shona woman , and in the twelve years since i first went there , i 've seen the country go from a potential economic power house to the economic disaster it has become today .
as the former colonial rulers , the uk has a special responsibility to zimbabwe , and it 's a responsibility we 've been content to abrogate for far too long ; the result of which is that we , and the rest of the western nations will be forced through simple humanitarian demands , to support the people , while their government goes on stealing from everyone it can , while it continues to laugh up it 's sleeve at us as it goes about the daily task of oppressing the rights of its population and intimidating anyone who dares to stand in opposition .
r p , england definitely , not .
you should realise , this a third world country which is relatively poor in education and economy .
your harsh action will only affect the ordinary people and certainly not the leaders .
you should advise mugabe to do it better in future and rectify the weaknesses .
warn them of these weakness and against doing it in the future .
this action can be considered as a revenge as a result of mugabe 's policy towards white people .
i do not agree with his policy but suspension is not the answer .
be objective please .
wan ashri , malaysia that was long overdue .
zimbabwe should have been suspended from the commonwealth 20 years with mugabe 's treatment of the matebele people .
thanks commonwealth for acting but we still need more help .
never have the black and white zimbabweans united so much to deal with a rogue leader who plays the race card to remain in power .
the zimbabwean issue is not about land , race or re-colonisation it is about a leader who has plundered his people and is afraid of leaving power for fear of being made to account for his record .
the people have suffered and we are glad that the wimp-like mbeki and obasanjo are now acting against mugabe .
thank you commonwealth but where are you sadc and oau ?
s dube , zimbabwe only the misguided , blind and blinkered people do favour west interference in zimbabwe .
why notice a stick in mugabe 's eye when not seeing the logs in commonwealth and west 's eyes ?
how do you define a dictator ?
if mugabe is one , then the world is full of them , with the worst of dictators found in the west .
nicholas m. ngoma , zimbabwe i hope what has happened to zimbabwe is a signal to all commonwealth countries whose leaders think they can govern their countries with no regard for human dignity .
through this action the commonwealth has shown its determination to uphold democracy , the rule of law and human rights .
congratulations !
mart , cameroon / usa tell us please what zimbabwe will lose as a result of this decision ?
abdullah , malaysia it uncovered the hypocrisy of the commonwealth as an institution tope agboola , nigeria to question one : it 's a yes for a right suspension , because mugabe really oppressed his own people .
to question two : it will make one bad difference on the continent as it uncovered the hypocrisy of the commonwealth as an institution .
that is without regard to who are members of the tripartite committee that took the suspension decision or on what basis it was taken .
it was all along " right " not to worry if the oppressive mugabe and his officials kept huge dollar accounts in swiss , british or us banks .
suddenly we begin to hear what we did n't know , that mugabe and his officials even had foreign bank accounts and assets , far in excess of their official entitlements .
suddenly , it became " wrong " not to freeze this wealth which the west has long closed eyes to .
god bless the zimbabwe crisis for revealing a new philosophy : you can have both a friend and a foe in one personality .
could i point out that the so-called credibility of the commonwealth does not fly in the face of a cold feet concerning speaking in clear policy stance against commonwealth nations that keep the ill-gotten wealth of african despots .
i hope this is not a bitter pill for the commonwealth at this her glorious moment of triumph .
tope agboola , nigeria the implications on the southern african region are disastrous .
while mugabe swans around in luxury , his people are starving - they do n't have the strength to react as those in the western world would .
' power ' has gone to mugabe 's head and frankly if africa wants to remain third world , it 's heading the right way by backing this tyrant .
andrew , south africa no , the commonwealth was not right to suspend zimbabwe , but it has no effect anyway at this point samuel banks , usa no , the commonwealth was not right to suspend zimbabwe , but it has no effect anyway at this point .
why is it that whenever you have an african nation with a leader that is n't afraid to stand up to european domination and rules , everyone gets so terrified ?
right or wrong , african nations need to become independent and bond together without outside interference , because that 's all europeans ever do in these types of situations is interfere and manipulate who they want in power .
i 'd like to see all african countries free from european intervention , but then , if that were to come to fruition , africa would be the new world 's terrorist haven , not the middle east .
samuel banks , usa the action taken by the commonwealth will have very little impact .
hit mugabe where it will hurt him most , freeze all of his personal bank accounts and assets across europe and deposit these monies into a fund for the future re-investment of a new zimbabwe .
bairbre ni breatnach , republic of ireland i 've been in mozambique and zimbabwe .
suspension is not enough .
it 's a joke .
as noted by several , mugabe could care less .
it 's time the attempt to portray mr. mugabe as someone who is righting the injustices black africans experienced at the hands of european colonialist stop .
mugabe and his thugs are criminals .
his only interest is himself .
he is righting no wrongs .
he is causing many .
everyone is so afraid of appearing to favour white folks that no one is willing to call a crooked black man crooked .
i do n't care what colour mugabe is , he is a crook .
bad for zimbabwe and bad for africa .
eu sanctions , ha .
he is laughing all the way to the bank .
take steps to remove him otherwise its all a waste of time and a joke .
i can only imagine what the world 's out cry would be if a white majority government was killing black farmers and taking away black farmers farms and land !
jim middleton , america why all this fuss about zimbabwe , all the extreme propaganda etc ?
i have to agree mugabe must go but all the british are worried about is the 4000 white farmers who own 80 % of zimbabwe 's fertile land !
hundreds have died in africa , but they do n't make it to the headlines , but one farmer . it 's a newsflash !
teddy , uk i can not say that there is absolute democracy in that country , but that they could at least vote is already great achievement for democracy peter andersson , sweden i have been in zimbabwe two years ago .
i can not say that there is absolute democracy in that country , but that they could at least vote is already great achievement for democracy .
what is saddening is that they are not allowed to cultivate it and bring democracy to maturity by their own way .
the magnitude of the interference of the " west " in a sovereign county like zimbabwe is frightening .
not only for zimbabweans but even for us " westerners " .
for me it seems that we are determined to dictate in every nations internal affairs as long as it fits our interest .
this can cause a lot of damage to us in the long run .
the young people in africa are very much aware of our behaviour that you can no more play tricky games with their integrity .
all the old and new clubs of the " west " is only designed to dictate africans .
please lets leave them alone and they can make it by themselves .
peter andersson , sweden mugabe is arrogant , ruthless and cunning .
yes they were dead right to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth if only the aim is to show mugabe that he is now isolated .
it would have been different had the south african observer team told the truth about the election and openly condemned all the irregularities .
i wish they knew that by just supporting mugabe because he is an african brother they signed the death warrants for thousands of zimbabweans .
maybe they feel they would face the same when it is their turn to cheat in an election .
shame on them !
nhamu chanandareka , zimbabwe shame to mugabe , shame to the eu community , shame to the commonweath .
for the past 22 years mugabe could n't carry on the land reform because he was your puppet .
afflicting with you now , you speak about the rule of law and human rights .
let 's speak about human right concerning middle east and australia .
let 's speak about human right and democracy to the fmi .
let 's speak about human right , the rule of law and democracy to your other african puppets who are still dictators and you are still supporting them .
shame to all of you .
ngoran , brazil / cameroon it seems to me to be a token ' slap on the wrist ' !
connie wessels , uk if , as has been mentioned many times on this page , the commonwealth is a largely ineffective and weak organisation , what good does it do to suspend zimbabwe from it ?
it seems to me to be a token ' slap on the wrist ' !
connie wessels , uk suspension from the commonwealth is of little consequence to mugabe .
that two african leaders were involved in this decision -lrb- albeit under duress -rrb- has more significance .
it was obvious from the outset that the future of southern africa , and the negard initiative , depended upon the outcome of the situation in zimbabwe .
the west has largely fallen for mugabe 's own propaganda , and emphasises the land question , and the black / white question .
most of mugabe 's actions were in pursuit of his wish to retain control of zanu-pf - many people within this party supported the idea of ousting mugabe before the general elections two years ago .
they were effectively silenced .
now , so too , have the majority of zimbabweans , both rural and urban .
mugabe must be removed by force - peacekeeping troops must be sent now - the alternative may be yet another protracted civil war .
matabele , zimbabwe richard nwankwo of nigeria writes in this column that he wants the commonwealth and eu to keep out of africa 's political processes .
great idea except , unfortunately , the africans wo n't let us !
every time there 's a food / medical / war crisis in africa , the ex-colonial powers are expected to bail in with food -lrb- ethiopia -rrb- , medical supplies and doctors -lrb- everywhere in africa -rrb- , and guns and soldiers -lrb- sierra leone - who , apparently , would like us to recolonise the place -rrb- - the money for all of which comes out of the nasty ex-colonials pockets !
doubtless , unless mugabe dies or is shot -lrb- hopefully the latter -rrb- , we will be called upon to do all the above yet again !
you ca n't have it both ways , mr nwankwo !
sue hudson , london , uk sanctions was a step in the right direction scott , south african in uk sanctions was a step in the right direction , the only thing that confuses me , is how come they can still enter the commonwealth games that is close by , and when the situation was reversed , south africa was banned from all games .
it seems the commonwealth make up their own rules as they go along .
scott , south african in uk i think people need to separate rhetoric from the facts .
suspending mugabe from the commonwealth is meaningless .
mugabe is a despot of little to no redeeming qualities .
zimbabwe 's problems , and those of africa as a whole , will not end with the removal of the mugabes of africa .
more dictators will follow in their paths .
do n't forget that these people have their deputies with much to lose from leaving power .
i do n't know where africa would be without colonisation , though i think that the assumption that it would be nowhere demonstrates the kind of arrogance that people like mugabe use to their benefit .
africa 's problems will eventually have to be solved by africans .
the idea of a few thousand people owning a third of a country 's land is repugnant , regardless of whether those people are white or black .
there are those that say that these white farmers are responsible for most of zimbabwe 's foreign exchange , and that is true .
but what do you expect when they own so much land ?
james , us no i do not think this will have any effect on what this country is experiencing .
it will only increase his hatred for the remaining whites and first world governments .
you need to realise how this man has such a hatred for non-africans in the true sense .
anonymous does the commonwealth really think that it is going to affect mugabe ?
martin leahy , zimbabwe -lrb- uk -rrb- suspending zimbabwe was the right thing to do .
but does the commonwealth really think that it is going to affect mugabe ?
if they do then they are as foolish as the people who voted for mugabe .
he does n't care about anything ; all he cares about is his skin .
sanctions are not going to stop his youths form killing people like terry ford , 53 , a farmer or like ernest gatsi , 34 , an mdc supporter .
these two are the most recent out of the hundreds that are dead .
how many more of our friends and family are we going to let him and his cronies murder and beat ?
martin leahy , zimbabwe -lrb- uk -rrb- there are so many dictators in commonwealth that mugabe looks like a saint .
mike aziz , vancouver , canada zimbabwe continues to be a lesson for all the free world .
legal plunder is still the order of the day and civil unrest is met with death or imprisonment .
i suggest the free world just take notes and watch while this whole situation self-destructs .
once this happens , then civilized people can attempt to reconstruct a society that enforces individual rights and property rights .
james gammon , usa suspending is a right step but more needs to be done to help the people taco , netherlands suspending is a right step but more needs to be done to help the people .
meanwhile mugabe is having his way , using his youth brigade and so-called vets to do the dirty work .
time to really interfere i would say !
or , do we wait till mugabe -lrb- again -rrb- has cleaned out his opponents like he did in matabeleland years ago .
taco , netherlands banning zimbabwe from the commonwealth means nothing to mugabe .
as long has he is one of the wealthiest dictators around , and his wife can shop at harrods , what does he care ?
i think the best move would be to put him in a cell in the hague .
i 'm sure he has a lot to talk to milosevic about .
andrew lees , uk the suspension of zimbabwe is just another arrogant move to meddle in african affairs .
ahmed mussa , sweden very amusing reading , all the comments about the terrible things the colonials did .
i would be fascinated to see where ex-colonies would be today had they not been colonised .
come on - how long are the mugabes of the world going to keep blaming the state of their countries on ' white imperialism ' ?
you 've had plenty of time to sort yourselves out but instead have almost without exception allowed corruption to drive your countries into the ground .
the colonials may have done some bad things , but you are not helping yourself or zimbabwe , mr mugabe .
matt , uk , ex kenya i think the commonwealth took the right decision -lrb- about the only time it 's ever done anything useful ! -rrb-
sue hudson , london , uk i think the commonwealth took the right decision -lrb- about the only time it 's ever done anything useful ! -rrb- .
pity no-one has suspended his overseas bank accounts ...
however , mugabe 's getting old , he 'll be in his 80s when the next elections come round , once rich zimbabwe will be poverty-stricken , its beautiful fertile lands barren because no-one will be left who knows how to farm them , its economic infrastructure will be non-existent because tourists wo n't visit and no-one will risk investing money in the country .
i guess it 's just a toss-up between whether old age or a bullet gets to mugabe first !
whatever happens , you can only keep a people oppressed , starving , and in poverty for so long .
hopefully the zimbabweans will rise up sooner rather than later , and zimbabwe can once again take its rightful place in the world .
sue hudson , london , uk mugabe should be sitting next to milosevic in the court at the hague being tried for mass murder .
les , scotland the decision to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth is welcomed and long overdue .
if the election was neither free nor fair , then the present government of mugabe should not be recognised at all .
the eu should withdraw all its ambassadors from country so should the us and all commonwealth partners as a legitimate sign protest .
mugabe needs to feel the pinch because at the moment the only thing that will make him see sense is death .
he wants to take the country down with him .
but because of the blatant and hypocritical double standards of the west when it comes to these critical issues , i do n't see anyone making such a bold move .
there should one rule , for all , not for some .
victor kaitell , uk zimbabwe has been hurt more by the division between black and white than by mugabe joseph chifamba , zimbabwe no .
zimbabwe has been hurt more by the division between black and white than by mugabe .
he is only speaking on behalf of the downtrodden oppressed zimbabweans , the peasants who agree that the land belongs to them and who are too poor to even contribute their views in this forum .
joseph chifamba , zimbabwe well congrats to presidents mbeki and obasanjo for taking this action .
it is a pity ; this was not done before the election .
now is the time to put mass pressure on the mugabe regime .
this will certainly work .
the international community , must isolate zimbabwe , until zanu pf has no choice but to call new elections .
the only way forward for zimbabwe is a complete change in government .
change is always difficult initially , but it will benefit zimbabwe fully .
south africa was isolated in such a way until the apartheid regime capitulated .
the people of zimbabwe need to be free .
the struggle is now against mugabe and his illegal government .
rouan , uk yes .
i think it was right to suspend zimbabwe because it shows just how fickle the presence of the commonwealth is .
it is a relic of colonialism and at a time like this with the " white " powers against mugabe and the african powers against or neutral because of fear of retribution in the form of withdrawn financial aid it just exposes what principles the commonwealth was built on .
kottey , uk i think the fact that the swiss banks have frozen mugabe 's offshore bank accounts will have more effect that the suspension from the common wealth .
gretl coudrille , uk the next action should be banning robert mugabe , his immediate family members and government officials , from entering any commonwealth country jacob babarinde , nigerian , in the uk the next action should be banning robert mugabe , his immediate family members and government officials , from entering any commonwealth country until he bows out of power .
alternatively , he could be given the latitude to form a government of unity with the opposition .
the law-abiding people of zimbabwe have had enough of this power hungry man who should not be allowed to impoverish the poor any further .
jacob babarinde , nigerian , in the uk absolutely !
president mugabe is a disgrace to forward looking africans .
of course opportunists would look at this is a different light !
john ekaju , kenya absolutely right !
african leaders who claim that the election in zimbabwe was free and fair only reveal how they themselves come to power through a similarly " free and fair " election .
a typical case of scratch my back - i will scratch yours .
dictators have no eyes to recognise true democracy .
alex lengeju , tanzania " we believe in the liberty of the individual under the law , in equal rights for all citizens regardless of gender , race , colour , creed or political belief , and in the individual 's inalienable right to participate by means of free and democratic political processes in framing the society in which he or she lives ; " - harare declaration , 20 october 1991 .
if mugabe ca n't follow the rules he should n't be in the club .
the commonwealth would be betraying its own principles if it suffered zimbabwe to remain a member .
steve sholl , uk the mugabe regime is determined to stay in power at all costs , so more action is required against them , the usa must step up its efforts to investigate zanupf for its links with the taleban and the al-qaeda and also be dealt with accordingly and that 's the only way that can move them .
obert , zimbabwe suspension from the commonwealth is a victory for mugabe charles , uk and usa suspension from the commonwealth is a victory for mugabe .
it further distances what he perceives as ' white colonial ' intervention from his playpen and lessens our ability to exert influence on the affairs of zimbabwe .
the suspension is morally right but is too late to be positive .
we did not tolerate such governments in kosovo , bosnia and afghanistan and actually resorted to military force to replace them .
we may now have shut out all other options for zimbabwe .
charles , uk and usa i have a feeling that the commonwealth suspension of zimbabwe for a token one year , lacks the will and the " teeth " necessary to bring about change within this country , especially when they get a pass to participate in the commonwealth games , and the australian cricket team agrees to tour zimbabwe .
what is incongruous is the call for urgent financial aid by the eu and commonwealth members to offset the destruction of the zimbabwe economy by the target of a commonwealth suspension !
this does not make any sense ?
roger james , usa the suspension is well come but more must be done to press for fresh elections monitored by un , eu , commonwealth and must come to zimbabwe six months before the elections .
mbeki must be tougher on mugabe otherwise he will be the next mugabe in sa .
courage zvimba , zimbabwe i say forget the commonwealth , what do we gain being in it in the first place ?
human , planet earth what exactly is going to come out of this ?
more suffering for the zimbabwean people and more nonsense from the old man .
more should be done !
the commonwealth does not mean jack to zimbabweans except a way to run from zimbabwe to the uk and canada without needing a visa .
what else does the commonwealth mean ?
it 's just a symbol of the british empire which should by now be buried and forgotten about .
what is austrialian pm doing to redress the injustice done to the aborigines when the empire was amassing its common wealth ?
suspending zimbabwe or not , it does not make any difference to mugabe , his followers and the common man in zimbabwe .
pity those white " zimbabweans are crying foul now when one of them is killed , how many people are being killed as whole should be the question , not how many whites ?
another symbol of common wealth , for who ?
for the whites of course .
i say forget the commonwealth , what do we gain being in it in the first place ?
human , planet earth suspending zimbabwe was the " easy " thing to do .
if the world leaders are really true to their intentions they should now start doing something practical to improve the lives of zimbabweans -lrb- how about arresting mr m the first time he comes to london to shop or seek medical treatment ? -rrb- .
nico , italy the suspension means nothing much except that britain will not interfere in our affairs directly .
we do n't wish to rejoin the club in the future mwana wevhu , zimbabwe this is the least that should be done .
targeted sanctions should be next mb , australia the commonwealth suspension is overdue jmadigane , canada the conduct of the election was a betrayal of the tenet of " one man one vote " that mr mugabe espoused .
the commonwealth suspension is overdue and welcome .
jmadigane , canada too little too late .
it is morally correct but will be completely ineffective .
valerie , usa the commonwealth 's done right .
unfortunately it has come a bit too late .
besides , mugabe does n't care and true to honesty it was merely a question of time because he knew this was coming .
i believe regional leaders could have done more than we 've seen , then this suspension would have been a lot meaningful .
coming at this time , to a lot of people , it 's merely symbolic if not totally without consequence .
potlapotla monagen , botswana finally .
this is not a case of white farmer vs. blacks .
this is a case of a leader knowing he is trouble and playing the race card on a minority group to divert attention from the fact his opponents are also black and his government is corrupt .
also sanctions work .
they freed south africa .
unfortunately many african leaders owe mugabe favours and are reluctant to say anything bad about him .
sidney skinner , barbados one hundred percent correct to suspend zimbabwe .
it 'll be treated with absolute contempt by mugabe but at least it 's a clear message of affirmation for those many zimbabweans who believe in civil liberty and rule of law and a message to those who do n't that their criminal actions are not acceptable .
the suspension alone is nowhere near strong enough but it 's the first glimmer of hope for zimbabwe since the elections .
john hingi , zimbabwean refugee - uk what the commonwealth is doing now should have been done two years ago dan , zimbabwe what the commonwealth is doing now should have been done two years ago and zimbabwe might have seen free and fair presidential and parliament elections .
i do n't think mugabe really cares as long as no one is talking about arresting him and putting him to trial the man will not listen to anything .
dan , zimbabwe i think more should be done to stop mr. mugabe , if it were white farmers attacking blacks there would be an uproar , racism needs stamping out just as swiftly when it 's black on white .
michael , england no though i do n't support robert mugabe .
i do not think it was right it is the zimbabweans who suffer in the long run .
sandy dsue , zimbabwe all the turmoil is concentrated in urban areas where the support for mdc and zanu-pf is tilted towards mdc maybe on a 60-40 split .
in rural areas , all the support is for the present ruling party .
i may not like it and the world may not like it but the zimbabwe rural majority like it .
since there is a one-man-one vote system in zimbabwe , it 's going to take a while for mdc to gain enough popularity .
the commonwealth should not dictate its wishes to the people of zimbabwe .
it is a sad day in london , uk when the commonwealth is trying to make their vote count more than the voice of the zimbabwe people .
jr , usa all we are saying is we wo n't call this farce an election , and wo n't recognise its results paul connor , canada i have little patience for those who claim this suspension is unwarranted " meddling " by rich white ex-imperialists .
they do n't know what meddling is .
all we are saying is we wo n't call this farce an election , and wo n't recognise its results .
zimbabwe 's government can do what it wishes from now on , but few others in the world will bother with them anymore .
how , exactly , does this constitute " interference " ?
hopefully we westerners will have the wit to welcome skilled zimbabweans who likewise abjure mugabe 's kleptocracy .
i just wonder why mugabe would willingly choose to have to watch his back for the rest of his career and life .
i 'll never understand why such " leaders " needlessly multiply enmities among their own people .
ironically , the very concepts of " president " " election " " liberation " and " nation-state " are western .
i do n't see these " anti-imperialists " plumping for " native " alternatives , probably because they 'd be less lucrative .
paul connor , canada suspending zimbabwe is not only the right thing to do but also the only thing to do , as far as the commonwealth is concerned .
i am pleased to see that presidents mbeki and obasanjo backed the suspension .
it is about time that african presidents start looking out for the african people and not the african dictators such as mugabe .
nsengimana nsengimana , usa how can people say the commonwealth is " a forum of africa 's colonial masters and still represents the interest of imperialism " when two of the three leaders making today 's decision were african ?
yes the commonwealth was right - i definitely think it 's about time a joint international statement of condemnation is made against mugabe 's dictatorship .
unfortunately i agree with others that it will probably have little impact on mugabe himself , and for the rest of zimbabwe i pray .
karen , uk this is a wise move , as it will allow zimbabwe and it 's original black countrymen to establish nationhood outside the pretext of commonwealth jee , india this is a wise move , as it will allow zimbabwe and it 's original black countrymen to establish nationhood outside the pretext of commonwealth and most importantly britain and australia .
it should now ask all the supporters and representatives of enemy countries of commonwealth to leave zimbabwe and establish true rhodesian sovereignty .
jee , india what a drop encouragement in a desert of desolation this suspension is !
well done you three .
i know two of you were dragged by your hair screaming to get to this decision but well done all the same .
mugabe should now realise he is a sad excuse for a leader .
if he is sane he will finally notice the only people who can rescue from his phantom fight with blair are zimbabweans .
look after us and may be we will let you go along with your delusions .
whatever happened to one man one vote s. lunga , zimbabwean in uk has any thought been given as to where the rulers of these african states would be if the colonialist had not gone there in the first place ?
mb , canada the right thing has been done william b clarke , uk the commonwealth represents freedom , democracy and civility - mugabe has breached this , and to tolerate it would be as good as condemning his behaviour .
the right thing has been done .
william b clarke , uk the commonwealth played straight into mugabe 's hands again .
free food , thrown out of a commonwealth he hates anyway , and most zimbabweans have never been told what democracy or the commonwealth really are to start with .
doug macrae , south africa the violence in zimbabwe is deplorable .
punitive action needs to be taken directed towards mugabe and his cronies with minimal suffering for innocent zimbabwean people .
for a change the west seems to be taking positive action in helping zimbabwe , this should be applauded .
i 'm worried , though , by the fact that the western media highlights the suffering of white people in zimbabwe more than that of blacks .
we hear of white farmers dying in headlines while the killing of blacks is in small print , if at all mentioned .
ndumi , uk hurray !
not sure that it will have any effect on mugabe , but at least the world is making a stand .
perhaps the beginning of the end for mugabe .
ah , zimbabwean in uk it 's about time the international community did something useful peter james , zimbabwe it 's about time the international community did something useful .
it 's taken a long long time .
if it had been a white person in power , and he was murdering innocent people the world would of acted very quickly .
it seems that everyone is a bit scared of mugabe .
peter james , zimbabwe the commonwealth 's commitment to democracy is now in no doubt , neither is sa 's , nigeria 's or australia 's .
so far so good .
next step would be for sa to do some vigorous arm-twisting to get rgm to retire as soon as possible .
only then , perhaps , could there be a government of national unity with even a ghost of a chance of doing some good .
bill , usa absolutely , they were so right to suspend zimbabwe from the commonwealth , this should have been done sooner though .
they also need to decide what next step they are going to take as this can not go on , white farmers -lrb- not that it matters what colour they are -rrb- being killed because they are on african land , these white farmers have been there for generations like our blacks , asians etc have been here for generations and the uk is their country as much as it is ours , we can not let this go on as it will spread into the other african countries .
it is a pity that we can not work together as all of our blood is the same colour it does not matter what colour skin we have michelle , united kingdom it has sent a stern warning that the commonwealth means business when it claims that it promotes and upholds values of democracy cyprian kambili , malawian in uk the commonwealth has been right in suspending zimbabwe for a year - the decision is akin to an indictment with a strong unless and until zimbabwe government complies with the commonwealth harare principles it will face isolation and international reproach .
it has also sent a stern warning that the commonwealth means business when it claims that it promotes and upholds values of democracy .
any other decision in the light of the election fiasco in zimbabwe would have been welcoming anarchy into the commonwealth .
it would also have seriously and perhaps irretrievably have undermined the position and even perhaps the existence of commonwealth in the 21st century .
cyprian kambili , malawian in uk are zimbabweans not entitled to the same protection from the commonwealth that was given to the people of fiji ?
is democracy only one colour or for all colours ?
folks please stop patronizing zimbabweans .
we are suffering under an illegal regime that stole our sovereignty .
our voice must be heard .
our candidate must rule .
mugabe must go and the appeasement of his regime that has allowed him to remain in power over the last two years must stop .
jeqe , zimbabwean in uk its a good idea to officially blackball mugabe 's government but will this mean we white farmers will be left to our own devices ?
i hope not .
not after the events from the past few weeks .
a zimbabwean , harare so zimbabwe will not be invited to the games in manchester .
big deal andy sithole , zimbabwean in exile the common what ?
so zimbabwe will not be invited to the games in manchester .
big deal .
other than bruising mugabe 's ego i think it will strengthen his misplaced resolve .
what does a country have to do to be suspended from the united nations ?
i think the zimbabwean authorities are treading on that fine line and that would be effective .
africa and the world do not be fooled .
this is not a matter of black and white nor is it of north or south but a desperate attempt by an aging , yet crafty politician , to cling to power under the guise of righting the wrongs of the past .
we await president tsvangirai to take his rightful place .
andy sithole , zimbabwean in exile this is a welcome development as it sends a clear message to those dictators in africa who were planning similar tactics in the near future .
democracy has won decisively .
towera mchiwuno , denmark i think the commonwealth did the right thing by suspending zimbabwe .
the problem is zimbabwe 's african neighbours do n't and wo n't help because of their natural borders .
they are reliant on zimbabwe .
herein lies the problem .
the fall in economic development par se in the sadc countries has no political clout and that is the real traveristy because it does n't just affect the people in zimbabwe it affects others in zambia and malawi to name a few countries .

the uk 's competition watchdog has warned uk mobile phone operators of a wide-ranging probe into their finances , following concerns of overcharging .
the competition commission has said it is seeking evidence of " excessive profits " reaped by the big four operators - one2one , mmo2 , vodafone and orange .
the investigation follows concerns lodged by telecoms watchdog oftel over levels of termination rates - the fees an operator charges rivals for connecting calls to its network .
but the competition commission has warned that any of the companies ' operations could be open to investigation .
" we shall want to pursue ... whether excessive profits are being earned by any of the operators either overall or in respect of any part of their business , " the commission wrote in a letter to the companies .
price concerns the investigation will cover levels of competition in the text messaging market , one of the most lucrative areas for mobile phone firms , the commission confirmed .
and the commission will investigate whether the mobile phone firms are competing " unfairly " against providers of fixed line services .
in december , when oftel lodged its complaint with the commission , a peak rate national call over british telecom 's network cost 24p .
the same call to a different network cost 60p , of which 39p represented the termination charge .
phone packages offered by operators will also be investigated , to see if fees gained from termination charges are being used to subsidise handset prices , leading to " distorted " pricing structures .
failures in the termination fee market are to be probed for " effects adverse to the public interest in the form of higher charges for consumers " or an " inappropriate price structure across mobile phone services " .
bitter dispute oftel 's warning in december of a competition commission investigation prompted a bitter response from operators , which warned that any attempt to cut charges would threaten investment in the uk mobile market .
" the uk telecommunications market is definitely the most competitive in europe and probably the world , " one2one said in december .
oftel proposed forcing operators to " increase " charges by a rate of no more than inflation minus 12 % for four years .
so if inflation was at , say , 2.0 % , operators would be forced to cut charges by 10.0 % a year .
the commission is due to finish its investigation in june , although a six-month extension can be granted .

adrian poyner , holland the ' frog and peach ' is now open for business in heaven .
thank you for teaching so many of us how to laugh .
stories from the north indeed !
steve m , canada in my opinion dudley moore was foremost a wonderful composer and pianist steve law , england in my opinion dudley moore was foremost a wonderful composer and pianist .
he had a rare gift for communication ; his jazz playing conveyed a spirit , feeling and melodic inspiration worthy of his idol erroll garner .
his outstanding musicianship , for example in his performance of his music from bedazzled at the royal albert hall , left a deep and lasting impression on me .
i will also never forget the feeling of warmth , ease and humanity that he exuded and which i 've not encountered in anyone else i 've met .
it seemed that he was the only person who doubted his greatness , but looking back there really is no doubt .
it was such a cruel end for someone who had so much vitality and talent .
such a great loss .
the memory of dudley moore and peter cook will continue to live on in our hearts .
steve law , england god has some elite members in his family this week , i can just imagine the fun they will eventually have .
god bless you dud for the joy you bought into so many lives .
sleep well .
susie , canada i wish i could 've met dudley or even e-mailed him before he died .
why do we always wait to say " you are absolutely a shining star ! "
i hope his star is shining brightly up above and that he is at peace .
what a truly gifted person .
the world and i will miss him .
rest in peace , dudley .

frances campbell , australia i read what pcp does to a person .

glenn knowles , usa i spoke to my brother on the phone , when i heard the news .
my brother lifted the phone and said , " he 's gone " we loved you to pieces , dud ! !
pook , denmark dudley was super talented and made lots of people laugh linda day , uk dudley was super talented and made lots of people laugh .
he was too young to die and from such a cruel illness .
i feel sad but now glad he 's in a better place .
we will miss him .
linda day , uk he brought so much joy around him .
why him ?
a man like him did n't deserve such a sad end , it 's too bad .
god bless his wonderful soul !
violet , italy dud , in a heightist world you shone through with your brilliance and talent !
we have so few positive short role models and now we have one less .
lauren , wales well done dud for showing the world that short men are just as sexy and able as our taller brothers !
you did a lot to counter height prejudice in our society .
rip steve , england i still remember laughing uncontrollably when i first saw the ' tarzan ' sketch , and the thought of it still gives me the giggles teresa , canada i still remember laughing uncontrollably when i first saw the ' tarzan ' sketch , and the thought of it still gives me the giggles .
god bless , dud and pete and thanks for all the laughs .
teresa , canada dudley , i know how it is to be forced to give up playing music professionally , when the body will no longer do what the muse has stirred within you .
now , may you have that ability restored to you in the eternal hereafter .
i long to join you .
how about practicing the brahms g major violin & piano sonata until i get there ?
pat noonan , usa dudley moore , you shall be missed dearly and remembered fondly .
you are truly in a better place .
thank you for bringing so many of us so much laughter and enjoyment .
donna mae , canada dudley moore will be with all of us who seek laughter and a unique sense of humour daily to break the tensions of a war torn world .
he taught us all how to look and reflect upon the positive .
he has now left the dressing room and entered eterntiy .
god bless dudley moore who gave us such happiness , hope and escape from the ugliness of that around us all .
marjorie dowling , usa i remember discovering " derek and clive live " , listening to it in my bedroom , aged 14 with the volume turned down in case my mother heard it .
" this bloke walked up to me ... " .
i laughed so much my face ached for days .
i miss you pete and dud !
pete , uk an hilarious man who , along with that man cook , taught me that swearing is indeed grown up , clever and funny ... nik , uk i have always treasured that time with him as i have watched his career grow .
diane staniforth , usa i had brunch with dudley moore at the alta mira restaurant in sausalito , ca after the first performance of " beyond the fringe " at the masonic auditorium in san francisco in the late 60 's.in those days , he and peter cook were hardly known in the us .
a group of us -lrb- 22 brits -rrb- watched him from the 2nd row , laughing hilariously throughout the performance .
so moved was i that i called him at his hotel the next day and invited him to join me for a tour of my beloved city .
we spent 4 hours together , during which time he seemed to want to " unload " , and told me in great detail all about his childhood , his fears that his mother " hated him and thought of him as a monster " because of his club-foot , and how he had spent years in therapy dealing with it .
i felt extremely honoured and privileged to be the recipient of this very personal information , and because of the trust he bestowed upon me , a virtual stranger .
i have always treasured that time with him as i have watched his career grow , and his life change in so many ways .
strangely , we hardly laughed at all during that time together , and i felt in some way that he also valued spending time with someone where he did n't have to be " on " .
-lrb- it was only many years later that he revealed to the public at large that he had a club-foot -rrb- .
dudley was a wonderful human being , and i am deeply saddened by his death .
i know he is now at peace , and keeping everyone entertained in heaven .
diane staniforth , usa small bloke . huge talent !
paul rodgers , usa " you see dudley 's are not seaworthy " . you can not float on a dudley . give our regards to saint peter mate .
steve dawson , great britain i yelled " hi " to you amid the throngs at toronto airport , you stuck up your arm loaded with bags & yelled " how are you ! "
what a thrill ! .
your comic genius in the dentist aftermath scene in " 10 " & the apt scene with goldie in " foul play " were classics ! ! !
thank you .
i pray you are at peace now , we will continue to laugh always , at a very creative loving man .
the world will be less without you !
god bless you dudley !
betsy wilson , canada even though mr moore 's passing means a great loss to the world of comedy , we must think of mr moore 's life as a gift .
how often is it that the mere thought of someone can make you break out into uncontrollable fits of laughter ?
his talent was on par with the great peter sellers , and i hope the two are cooking up a storm of laughter in elysium at this moment .
rockne , usa he was modest about his musical talent , and , of course , an hilarious interviewee .
bryan day , ireland being the same height , dud was my role model in my teens in the 60s .
not only but also brought more than that wonderful humour , but was a conduit to jazz through his wonderful piano playing .
ten years ago it was my ambition fulfilled to meet him on a visit to dublin and interview him for my jazz radio show .
he was modest about his musical talent , and , of course , an hilarious interviewee .
at last some of his early jazz lpsare now reissued on cd , so his musical legacy will always be with us .
bryan day , ireland what can i say ...
dudley moore was a genius - i 'll never forget the " derek & clive " tapes - used to listen to them was a student .
you were a great all rounder - we will all miss your unique genius .
john nelson , paris , france .
i had the pleasure of interviewing mr. moore in la for one of his films .
i told him that i was an amateur musician with a love for bach and we spent the rest of the interview talking about his love of bach 's organ works that he had studied and played at oxford .
it was " to heck with this movie business , let 's talk music . "
it was something i 'll always fondly remember .
what a wonderful musician he was !
cliff lenz , usa such a shame that dud - like the irrepressible pete - had such misery in his final years , such a shame the two of them fell out for so long , such a shame the foolish beeb erased so much of their early work .
but lets just remember the tears of absolute joy and hilarity we shared with dud as pete made him crack up yet again - " never go to sea on a bogie " .
we must have a new generation to take the mantle of the moores , cooks and milligans - but where are they ?
robson stroud , england there will only ever be one " patch " , hope santa looks after you now .
rest in peace .
b turner , uk i do n't even know where to begin .
without doubt the funniest , most talented man i 've ever seen .

i just hope you 're playing the piano again upstairs .
and maybe ' philosophising ' with pete .

lesley kempson , toronto , canada one of the funniest , lovable , talented men to grace the earth .
dudley , you will be sadly missed .

no matter what project you did , your genuine talent always shone .
you made me smile and laugh an awful lot .
to have all this and to be a proficient pianist , amazing .
from one piano player to another , you were the tops !
lesley kempson , toronto , canada i had been thinking of you just the night before , wondering how you were doing , then the next morning came the sad news .
you were first on my list of " guests i would invite to dinner " .
thank god we have " gospel truth " , " one legged tarzan " and that " little bit of gauze strategically placed on all the rubens paintings of women " .
from that first mayfair hotel performance of " beyond the fringe " to the chance meeting in the lift on rodeo drive what joy and laughter you gave us through the years .
au revoir sweet man , au revoir .
pamella , u.k. and u.s dudley held a special place in my heart .
he was a man who seemed to grace the darker issues of life with a beautiful sense of humour and irony .
it was always that special mix of fine-tuned wit and occasional drunken idiocy that made him so interesting .
god bless him , i raise a glass .
torben , newcastle , uk dudley , you were a great bloke and i 'm sure i speak for all of england , we 'll miss you and we 'll always remember you .

you 've certainly set a bench mark for others awaiting to embark along your footsteps .
rip my friend .
adrian , singapore probably one of the greatest all-round entertainers of his generation , dudley moore seemed to excel effortlessly at everything he did in front of an audience .
to achieve all that he did , and yet to remain so reticent and down-to-earth made him almost unique .
thanks for all the laughs dud - you were a gentleman in the truest sense of the word .
chris b , england firstly peter cook left us .
then spike milligan .
and now the super dud .
we have lost our best comedy talent .
the u.k.is a now a much darker place .
eric thomas , uk goin ' to miss yer dud .

john armstrong , usa although not a great fan of his acting ability or of the vehicles he chose , my memory of dudley go back to the golden days of ' beyond the fringe ' when he and peter cook had my undergraduate friends and i rolling in the aisles with their wry comments on the human condition .
and what a pianist too .
rip dud , you 'll be sadly missed .

what a tragedy that the bbc trashed those program tapes .
sayer , usa i was first introduced to british humour from dudley moore and peter cook .
the two made me laugh hysterically for days .
it 's sad that his light has been snuffed so early and by something that even he had a problem forgiving because he knew it would take his life anyway .
his sense of humour will be missed .
his sensitivity in the acting realm will be missed , but , even more , dudley will be missed .
sean leitsch , chicago i will most fondly remember dudley moore as " patch " the elf in " santa claus the movie , " amongst other things .
another great person gone from the world .
i hope he will rest in peace .
paul gilbert , london , uk .
what dreadful news .
dud will be impossible to replace .
he was not only a brilliant actor and a naturally funny man , but a first class musician .
lets have a beeb tribute to a great guy .
paul balm , england my sister and i went and saw the dudley moore trio when they toured australia back in the late 70s .
we were n't enthusiasts of jazz - we just wanted to see lovely , cuddly dudley .
the jazz ended up being really great but the show was more than that .
he did some wonderful comedy sketches throughout the show and it was one of the funniest evenings i 've ever spent in a theatre .
how cruel it was then that a man who entertained so many with his music and his humour should be " rewarded " with such a horrible illness .
thank you dudley for some happy memories .
fran , australia i am so sorry to hear arthur is not going to be among us anymore .
anna , poland only yesterday on a flight between ecuador and chile were the immortal words " all that brandy and all those cigars " spoken !

steve m , canada in my opinion dudley moore was foremost a wonderful composer and pianist steve law , england in my opinion dudley moore was foremost a wonderful composer and pianist .
he had a rare gift for communication ; his jazz playing conveyed a spirit , feeling and melodic inspiration worthy of his idol erroll garner .
his outstanding musicianship , for example in his performance of his music from bedazzled at the royal albert hall , left a deep and lasting impression on me .
i will also never forget the feeling of warmth , ease and humanity that he exuded and which i 've not encountered in anyone else i 've met .
it seemed that he was the only person who doubted his greatness , but looking back there really is no doubt .
it was such a cruel end for someone who had so much vitality and talent .
such a great loss .
the memory of dudley moore and peter cook will continue to live on in our hearts .

pat noonan , usa dudley moore , you shall be missed dearly and remembered fondly .
you are truly in a better place .
thank you for bringing so many of us so much laughter and enjoyment .
donna mae , canada dudley moore will be with all of us who seek laughter and a unique sense of humour daily to break the tensions of a war torn world .
he taught us all how to look and reflect upon the positive .
he has now left the dressing room and entered eterntiy .
god bless dudley moore who gave us such happiness , hope and escape from the ugliness of that around us all .
marjorie dowling , usa i remember discovering " derek and clive live " , listening to it in my bedroom , aged 14 with the volume turned down in case my mother heard it .
" this bloke walked up to me ... " .
i laughed so much my face ached for days .
i miss you pete and dud !
pete , uk an hilarious man who , along with that man cook , taught me that swearing is indeed grown up , clever and funny ... nik , uk i have always treasured that time with him as i have watched his career grow .
diane staniforth , usa i had brunch with dudley moore at the alta mira restaurant in sausalito , ca after the first performance of " beyond the fringe " at the masonic auditorium in san francisco in the late 60 's.in those days , he and peter cook were hardly known in the us .
a group of us -lrb- 22 brits -rrb- watched him from the 2nd row , laughing hilariously throughout the performance .
so moved was i that i called him at his hotel the next day and invited him to join me for a tour of my beloved city .
we spent 4 hours together , during which time he seemed to want to " unload " , and told me in great detail all about his childhood , his fears that his mother " hated him and thought of him as a monster " because of his club-foot , and how he had spent years in therapy dealing with it .
i felt extremely honoured and privileged to be the recipient of this very personal information , and because of the trust he bestowed upon me , a virtual stranger .
i have always treasured that time with him as i have watched his career grow , and his life change in so many ways .
strangely , we hardly laughed at all during that time together , and i felt in some way that he also valued spending time with someone where he did n't have to be " on " .
-lrb- it was only many years later that he revealed to the public at large that he had a club-foot -rrb- .
dudley was a wonderful human being , and i am deeply saddened by his death .
i know he is now at peace , and keeping everyone entertained in heaven .
diane staniforth , usa small bloke . huge talent !
paul rodgers , usa " you see dudley 's are not seaworthy " . you can not float on a dudley . give our regards to saint peter mate .
steve dawson , great britain i yelled " hi " to you amid the throngs at toronto airport , you stuck up your arm loaded with bags & yelled " how are you ! "
what a thrill ! .
your comic genius in the dentist aftermath scene in " 10 " & the apt scene with goldie in " foul play " were classics ! ! !
thank you .
i pray you are at peace now , we will continue to laugh always , at a very creative loving man .
the world will be less without you !
god bless you dudley !
betsy wilson , canada even though mr moore 's passing means a great loss to the world of comedy , we must think of mr moore 's life as a gift .
how often is it that the mere thought of someone can make you break out into uncontrollable fits of laughter ?
his talent was on par with the great peter sellers , and i hope the two are cooking up a storm of laughter in elysium at this moment .
rockne , usa he was modest about his musical talent , and , of course , an hilarious interviewee .
bryan day , ireland being the same height , dud was my role model in my teens in the 60s .
not only but also brought more than that wonderful humour , but was a conduit to jazz through his wonderful piano playing .
ten years ago it was my ambition fulfilled to meet him on a visit to dublin and interview him for my jazz radio show .
he was modest about his musical talent , and , of course , an hilarious interviewee .
at last some of his early jazz lpsare now reissued on cd , so his musical legacy will always be with us .
bryan day , ireland what can i say ...
dudley moore was a genius - i 'll never forget the " derek & clive " tapes - used to listen to them was a student .
you were a great all rounder - we will all miss your unique genius .
john nelson , paris , france .
i had the pleasure of interviewing mr. moore in la for one of his films .
i told him that i was an amateur musician with a love for bach and we spent the rest of the interview talking about his love of bach 's organ works that he had studied and played at oxford .
it was " to heck with this movie business , let 's talk music . "
it was something i 'll always fondly remember .
what a wonderful musician he was !
cliff lenz , usa such a shame that dud - like the irrepressible pete - had such misery in his final years , such a shame the two of them fell out for so long , such a shame the foolish beeb erased so much of their early work .
but lets just remember the tears of absolute joy and hilarity we shared with dud as pete made him crack up yet again - " never go to sea on a bogie " .
we must have a new generation to take the mantle of the moores , cooks and milligans - but where are they ?
robson stroud , england there will only ever be one " patch " , hope santa looks after you now .
rest in peace .
b turner , uk i do n't even know where to begin .
without doubt the funniest , most talented man i 've ever seen .

and maybe ' philosophising ' with pete .

no matter what project you did , your genuine talent always shone .
you made me smile and laugh an awful lot .
to have all this and to be a proficient pianist , amazing .
from one piano player to another , you were the tops !
lesley kempson , toronto , canada i had been thinking of you just the night before , wondering how you were doing , then the next morning came the sad news .
you were first on my list of " guests i would invite to dinner " .
thank god we have " gospel truth " , " one legged tarzan " and that " little bit of gauze strategically placed on all the rubens paintings of women " .
from that first mayfair hotel performance of " beyond the fringe " to the chance meeting in the lift on rodeo drive what joy and laughter you gave us through the years .
au revoir sweet man , au revoir .
pamella , u.k. and u.s dudley held a special place in my heart .
he was a man who seemed to grace the darker issues of life with a beautiful sense of humour and irony .
it was always that special mix of fine-tuned wit and occasional drunken idiocy that made him so interesting .
god bless him , i raise a glass .
torben , newcastle , uk dudley , you were a great bloke and i 'm sure i speak for all of england , we 'll miss you and we 'll always remember you .

kym , australia dearest dud , at an early age i 've always marvelled at your musical and acting attributes .
you 've certainly set a bench mark for others awaiting to embark along your footsteps .
rip my friend .
adrian , singapore probably one of the greatest all-round entertainers of his generation , dudley moore seemed to excel effortlessly at everything he did in front of an audience .
to achieve all that he did , and yet to remain so reticent and down-to-earth made him almost unique .
thanks for all the laughs dud - you were a gentleman in the truest sense of the word .
chris b , england firstly peter cook left us .
then spike milligan .

we have lost our best comedy talent .
the u.k.is a now a much darker place .

john armstrong , usa although not a great fan of his acting ability or of the vehicles he chose , my memory of dudley go back to the golden days of ' beyond the fringe ' when he and peter cook had my undergraduate friends and i rolling in the aisles with their wry comments on the human condition .

rip dud , you 'll be sadly missed .
alan thompson , canada i was first introduced to british humour from dudley moore and peter coo sean leitsch , chicago thanks dud .

what a tragedy that the bbc trashed those program tapes .
sayer , usa i was first introduced to british humour from dudley moore and peter cook .
the two made me laugh hysterically for days .
it 's sad that his light has been snuffed so early and by something that even he had a problem forgiving because he knew it would take his life anyway .
his sense of humour will be missed .
his sensitivity in the acting realm will be missed , but , even more , dudley will be missed .
sean leitsch , chicago i will most fondly remember dudley moore as " patch " the elf in " santa claus the movie , " amongst other things .
another great person gone from the world .
i hope he will rest in peace .
paul gilbert , london , uk .
what dreadful news .
dud will be impossible to replace .
he was not only a brilliant actor and a naturally funny man , but a first class musician .
lets have a beeb tribute to a great guy .
paul balm , england my sister and i went and saw the dudley moore trio when they toured australia back in the late 70s .
we were n't enthusiasts of jazz - we just wanted to see lovely , cuddly dudley .
the jazz ended up being really great but the show was more than that .
he did some wonderful comedy sketches throughout the show and it was one of the funniest evenings i 've ever spent in a theatre .
how cruel it was then that a man who entertained so many with his music and his humour should be " rewarded " with such a horrible illness .
thank you dudley for some happy memories .
fran , australia i am so sorry to hear arthur is not going to be among us anymore .

steve m , canada " in my opinion dudley moore was foremost a wonderful composer and pianist " steve law , england in my opinion dudley moore was foremost a wonderful composer and pianist .
he had a rare gift for communication ; his jazz playing conveyed a spirit , feeling and melodic inspiration worthy of his idol erroll garner .
his outstanding musicianship , for example in his performance of his music from bedazzled at the royal albert hall , left a deep and lasting impression on me .
i will also never forget the feeling of warmth , ease and humanity that he exuded and which i 've not encountered in anyone else i 've met .
it seemed that he was the only person who doubted his greatness , but looking back there really is no doubt .
it was such a cruel end for someone who had so much vitality and talent .
such a great loss .
the memory of dudley moore and peter cook will continue to live on in our hearts .
steve law , england god has some elite members in his family this week , i can just imagine the fun they will eventually have .

pete , uk an hilarious man who , along with that man cook , taught me that swearing is indeed grown up , clever and funny ... nik , uk " i have always treasured that time with him as i have watched his career grow . "
diane staniforth , usa i had brunch with dudley moore at the alta mira restaurant in sausalito , ca after the first performance of " beyond the fringe " at the masonic auditorium in san francisco in the late 60 's.in those days , he and peter cook were hardly known in the us .
a group of us -lrb- 22 brits -rrb- watched him from the 2nd row , laughing hilariously throughout the performance .
so moved was i that i called him at his hotel the next day and invited him to join me for a tour of my beloved city .
we spent 4 hours together , during which time he seemed to want to " unload " , and told me in great detail all about his childhood , his fears that his mother " hated him and thought of him as a monster " because of his club-foot , and how he had spent years in therapy dealing with it .
i felt extremely honoured and privileged to be the recipient of this very personal information , and because of the trust he bestowed upon me , a virtual stranger .
i have always treasured that time with him as i have watched his career grow , and his life change in so many ways .
strangely , we hardly laughed at all during that time together , and i felt in some way that he also valued spending time with someone where he did n't have to be " on " .
-lrb- it was only many years later that he revealed to the public at large that he had a club-foot -rrb- .
dudley was a wonderful human being , and i am deeply saddened by his death .
i know he is now at peace , and keeping everyone entertained in heaven .
diane staniforth , usa small bloke . huge talent !
paul rodgers , usa " you see dudley 's are not seaworthy " . you can not float on a dudley . give our regards to saint peter mate .
steve dawson , great britain i yelled " hi " to you amid the throngs at toronto airport , you stuck up your arm loaded with bags & yelled " how are you ! "
what a thrill ! .
your comic genius in the dentist aftermath scene in " 10 " & the apt scene with goldie in " foul play " were classics ! ! !
thank you .
i pray you are at peace now , we will continue to laugh always , at a very creative loving man .
the world will be less without you !
god bless you dudley !
betsy wilson , canada even though mr moore 's passing means a great loss to the world of comedy , we must think of mr moore 's life as a gift .
how often is it that the mere thought of someone can make you break out into uncontrollable fits of laughter ?
his talent was on par with the great peter sellers , and i hope the two are cooking up a storm of laughter in elysium at this moment .
rockne , usa " he was modest about his musical talent , and , of course , an hilarious interviewee . "
bryan day , ireland being the same height , dud was my role model in my teens in the 60s .
not only but also brought more than that wonderful humour , but was a conduit to jazz through his wonderful piano playing .
ten years ago it was my ambition fulfilled to meet him on a visit to dublin and interview him for my jazz radio show .
he was modest about his musical talent , and , of course , an hilarious interviewee .
at last some of his early jazz lpsare now reissued on cd , so his musical legacy will always be with us .
bryan day , ireland what can i say ...
dudley moore was a genius - i 'll never forget the " derek & clive " tapes - used to listen to them was a student .
you were a great all rounder - we will all miss your unique genius .
john nelson , paris , france .
i had the pleasure of interviewing mr. moore in la for one of his films .
i told him that i was an amateur musician with a love for bach and we spent the rest of the interview talking about his love of bach 's organ works that he had studied and played at oxford .
it was " to heck with this movie business , let 's talk music . "
it was something i 'll always fondly remember .
what a wonderful musician he was !
cliff lenz , usa such a shame that dud - like the irrepressible pete - had such misery in his final years , such a shame the two of them fell out for so long , such a shame the foolish beeb erased so much of their early work .
but lets just remember the tears of absolute joy and hilarity we shared with dud as pete made him crack up yet again - " never go to sea on a bogie " .
we must have a new generation to take the mantle of the moores , cooks and milligans - but where are they ?
robson stroud , england there will only ever be one " patch " , hope santa looks after you now .
rest in peace .
b turner , uk i do n't even know where to begin .
without doubt the funniest , most talented man i 've ever seen .

and maybe ' philosophising ' with pete .

lesley kempson , toronto , canada one of the funniest , lovable , talented men to grace the earth .

you made me smile and laugh an awful lot .
to have all this and to be a proficient pianist , amazing .
from one piano player to another , you were the tops !
lesley kempson , toronto , canada i had been thinking of you just the night before , wondering how you were doing , then the next morning came the sad news .
you were first on my list of " guests i would invite to dinner " .
thank god we have " gospel truth " , " one legged tarzan " and that " little bit of gauze strategically placed on all the rubens paintings of women " .
from that first mayfair hotel performance of " beyond the fringe " to the chance meeting in the lift on rodeo drive what joy and laughter you gave us through the years .
au revoir sweet man , au revoir .
pamella , u.k. and u.s dudley held a special place in my heart .
he was a man who seemed to grace the darker issues of life with a beautiful sense of humour and irony .
it was always that special mix of fine-tuned wit and occasional drunken idiocy that made him so interesting .
god bless him , i raise a glass .
torben , newcastle , uk dudley , you were a great bloke and i 'm sure i speak for all of england , we 'll miss you and we 'll always remember you .

you 've certainly set a bench mark for others awaiting to embark along your footsteps .
rip my friend .
adrian , singapore probably one of the greatest all-round entertainers of his generation , dudley moore seemed to excel effortlessly at everything he did in front of an audience .
to achieve all that he did , and yet to remain so reticent and down-to-earth made him almost unique .
thanks for all the laughs dud - you were a gentleman in the truest sense of the word .
chris b , england firstly peter cook left us .
then spike milligan .
and now the super dud .
we have lost our best comedy talent .
the u.k.is a now a much darker place .
eric thomas , uk goin ' to miss yer dud .

john armstrong , usa although not a great fan of his acting ability or of the vehicles he chose , my memory of dudley go back to the golden days of ' beyond the fringe ' when he and peter cook had my undergraduate friends and i rolling in the aisles with their wry comments on the human condition .
and what a pianist too .
rip dud , you 'll be sadly missed .

what a tragedy that the bbc trashed those program tapes .
sayer , usa i was first introduced to british humour from dudley moore and peter cook .
the two made me laugh hysterically for days .

his sense of humour will be missed .
his sensitivity in the acting realm will be missed , but , even more , dudley will be missed .
sean leitsch , chicago i will most fondly remember dudley moore as " patch " the elf in " santa claus the movie , " amongst other things .

paul gilbert , london , uk .
what dreadful news .
dud will be impossible to replace .
he was not only a brilliant actor and a naturally funny man , but a first class musician .
lets have a beeb tribute to a great guy .
paul balm , england my sister and i went and saw the dudley moore trio when they toured australia back in the late 70s .
we were n't enthusiasts of jazz - we just wanted to see lovely , cuddly dudley .
the jazz ended up being really great but the show was more than that .
he did some wonderful comedy sketches throughout the show and it was one of the funniest evenings i 've ever spent in a theatre .
how cruel it was then that a man who entertained so many with his music and his humour should be " rewarded " with such a horrible illness .
thank you dudley for some happy memories .
fran , australia i am so sorry to hear arthur is not going to be among us anymore .

bolivia is south america 's poorest and least developed country .
it also has the region 's most open economy .
the government is campaigning for other nations to follow bolivia 's economic liberalisation .
but many companies are more concerned that bolivia improves its ability to protect the nation 's industries by controlling its borders .
" in bolivia we have opened our economy , but we have n't seen reciprocity in the developed world or from our neighbours , " said president jorge quiroga in a speech at un headquarters in new york .
coca-cocaine was worth $ 1bn to the bolivian economy " we have eliminated nearly all production of cocaine , an export product that , as destructive as it was , did not face subsidies , barriers or tariffs . "
" now we require access to markets , to guarantee that our citizens ' willingness to exchange illicit activities for legitimate ones is not frustrated . "
join the line but as bolivia goes knocking on the door of the us trade secretary to ask for greater market access , they find themselves standing in a long queue of nations that also feel the us owes them something .
" there is a huge clamour by countries who are our allies just like bolivia , that want access to the us market , " commented a us diplomat in la paz who declined to be named .
the diplomat explained that it is unlikely bolivia will be given bilateral treatment by the us , stating that , " our main focus is to have free trade for the entire hemisphere by 2005 . "
so for now the country that has done most to combat the drug trade must settle for the market access also enjoyed by peru , ecuador , columbia and venezuela under the andean pact trade agreement -lrb- apta -rrb- .
bolivia 's minister of foreign trade and investment , claudio mansilla , believes that this reflects the fact that future trade negotiations are better approached as part of a regional body .
" we need to strengthen regional integration to allow us to negotiate -lsb- trade deals -rsb- with greater strength , " he said .
lost opportunity but some commentators believe that bolivia missed their best chance to negotiate market access one-to-one with the us before they began their coca eradication programme in 1997 .
the quantities -lrb- of wine -rrb- being smuggled are bigger than the quantity produced locally ...
by doing nothing the government is turning its backs on 20,000 families sergio prudencio , la concepcion winery " bolivia was very dependent on the informal economy of coca-cocaine , it is estimated that eradication has taken $ 1bn each year out of the country , " said roberto mustafá president of the national chamber of industry .
" they negotiated badly .
they eradicated the coca in exchange for nothing . "
there is also criticism that bolivia , in trying to advance regional economic integration , has opened a void for certain industry sectors to fall into .
five years ago bolivia signed an agreement to develop closer ties with the mercosur counties -lrb- argentina , chile , paraguay , uruguay and brazil -rrb- .
as part of that agreement they reduced tariffs on the import of flour making them equal to those on the import of wheat .
since then argentine flour producers have taken half the bolivian market while the national industry has fallen into decline .
" we are giving work to the argentine industry , " said arturo montero , vice-president of one producer molino andino .
" in august it will be five years since this tariff change was introduced and in that time 14 of the 20 flour producers in bolivia have gone bust . "
informal economy the problems producers have competing with legal imports are only compounded by the flow of products that cross bolivia 's 4000 miles of porous borders as contraband .
" the difference in costs for a bolivian company and products entering through the informal economy is 34 % , -lrb- sales tax , tariffs etc -rrb- , " said nemecio larrea , general manager of food producer venado .
" the social cost of this lack of control is greater unemployment in bolivia . "
larrea 's concerns are shared by wine producers in the south of the country , who have in recent months seen huge quantities of cartoned wine crossing the border from argentina .
" the quantities being smuggled are bigger than the quantity produced locally , " said sergio prudencio , head of the la concepción winery .
" by doing nothing the government is turning its backs on 20,000 families that produce grapes and wine for the industry . "
chilean example clearly there is a lot to be done in terms of regulation and border controls if bolivian industry is to be allowed to develop in a secure environment .
some believe the country only has to look across the border into chile to see the way forward .
" chile has been able to balance a liberal trade policy with interventions by the state , " explained economic analyst napoleon pacheco .
" for example , it is free to import coffee grains but not a finished product like nescafe , because they make nescafe in chile .
it is an intelligent policy that promotes the national manufacturing base . "
bolivian industry , much of which is running at less than 60 % of capacity , will be hoping the state acts swiftly to support them .
the consequence of the government continuing its hands-off approach could be that in a future regional free market bolivian industry simply wo n't be able to compete .

" chile has been able to balance a liberal trade policy with interventions by the state , " explained economic analyst napoleon pacheco .
" for example , it is free to import coffee grains but not a finished product like nescafe , because they make nescafe in chile .
it is an intelligent policy that promotes the national manufacturing base . "
bolivian industry , much of which is running at less than 60 % of capacity , will be hoping the state acts swiftly to support them .
the consequence of the government continuing its hands-off approach could be that in a future regional free market bolivian industry simply wo n't be able to compete .

read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction billy wilder 's death is the death of a generation of comedy earl , usa billy wilder 's death is the death of a generation of comedy .
his subject matter was never comedy to poke fun at how unhip a character was or how unappealing they were .
he merely invites us along in these people 's fictional lives and allows us to laugh when we feel like it .
i laughed so hard and frequently watching " one two three " that my stomach muscles hurt afterwards .
thank you mr. wilder for making people laugh .
it 's a talent that is too frequently overlooked .
earl , usa i have a collection of his movies .
i would pick " some like it hot " .
brilliant .
he will be missed .
gary hunt , england what a great writer and director .
he made some of the best movies ever .
he 'll be missed by all .
jason & jakob lundy , usa not only did mr. wilder write and film masterpieces in their own genre but he was an unassuming , humble man .
art in general , and not only cinema , has lost a true genius .
god bless him jaime gelabert , usa even a mediocre wilder film is a classic compared to today 's cinema lori hoffman , usa even a mediocre wilder film is a classic compared to today 's cinema .
everybody knows the lines from some like it hot , and the apartment , but my favourite billy wilder line comes from my favourite billy wilder film : " i 've heard of hard-boiled , but you 're 20 minutes . "
the movie is ace in the hole -lrb- aka the big carnival -rrb- , easily the most cynical look at the newspaper business ever put to celluloid .
this will be the movie i watch in tribute .
lori hoffman , usa a great writer and director - ' some like it hot ' is one of the greatest comedies ever made !
norman reynolds , uk i 've seen many examples of hollywood 's entertainment product .
" the apartment " remains my favourite , but several of the others -lrb- e.g.
" witness for the prosecution " & " some like it hot " -rrb- come very close .
gerald j. pass , usa billy wilder is what made me love movies , what sent me to film school , and remains the preposterously high standard i judge every other film by .
my deepest thanks .
diana , usa although " nobody 's perfect " , billy wilder 's films usually were .
i will miss you , maestro .
petr k. , prague , czechia without your vision , imagination and hard work , we would have missed so much !
thank you billy !
barbara l. , america for a man who could n't speak a word of english to write and direct some of the greatest films of all time is a wonderful thing renate samson , england for a man who could n't speak a word of english to write and direct some of the greatest films of all time is a wonderful thing .
i thank him for so many great moments and i along with many others will miss him enormously .
renate samson , england today 's films are insulting to the intellect and to the imagination .
wilder 's films will be remembered long after the rubbish produced by the current generation is forgotten .
glenn knowles , usa " double indemnity " and " the apartment " were the only reason i respected and stayed interested in , black and white movies .
a shame , but his movies will live on for him .
ken , uk i feel sorry to learning the sad news .
he was such a great movie man in all respects .
i thank him for giving so much spiritual pleasure to so many moviegoers .
here is another example of so many in the world owe so much to just one man .
i hope i can see some of his pictures again .
pn cheng , hong kong let 's not forget wilder 's credit for ninotchka , the superb comedy that not only amused millions but also captured the essence of the east vs. west issue miodrag , serbia let 's not forget wilder 's credit for ninotchka , the superb comedy that not only amused millions but also captured the essence of the east vs. west issue .
way back in 1939 -lrb- ! -rrb- the film said it all about capitalism vs. communism and no high-brow debate among politicians , philosophers and others , before or after , could add much to what was so elegantly sublimed in ninotchka .
the film predicted the outcome of the cold war before it officially began .
miodrag , serbia i 've had many contacts with austrians over the years and find that they are very worldly .
wilder was typically austrian and his worldliness and ingrained sophistication are what gave the films he directed their fibber , their durability .
perhaps the globalisation of cultures wo n't give us another wilder and that i accept .
what worries me is that future generations may not appreciate his work .
nora rotussney , usa two of the best films i have ever seen were ' some like it hot ' and ' the apartment ' that were directed by billy .
those of you who have n't seen them - you must as a tribute to billy wilder .
thank you , billy .
emma reilly , england cinema has lost one of its irreplaceable masters lara petrossians , uk i was once assigned to translate a two-and-a-half hour tv programme on wilder which showed the man in action .
it was interesting to see how he worked with actors and actresses such as marilyn monroe , who could be very difficult at times , and how meticulously he worked on screenplays etc .
i enjoyed every second of it and thought that truly was a cinema course for me .
his films are so genuine , engaging and unpretentious .
i just love watching " some like it hot " over and over again .
so sad that cinema has lost one of its irreplaceable masters .
lara petrossians , uk worth being alive just to laugh at " some like it hot " .
gilbert white , london , uk " some like it hot " & " double indemnity " were special to me .
may you rest now in a far better place than this .
billy wilder you will be remembered always , as one of the greats , you will be missed very much .
foxylady , billy wilder was a true master of his medium and i look forward to many many more years of entertainment through his remarkable body of work susan , edinburgh over a year ago my brother and i happened across sunset boulevard on bb2 and were instantly engrossed .
we spent that afternoon spontaneously and wonderfully entertained by a masterful piece of filmmaking .
billy wilder was a true master of his medium and i look forward to many many more years of entertainment through his remarkable body of work .
thank you mr wilder .
susan , edinburgh i was working in a theatre when " some like it hot " was released .
i watched it 4 or 5 times in a row ... i could n't stop laughing .
i almost had to throw myself out !
bob brunner , usa he gave the world " some like it hot " .
what better example is there of his genius ?
he will always be remembered through his work , but particularly in this legendary example of film comedy .
lou , uk " stalag 17 " is standing the test of time .
it 's still one of the best !
thanks mr. wilder jim , united states he came to the u.s. when he was almost 30 speaking almost no english and within a few years was writing some of the wittiest scripts of all time .
some of his best films are some of his less well-known : ace in the hole , one two three -lrb- my personal favorite wilder film -rrb- , kiss me stupid , the private life of sherlock holmes , avanti ! .
unfortunately , hollywood no longer believes in wit and it 's unlikely a talent like wilder 's will come our way again .
jose p. , mexico in this sad age of cookie cutter cinema , his literate and witty approach to filmmaking will be sorely missed .
robert del valle , usa he directed the greatest example of film noir , double indemnity , and , 15 years later , the greatest comedy , some like it hot nick gledhill , united kingdom he was arguably the greatest screenwriter .
mitch , usa one of the two or three greatest directors to ever work in the hollywood studio system , he was arguably the greatest screenwriter .
when i look at hollywood today and watch what is supposed to be the cream of the crop -lrb- " a beautiful mind , " " gladiator " -rrb- , it makes wilder 's passing even sadder .
we need people with wilder 's talents more than ever .
mitch , usa mr wilder is a wonderful and very caring man .
i worked with him for 2 and a half years as his personal help .
he taught me a lot in life -lrb- especially when he told me the mind of the genius is always advanced , not only seeing what ¿ s before you but also beyond that -rrb- .
he loves to read he is a diligent student of current events , he knows what is happening in zimbabwe or in other parts of the world that need to be read about .
he told me one time if you want to succeed in life work hard , study and be an admirer of arts and classic music , he likes to sing volare and the works of mozart -lrb- since they came from the same country -rrb- .
i 'm gonna miss him , he 's the best for me ... bye , mr wilder , i wont forget you . rekz , usa i have seen " some like it hot " probably 50 times , and i still laugh .
if a funnier movie was ever made , i have n't seen it .
robert , usa i ca n't think of any other director who has left such a rich legacy .
marten king , usa i was introduced to billy 's films by a german friend , whose personal favourite was " some like it hot . "
i have since watched a number of his movies .
i ca n't think of any other director who has left such a rich legacy .
i have never seen one i did n't like .
thanks billy !
marten king , usa the best director comedy-wise , drama-wise , and otherwise-wise kevin rutherford , poland i paid no attention to who directed the film until i saw billy wilder 's films .
even now , i ca n't come up with anything more than clichéd phrases that do n't measure up to his excellence .
he was an extraordinary master of a uniquely difficult medium , a great artist and storyteller .
laure paquette , canada i feel a loss with the death of mr. wilder as a young filmmaker .
" double indemnity " is one film i have returned to and pondered many times as i have tried to work out important questions in my own work .
may you rest in peace and thank you for the body of work you left behind .
kael moffat , oklahoma , usa the king is dead .
simply the greatest there ever was .
gadsby , london / los angeles he was a scientist , so to speak , because he shot films like experiments , and he told us those things than nobody saw and then he changed the world .
juan carlos fauvety , argentina the world is a sad place today .
i ca n't imagine what my life would have been like without billy wilder 's films .
i have cried with them and laughed with them .
wilder 's genius made me the person i am today .
lesley kempson , toronto , canada yes , he died , but his work will always keep him alive dipen , nepal this brilliant man found a way to fit sophisticated viennese humour into a hollywood mould - an amazing achievement. it up !
abu amaal , us a truly remarkable man who will forever leave his mark on the world of cinema .
his movies have stood the test of time , and still seem sharp and relevant to this day .
pete clarke , uk great films - unique and forever memorable .
the golden age of film is now past .
george , australia billy wilder was one the greatest writers / directors in cinema history .
he leaves behind him a legacy of superb films , each made with great style , wit , invention , and a healthy dose of cynicism .
he truly was a one off and will be sorely missed .
frazer , england the only director who really understood marilyn monroe and recognised her true talent - and so he secured her finest performances .
bill bemister , oxford , england a class act .
we 'll never see the likes of his genius again .
all of his films are treasured moments .
seena , usa i have seen " some like it hot " probably 50 times , and i still laugh .
if a funnier movie was ever made , i have n't seen it .
robert , usa his body of work will show film viewers yet to be born how it was done in the 20th century .
john , chicago i love the ' minor ' classics like sabrina and love in the afternoon - it 's so nice to be able to watch a film all the way through with a smile on your face .
nicky leech , england if only for the scene in the apartment where fred macmurray wheedles the key away from jack lemmon , mr wilder will always be remembered .
g.collinge , canada his death as well as dudley moore 's has made this week a sad week in media industry .
kiaha , usa one of the greats - certainly the greatest of the ' 50s film-makers .
his movies were funny , poignant , and provocative in a time when most films only needed one adjective to describe them .
thank you !
anna stevens , usa yes , he died but his work will always keep him alive dipen , nepal an amazing talent .
his body of work will show film viewers yet to be born how it was done in the 20th century .
john , chicago , usa wilder gone .
lennon gone .
kubrick gone .
milligan gone .
ron howard and russell crowe still here !
there is no justice .
walter sheldrake , england recently , i watched " the apartment " after not seeing it for many years .
it is still brilliant , and reflects both the humour and the sensitivity of billy wilder .
he was an original .
gary , japan no other director today can even compare .
from the intriguing sunset boulevard to the sobering lost weekend , billy has given us countless hours of enjoyment through his genius filmmaking .
i wished that more directors today would learn from him .
angeline calvin , california usa thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
you truly epitomize what being an american is all about ; starting a new life , escaping from past turmoil or oppression and being the best at what you do .
rest in peace .
mike , usa billy wilder 's gift to me was sabrina .
that movie took me to paris and later inspired my daughter at 15 to perfect chocolate souffle !
he was the master of his craft .
jeannette vidgen , usa simply , the best .
philip collins , usa i first saw billy wilder 's " one two three " on bbc-tv while stationed in the us air force in england about 30 years ago .
i could n't stop laughing during the entire film .
what made it tough was that there were no breaks for adverts so i could go to the loo !
g. j. schober , new york i ca n't think of many directors who created so many bona fide classics in so many different genres .
he will be missed salim adam , united kingdom the apartment , some like it hot , sunset boulevard , double indemnity , stalag 17 - to have made just one of these films would rank any director among the greats kevin rogers , uk no director made such a high proportion of quality films .
sunset boulevard was his greatest but " lesser " ones such as ace in the hole only serve to underline his depth .
the film industry , and the world , has truly lost a giant today .
charles , uk i interviewed him once , about twenty years ago , for a film we were making about the denazification of postwar germany .
he made extremely vivid , very wilder-ish films for the german public , to tell them about the crueller aspects of the nazis and of which they knew , or professed to know , very little .
the short documentary films he made during that brief period in germany may not have been entertaining , but they had an effect for good that was every bit as profound as his more famous feature films of later years .
he was an exceptional talent , the like of whom we will not see again for a very long while .
simon w. , massachusetts , usa no-one today comes close , a truly unique writer / director , funny , scathing , humane , joyful , he had it all and did it better than anyone .
plus he survived 2 movies with marilyn !
stuart marshall , uk the apartment , some like it hot , sunset boulevard , double indemnity , stalag 17 - to have made just one of these films would rank any director among the greats .
however , wilder made them all , and many more , and surely this great legacy of some of the greatest writing direction will be his claim to greatness , like kubrick .
my favourite is the apartment as it was so ahead of its time and because it 's a super , little film .
kevin rogers , uk i recall watching his movie " one , two , three " as a kid and laughing hysterically , i still do when i see it .
he was a unique talent and personality who thankfully escaped the holocaust.the drab and grey money people now direct the films themselves and it shows ; all the gold can never create natural born beings like billy wilder .
dankeschoen billy for all the wonderful good laughs .
kevin , usa one of the smartest people to ever direct and one of the funniest .
it was a dream of mine to meet him someday , and now i 'll have to settle for his great films .
james hudnall , las vegas , usa lamenting the death of another legendary talent .
some like it hot is the greatest film ever made !
ruth allen , scotland i just loved the apartment .
it 's such a lonesome , fun and extremely exciting story .
we can see there people that are quite normal , but everything is displayed with so much simplicity and honesty .

the film industry , and the world , has truly lost a giant today .
charles , uk i interviewed him once , about twenty years ago , for a film we were making about the denazification of postwar germany .
he made extremely vivid , very wilder-ish films for the german public , to tell them about the crueller aspects of the nazis and of which they knew , or professed to know , very little .
the short documentary films he made during that brief period in germany may not have been entertaining , but they had an effect for good that was every bit as profound as his more famous feature films of later years .
he was an exceptional talent , the like of whom we will not see again for a very long while .

plus he survived 2 movies with marilyn !
stuart marshall , uk the apartment , some like it hot , sunset boulevard , double indemnity , stalag 17 - to have made just one of these films would rank any director among the greats .
however , wilder made them all , and many more , and surely this great legacy of some of the greatest writing direction will be his claim to greatness , like kubrick .
my favourite is the apartment as it was so ahead of its time and because it 's a super , little film .
kevin rogers , uk i recall watching his movie " one , two , three " as a kid and laughing hysterically , i still do when i see it .
he was a unique talent and personality who thankfully escaped the holocaust.the drab and grey money people now direct the films themselves and it shows ; all the gold can never create natural born beings like billy wilder .
dankeschoen billy for all the wonderful good laughs .
kevin , usa one of the smartest people to ever direct and one of the funniest .
