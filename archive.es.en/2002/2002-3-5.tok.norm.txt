charles was surrounded by a throng of well-wishers as he toured the cantagalo " favela " shortly after dark on monday evening .
but he was also surrounded by a tight ring of security guards , following a shoot-out on sunday night in which police killed a suspected drug trafficker from the area and sparked a mini-riot .
one local housewife managed to squeeze through the prince 's cordon to give him a kiss on the cheek .
cantagalo used to be run by drug traffickers and was a no-go area for city police .
police killings but the brazilians were keen for charles to see how british funding has helped turn the area around .
prince charles was given a fluminense football shirt during the 45-minute tour of the area , charles visited the viva rio charity centre .
the programme receives funding from the british foreign office .
it is aimed at boosting social and education amenities for children , and also has a community policing programme .
it was created in 1993 amid outrage over police killings of street children and is credited with transforming relations between the police and residents .
luke dowdney , 29 , a briton working for the charity , said : " seven people died at the hands of police before we came , and since we set up the community police programme , there have been no murders . "
dengue fever officers now openly patrol in cantagalo , which until recently they would only enter when heavily armed .
" it is important to understand that this is the first time in the history of rio that police have had a constant presence in an area such as this , " said mr dowdney .
" the prince 's visit is of fundamental importance because it puts a focus on the project and increases the chances of it being replicated across the city .
" it is changing the face of policing in rio . "
the rio authorities also sent a lorry-load of insect repellent ahead of the prince to spray the streets to rid them of mosquitoes .
an epidemic of the potentially fatal , mosquito-borne dengue fever disease is currently sweeping rio and has so far killed dozens of people , with 40,000 more suffering from a less serious strain .

mr mubarak is one of america 's key allies in the region - egypt will soon overtake israel in the amount of us military aid it receives .
he is also a close confidant of palestinian leader yasser arafat .
in theory , he should be the ideal intermediary to bring down the violence .
yet the situation between israel and the palestinians is so dark that no-one is expecting any breakthroughs .
the egyptian leader brings his own peace proposal .
president mubarak 's suggestion is that he should host a summit between the israeli and palestinian leaders at the egyptian resort of sharm el-sheikh .
mr mubarak first put the idea forward in a telephone call with the israeli prime minister , ariel sharon , around a week ago .
now he is trying it out in washington .
" we are not going to solve all the problems in one minute , " said mr mubarak .
but he insisted the idea could " change the atmosphere ... show the people that both are sitting together . "
it is , literally , a media offensive .
the egyptian idea was first aired publicly on the us cable news channel cnn .
it is clearly a response to the saudi peace proposals first suggested to the new york times columnist tom friedman .
peace plans under the saudi ideas , arab states would recognise the state of israel if israel withdraws to its 1967 borders .
by all accounts , this is not a plan to bring about a ceasefire , but a look at the much longer term . "
both the egyptian and saudi ideas share the effect of casting ariel sharon as the obstacle to peace " by contrast , the egyptian idea just involves a summit meeting , with no further suggestions about how to take the matter forward .
as president mubarak must know , it is a proposal that is likely to be stillborn .
the whole thrust of ariel sharon 's policy has been to isolate and pressurise yasser arafat .
the israeli leader has refused to meet his palestinian counterpart since taking office .
at the moment , mr arafat is not even allowed to leave the west bank town of ramallah .
us dilemma as for the americans , it leaves them in a more difficult position .
on the one hand , the bush administration is committed to the israeli government .
on the other , the administration will be loath to antagonise mr mubarak .
the initial response of the american secretary of state , colin powell , was to parry the idea as " interesting " .
both the egyptian and saudi ideas share the effect of casting ariel sharon as the obstacle to peace .
they also further increase the pressure on washington to intervene in the ever-worsening conflict .
as the violence increases , almost by the day , it seems much of the energy is being exercised in passing round the blame .

patrick loughlin , 33 , from wrexham , was sentenced to four years ' hard labour for killing a man during a brawl but claims he was wrongly convicted .
with the world cup looming - the 2002 tournament is shared between japan and south korea - the japanese parliament is currently considering signing the council of europe convention on the transfer of prisoners .
it means people convicted of offences such as football hooliganism can be transferred home to complete their prison sentences .
the points were clarified during a meeting between welsh mep glenys kinnock and japan 's ambassador to brussels - naoto nikai .
as far as english football hooligans convicted in japan would be concerned , it means they too could serve their prison sentences in britain .
mr loughlin friend and campaigner , mike hurst , said this was the best news they have had for ages .
mr loughlin was working in kariya , japan , when he was involved in a bar brawl in which a man died .
his supporters , who include mrs kinnock and her fellow mep , eluned morgan , claim he was wrongly convicted after his japanese lawyer , who could not speak english , entered a guilty plea on his behalf .
mr louglin appealed against the conviction but that was turned down in october 2001 by the japanese supreme court although it did cut his sentence by 15 months to two years and nine months .
a civil case against mr loughlin 's original lawyer is also going ahead and his family are also hopeful that they will win that case , and a retrial will be ordered .
win freedom although there is no promise that mr loughlin would come home if the treaty is signed , mr hurst believes it would not look right to send home convicted football hooligans - but not mr loughlin .
mr loughlin 's parents have been at the forefront of a campaign to win his freedom , and last september lobbied foreign office minister baroness amos .
his mother kathleen said her son was beaten by prison guards when he was kept at the nagoya detention centre before he started his sentence .

after the commonwealth summit in australia , failed to take decisive action against robert mugabe 's regime , mr blair warned it could lose its credibility .
and he made a veiled threat that african countries rejecting democracy would find it hard to get aid .
the credibility of the commonwealth depends on us taking action tony blair mr blair insisted the commonwealth would have " no option " other than suspending zimbabwe if president mugabe is found to have rigged the country 's upcoming elections .
but the prime minister defended the four-day meeting in coolum , near brisbane , saying : " it 's still a remarkable gathering of people from different countries , hugely diverse , and i think that 's a positive thing . "
he did not hide his disappointment after the summit opted to leave zimbabwe 's fate to a three-man group made up of nigeria and south africa 's presidents and the australian prime minister .
firm action mr blair said he believed zimbabwe would be suspended if mr mugabe fixed the elections .

after the commonwealth summit in australia , failed to take decisive action against robert mugabe 's regime , mr blair warned it could lose its credibility .
and he made a veiled threat that african countries rejecting democracy would find it hard to get aid . "
the credibility of the commonwealth depends on us taking action " tony blair mr blair insisted the commonwealth would have " no option " other than suspending zimbabwe if president mugabe is found to have rigged the country 's upcoming elections .
but the prime minister defended the four-day meeting in coolum , near brisbane , saying : " it 's still a remarkable gathering of people from different countries , hugely diverse , and i think that 's a positive thing . "
he did not hide his disappointment after the summit opted to leave zimbabwe 's fate to a three-man group made up of nigeria and south africa 's presidents and the australian prime minister .
firm action mr blair said he believed zimbabwe would be suspended if mr mugabe fixed the elections .
" it 's important to recognise what the statement does do is provide for a mechanism to assess the election in zimbabwe and , if the report from our commonwealth observers there is adverse , to take action that is firm .

insurers cancelled war and terrorism coverage in the wake of the plane hijackings .
this forced the governments to intervene to keep the airlines flying .
however the cover runs out this month and the airlines say the surcharge now being demanded by insurers to cover terrorism liabilities - up to $ 3.10 -lrb- £ 2.20 -rrb- per passenger per flight - is far too high .
european airlines , already suffering from overcapacity , recession fears and high fuel prices , were hit hard by the knock-on effects of the attacks on the us , and are seeking to keep extra costs to a minimum .
on tuesday they will call for a three-month extension to the eu guarantees to give them time to set up their own mutual fund to cover their future liabilities from terrorist attacks .
the idea is for regular commercial insurance to cover risks up to $ 150m -lrb- £ 105m -rrb- and for the fund to cover risks between $ 150m and $ 1.5bn , with governments covering risks above that .
the fund would be financed by a ticket surcharge of $ 0.50 if all airlines join , according to a plan drawn up by the association of european airlines -lrb- aea -rrb- .
the international civil aviation organisation -lrb- icao -rrb- are discussing a similar proposal to create a global mutual insurer in montreal on tuesday .
but it was doubts about the viability of a global scheme have prompted european airlines to develop their own alternative , similar to the model recently proposed by us airlines .
roger wiltshire , general secretary of the british air transportation association -lrb- bata -rrb- said that european airlines were supportive of the icao proposal as it was a long-term solution .
but he added : " although it would be good if all the airlines of the world got together , there are some political and legal obstacles to that happening in the short term . "
political opposition brian moore , chairman of the aviation division of marsh , said the mutual would be 25 % to 30 % cheaper than the private insurance options currently available .
" our only concern is whether the governments will support it .
we are getting mixed signals at the moment , " he said .
the plan faces resistance from insurance companies and governments like the uk and finland which are keen on a private market solution .
britain expressed its reluctance at a recent meeting with insurance brokers and british airlines .
martin hedley , chairman of the aerospace division of willis insurance brokers said : " they made it abundantly clear they did n't want to be involved . "
benjamin weber , executive technical partner for aviation at partner re said : " personally , i have my doubts about the viability of the idea of an airline mutual insurer .
" i think the combination of the private sector providing what capacity it feels it can with governments providing a top-up in the event of a big loss is the best solution . "

the shareholders , carlton and granada , have so far sunk more than £ 800 million into the venture , and it now has 1.2 million subscribers .
but it needs many more to break even - and a quarter of those subscribers it does have cancel each year .
with the advertising slump hitting carlton and granada 's revenue , they have been hard-pressed to find the money to continue .
the company has already announced 500 redundancies at its call centre .
but it is still paying out large sums in subsidy because every new subscriber qualifies for a free set-top box -lrb- a problem that may ease with the arrival soon on the market of the first £ 100 digital tv adapters -rrb- .
costs otherwise , the biggest costs it still faces are its deal to broadcast nationwide league matches on its own subscription channel , itv sport - for which it is paying £ 315 million over three years .
payments to companies like bskyb and flextech - which supply it with most of the other channels it sells on to its subscribers - are also costing itv digital a fortune .
not surprisingly , these suppliers have reacted frostily to suggestions they might care to renegotiate their contracts with itv digital to keep the company afloat .
" why on earth are we going to lower our prices ? "
adam singer , chief executive of flextech 's parent telewest , is reported to have asked .
flextech half owns -lrb- with the bbc -rrb- channels like uk gold .

' bring it on ' " if itv digital come to us and say we have to lower our prices or they die , then as a competing platform owner the death bit sounds good to me .
bring it on , " singer apparently said .
the irony is that telewest , along with itv digital and the other big cable company , ntl , suspect bskyb of precisely the same kind of thing , and get very angry about it .
a year ago they complained to the office of fair trading about the way bskyb sets the rates at which it sells channels like sky sports to rival platform operators .
they complained that sky was abusing its dominant market position by over-charging them .
the oft is expected to make a final ruling in may , which may be too late for itv digital .
mr singer can say things openly about exploiting his position as both rival and supplier to force itv digital out of business because , unlike sky , his company is a minority player in the market .
meanwhile the nationwide league and other sports rights holders have their own reasons for not wanting to renegotiate .
everyone from rupert murdoch to greg dyke has been going round saying television sports rights are now way too expensive .
agreeing to cut a cheaper deal with one broadcaster which may have overpaid could open the floodgates to a spate of similar renegotiations - and then where would sport 's television golden goose end up ?

the game designers of the forthcoming title metal gear solid 2 felt the game 's cinematic visuals and strong storyline deserved music of which any hollywood producer would be proud .
so they approached british film composer harry gregson-williams , whose credits include the animated film shrek , the thriller spy game and the disaster movie armageddon .
" they wanted it to sound like a film score and not like a cheap video game , " mr gregson-williams told the bbc programme go digital .
" it was very rewarding , " lush soundscapes as computer graphics get more realistic and sophisticated , game designers are paying more attention to how music can help set up emotional scenes .
ryan : digital opportunities for composers at the same time , digital technology has opened up new possibilities for composers .
" whereas before the technology was inhibiting the music for computer games , it is now actually opening a whole range of possibilities , " said composer and sound designer nick ryan .
" you can now create an incredible range of lush sound , " said mr ryan , who wrote a track for the playstation 2 futuristic racing game wipeout fusion .
fragmented music but writing for an interactive game places its own particular demands on a composer .
wipeout fusion : fast-paced racing game " you ca n't predetermine where a character is going to be in a game so you ca n't write a piece of music that starts at a and ends at b , " explained the composer nick ryan .
" we need to write bits of music that blend into one another and have different emotional resonances .
" we break down the music into small fragments that can be pieced together by the actual game software as you play it . "
creative freedom this is what mr gregson-williams found when he was asked to write the score for metal gear solid 2 : sons of liberty .
he was asked by the game 's designer , hideo kojima , to write a series of music modules , reflecting the different circumstances in which the main character in this action adventure would find himself .
gregson-williams : first soundtrack for a game " the whole appeal of it to me was that in my film-composing career , i have to compose music to the pictures .
the music is dictated by the pictures , " explained mr gregson-williams .
" in this instance , i composed the music without the game , so there was a certain liberty there .
" i was able to compose lots of music which they then fitted into the game , " said the classically trained composer .
" with a film score , i always know how the music is going to end up , " he said .
" with this , i had to write the music in advance and i was never quite sure how the music was going to work with the pictures . "
