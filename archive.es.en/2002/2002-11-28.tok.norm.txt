roxio paid $ 5m in cash plus $ 300,000 worth of roxio shares .
as part of the deal , roxio will be insulated from any future litigation against napster of the past .
following the sale , napster , which ceased operations in september , has been stripped to the bone .
its remaining assets , which consist of hardware such as servers , routers , and computers , will be auctioned off on 11 december .
the proceeds will be handed over to creditors as part of napster 's bankruptcy proceedings .
the future roxio 's challenge will be to develop napster into a new and , perhaps , different company .
earlier this month , roxio chief executive chris gorog said napster 's intellectual property would expand the firm 's " role in the digital media landscape and enhance our offerings to consumers " .
the brand 's fame amongst music fans should also give roxio a leg-up .
though for napster to resurface as a song swapping service , roxio would have to first enter into complex agreements with record companies .
" consumers will not use napster simply for the name when there are other services providing a larger catalogue of music and movies , " said phil leigh , an analyst for raymond james & associates .
roxio shares rose 9 cents to $ 5.37 on wednesday .
copyright issues napster at its peak attracted millions of users who exchanged music files across the internet .
but the firm provoked the wrath of record companies which felt the service was effectively allowing users to download and use music files without copyright and crucially without paying .
after lengthy legal action the service was shut down , and despite promises that it would one day relaunch it has struggled financially .
a whole host of similar services to napster have sprung up , many of which face legal action , while official services , such as pressplay , have also launched .

scientists at the institute of neurology in london have found evidence bse , in addition to causing so-called variant cjd -lrb- vcjd -rrb- , may also be responsible for some cases of " sporadic " cjd .
so far , 117 people in britain have died from the incurable brain disease variant vcjd .
previously , the cause of cases of sporadic cjd - a different strain of the disease - was not known .
the strain , which has been identified for many years , tends to affect older people and a link with eating infected beef had never been made .
now , however , researchers say some cases of sporadic cjd may have been caused by people eating bse-infected beef in the late 80s and early 90s .
urgent study professor john collinge , who led the research on mice at university college , london , told the guardian newspaper : " when you counsel those who have the classical sporadic disease , you tell them this is not related to what you read in the newspapers , it arises spontaneously out of the blue .
" i guess we can no longer say that . "
the researchers want a national study to be carried out urgently to assess the true scale of cjd infection .
the government says the new findings are potentially important and insists its expert committee will be examining them closely .
it may force the department of health to reconsider the size of its compensation scheme for families affected by bse .

"
belarus has always been and will always be a friend to russia " alexander lukashenko however , they stopped short of giving exact dates or details of the creation of the new union state .
mr lukashenko was invited to moscow shortly after all european union states - except for portugal - and the united states imposed a travel ban on him and his senior ministers over their human rights record .
the bbc 's nikolai gorshkov in moscow says that mr lukashenko was obviously mindful of the international isolation he got himself into , and thanked mr putin for his support .
our correspondent says that , having been ostracised by the west , mr lukashenko now sees moscow as his only hope .
' humbled president ' the union project has been under way for five years , but has been beset by wrangles between moscow and minsk about power-sharing in the new state .
our correspondent says that the presidents ' news conference was an anticlimax - but their body language said more than their words .
in contrast to a spectacular outburst just three months ago , when mr lukahenko accused mr putin of insulting belarus by trying to turn it into another province of russia , this time he looked subdued and humbled .
mr lukashenko said belarus was russia 's last frontier which it can not afford to lose .
" belarus has always been and will always be a friend to russia , " he said .
mr lukashenko also played down the significance of washington 's move , reportedly saying : " i 've never gone to the united states for bilateral talks up to now and i think i 'll do without it now , too . "
the us has described the belarussian president as europe 's last dictator .
key fuel issue for his part , president putin said moscow had given up a lot over the past 10 years , and it was time to start picking up things .
experts say he was referring to the major issue between the two countries - such as russian oil and gas supplies at subsidised rates - which still remain unresolved .
russian companies want to end this unprofitable practice and are demanding that belarussian state-owned enterprises are sold off .
after arriving in moscow , mr lukashenko said he would soon put up belarus ' natural gas pipeline network , beltransgaz , for privatisation .
he would sign the necessary papers next week , the itar-tass news agency reported .
