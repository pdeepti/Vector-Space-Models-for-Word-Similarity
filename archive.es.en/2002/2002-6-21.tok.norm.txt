two car bombs , planted by the basque terrorist group eta , exploded in the coastal cities of marbella and fuengirola in the hours before the summit started on friday afternoon .
the terrorist attacks in two tourist resorts severely injured a british man and five others , including children .
the detonations sent shock waves through those gathered for the eu summit , who are meeting for two days to wrestle with some highly controversial issues .
immigration at the top of the agenda and occupying editorial pages across europe the past week is immigration .
namely , the fight against the boatloads of illegal immigrants that wash up on italian , spanish and british shores annually and the stream of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers smuggled in by professional rings .

a proposal to financially punish an illegal immigrant ’ s country of origin for not doing more to stop his flight has split the eu .
sweden and france are dead against the idea .
great britain , italy and germany support it .
enlargement with immigration already on the agenda , the eu 's eastward expansion could prove too spicy a topic for this summit .
all eu member countries welcome enlargement , which could bring as many as 10 new members into the fold in 2004 .
but , as with many eu plans , the devil is in the details .
agricultural subsidies for the new member states has divided eu members like france and germany .
germany is demanding that new member states , like poland , do more to reform their farming industry . berlin also wants to cut the amount of agricultural subsidies brussels doles out each year .
france , heavily reliant on such subsidies , is firmly against the idea .
french president jacques chirac enjoys the support of the country ’ s powerful farm lobby .
but spain just wants the topic to go away .
after this summit , it hands over the six-month presidency of the eu to denmark .
reforming the eu again , a power play between great britain , france , germany and italy .
the uk and france favor putting power in the already-established eu council of ministers , where a minister from each nation represents his country ’ s interests .

the european union commission on thursday said it would be launching a probe into germany 's so-called vw law , the special regulation that effectively protects car maker volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover . the european court recently banned the use of " golden shares " in former state-owned companies .
now the european commission is looking into other mechanisms through which governments can intervene in the takeover process , and lower saxony ’ s special rights within volkswagen are high on its list .
the european union commission on thursday said it would be launching a probe into germany 's so-called vw law , the special regulation that effectively protects car maker volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover .
a spokesman for internal market commissioner frits bolkestein said that his office would be examining the vw law " very carefully " .
meanwhile , chancellor gerhard schröder categorically rejected the idea of any change in the vw law .
schröder told a meeting of the vw works council : " under my leadership , there will be no alterations to this law in germany , and we will fight anybody who tries , via the european union , to get a change of this kind introduced . "
when he was premier of the german state of lower saxony , schröder had a seat on the vw supervisory board .
lower saxony 's government owns just under 20 % of vw 's shares , and a special regulation prevents any other shareholder from controlling more than 20 % of the company 's voting rights .
that regulation made volkswagen the only german company to enjoy the kind of protection afforded the french former state-owned firms by the " golden share " mechanism .
and it 's a recent landmark ruling by the european court of justice , effectively banning the use of golden shares , that has led bolkestein to look into other ways in which governments within europe have secured themselves the right to intervene in the takeover process .
along with the vw law , nine other similar arrangements are up for review , said the commissioner 's spokesman .
over one year ago , a british investor group lodged a complaint in brussels against the vw law .

illegal immigrants at the eurotunnel separating france and england .
germany 's new immigration law is designed to attract highly-qualified workers .
those losing out appear to be asylum seekers , many of whom could go underground rather than face deportation . christopher nsoh had no plans to come to germany .
when you have hours to get out of your country or face death , you don ’ t go through a travel agent anyway .
his trip to europe involved hiding out at a friend ’ s house for a week before getting a spot in the compartment of a ship heading out of cameroon toward germany .
more than a week later , nsoh disembarked in hamburg , skirted the border control and made his way to düsseldorf .
there , he applied for asylum .
that was five years ago .
during that time , the political activist was forced to live in an asylum home near berlin , buy food using the german equivalent of food stamps at a special market and , worst of all , wasn ’ t allowed to work , he said . " i felt myself deteriorating , " said nsoh , 33 , who was a lawyer specializing in international law in cameroon .
fates like nsoh ’ s will hopefully be avoided in the future , if the immigration law passed by germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , ever becomes law .
german president johannes rau signed the bill into law on thursday , but its future remains uncertain .
the conservative opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government on thursday filed suit against the passage of the law in constitutional court .
the christian democratic union says the way in which the law passed upper parliament is unconstitutional .
will asylum-seekers be left in the cold ?
while politicians and lawyers battle over details of what many call a progressive new german immigration law , nsoh is convinced the law hasn ’ t done enough to protect asylum seekers like himself .
the new law seeks to bring in highly-qualified immigrants to come to germany by doing away with a lot of the bureaucratic red tape that kept them from staying here .
in trimming down the byzantine process , the law also promises to speed up the decisions on asylum cases like nsoh ’ s , who is still waiting for a government verdict on his application .

in a policy that mirrors the tough talk on asylum seekers and illegal immigrants currently taking place in denmark , italy and britain , the new law also aims to deport those rejected for asylum in a quicker manner .
especially affected are around 250,000 asylum applicants currently " tolerated " by the german government , according to the german lobby group pro asyl .
pushing them into the underground faced with possibility of forced stay in one of the newly-created deportation centers or diving into the underground , advocates fear many will choose the latter .
" people who ’ s lives are threatened will not be able to exploit this law that gives them the right to seek asylum , " said nsoh , who is active in the brandenburg refugee initiative .
" i think the europeans , and the germans in particular , should be careful with such a law , because it ’ s going to portray how discriminative and racist germany and europe is becoming . "
the fiery words are one side of the furious debate taking place at a european summit in seville , spain this weekend .
the other side are countries such as the netherlands , england and germany , who favor tightening the borders to stop the flow of immigrants , both legal and illegal streaming into their countries .
politicians in those countries are feeling the heat of voters flabbergasted that their governments would take on more immigrants in times of high unemployment and overburdened social welfare budgets .

illegal immigrants at the eurotunnel separating france and england .
germany 's new immigration law is designed to attract highly-qualified workers .
those losing out appear to be asylum seekers , many of whom could go underground rather than face deportation . christopher nsoh had no plans to come to germany .
when you have hours to get out of your country or face death , you don ’ t go through a travel agent anyway .
his trip to europe involved hiding out at a friend ’ s house for a week before getting a spot in the compartment of a ship heading out of cameroon toward germany .
more than a week later , nsoh disembarked in hamburg , skirted the border control and made his way to düsseldorf .
there , he applied for asylum .
that was five years ago .
during that time , the political activist was forced to live in an asylum home near berlin , buy food using the german equivalent of food stamps at a special market and , worst of all , wasn ’ t allowed to work , he said . " i felt myself deteriorating , " said nsoh , 33 , who was a lawyer specializing in international law in cameroon .
fates like nsoh ’ s will hopefully be avoided in the future , if the immigration law passed by germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , ever becomes law .
german president johannes rau signed the bill into law on thursday , but its future remains uncertain .
the conservative opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government on thursday filed suit against the passage of the law in constitutional court .
the christian democratic union says the way in which the law passed upper parliament is unconstitutional .
will asylum-seekers be left in the cold ?
while politicians and lawyers battle over details of what many call a progressive new german immigration law , nsoh is convinced the law hasn ’ t done enough to protect asylum seekers like himself .
the new law seeks to bring in highly-qualified immigrants to come to germany by doing away with a lot of the bureaucratic red tape that kept them from staying here .
in trimming down the byzantine process , the law also promises to speed up the decisions on asylum cases like nsoh ’ s , who is still waiting for a government verdict on his application .

the move comes two months after a school shooting in the eastern town of erfurt that left 17 dead . robert steinhäuser has changed germany .
two months ago , the 19-year-old former student stormed into his old school in the eastern german city of erfurt armed to the teeth .

on friday , there was no disagreement among the heads of the 16 german states , or länder , that are represented in the bundesrat .
they unanimously ratified a proposal to raise the age limit for gun ownership and ban the use of pump-action shotguns .

the european union commission on thursday said it would be launching a probe into germany 's so-called vw law , the special regulation that effectively protects car maker volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover . the european court recently banned the use of " golden shares " in former state-owned companies .
now the european commission is looking into other mechanisms through which governments can intervene in the takeover process , and lower saxony ’ s special rights within volkswagen are high on its list .
the european union commission on thursday said it would be launching a probe into germany 's so-called vw law , the special regulation that effectively protects car maker volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover .
a spokesman for internal market commissioner frits bolkestein said that his office would be examining the vw law " very carefully " .
meanwhile , chancellor gerhard schröder categorically rejected the idea of any change in the vw law .
schröder told a meeting of the vw works council : " under my leadership , there will be no alterations to this law in germany , and we will fight anybody who tries , via the european union , to get a change of this kind introduced . "
when he was premier of the german state of lower saxony , schröder had a seat on the vw supervisory board .
lower saxony 's government owns just under 20 % of vw 's shares , and a special regulation prevents any other shareholder from controlling more than 20 % of the company 's voting rights .
that regulation made volkswagen the only german company to enjoy the kind of protection afforded the french former state-owned firms by the " golden share " mechanism .
and it 's a recent landmark ruling by the european court of justice , effectively banning the use of golden shares , that has led bolkestein to look into other ways in which governments within europe have secured themselves the right to intervene in the takeover process .
along with the vw law , nine other similar arrangements are up for review , said the commissioner 's spokesman .
over one year ago , a british investor group lodged a complaint in brussels against the vw law .
the commission did not act on the complaint because it preferred to wait for the european court ruling on the golden shares . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 20.06.02 © economy .

the move comes two months after a school shooting in the eastern town of erfurt that left 17 dead . robert steinhäuser has changed germany .
two months ago , the 19-year-old former student stormed into his old school in the eastern german city of erfurt armed to the teeth .
within 20 minutes , he killed 13 teachers , two students , a policeman and , finally , himself .
the erfurt school shooting was germany 's worst post-war massacre .
erfurt gave endeavors to tighten gun laws in germany new momentum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesrat building , berlin , germany before the massacre , numerous efforts to tighten the country 's already strict gun-control regulations were blocked by the conservative christian democrats .
on friday , however , politicians of all parties stood united on the issue in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
on friday , there was no disagreement among the heads of the 16 german states , or länder , that are represented in the bundesrat .
they unanimously ratified a proposal to raise the age limit for gun ownership and ban the use of pump-action shotguns .

the move comes two months after a school shooting in the eastern town of erfurt that left 17 dead . robert steinhäuser has changed germany .
two months ago , the 19-year-old former student stormed into his old school in the eastern german city of erfurt armed to the teeth .
within 20 minutes , he killed 13 teachers , two students , a policeman and , finally , himself .
the erfurt school shooting was germany 's worst post-war massacre .
erfurt gave endeavors to tighten gun laws in germany new momentum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesrat building , berlin , germany before the massacre , numerous efforts to tighten the country 's already strict gun-control regulations were blocked by the conservative christian democrats .
on friday , however , politicians of all parties stood united on the issue in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
on friday , there was no disagreement among the heads of the 16 german states , or länder , that are represented in the bundesrat .
they unanimously ratified a proposal to raise the age limit for gun ownership and ban the use of pump-action shotguns .
the new gun law raises the age for ownership from 18 to 21 and requires gun buyers under 25 to present a certificate of medical and psychological health .
the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , had okayed the bill just a week ago .
only the first step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister after friday 's vote in the bundesrat , interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said the new law was the first step towards wider reforms .
" the re-worked law will give us more control and security .
but it is only one step of several , " schily told the upper legislative chamber .
but schily added that the real danger does n't come from legally-owned weapons .
he said that attention should now focus on illegally-held guns .
the estimates on how many illegal weapons there are in germany vary considerably .
what is known , however , is that there are 7.2 million legally owned guns in germany .
out of a population of 83 million , 2.3 million people in germany are registered gun owners .
gun laws the key to security ?
shortly after the erfurt school shooting , interior minister schily said tougher laws could not have prevented the massacre .
steinhäuser , the 19-year-old who ran amok , had been able to obtain his weapons legally , since he was a member of a gun club .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder but the government still advocated tightening restrictions on weapons .
in the weeks following the erfurt school shooting , interior minister schily and chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- became the driving forces behind a cross-party coalition to tighten gun control laws .
their goal was also to restrict the sale and distribution of violent videos and computer games .
steinhäuser was known to be a big fan of such violent electronic entertainment .
tighter monitoring of violent computer games and websites along with tightening gun laws , the bundesrat on friday also approved tighter controls for violent computer games , websites and videos .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' counter-strike ' was robert steinhäuser 's favorite computer game all computer games now have to bear a label indicating how old kids should be to play them .
a similar procedure of parental-discretion labels is already used to keep children and young people from buying or renting videos that are unsuitable for them – e.g. pornographic films or videos that glorify war .
to make the tracking of age-sensitive media easier , the bundesrat also approved a simplified procedure to put extremely violent or pornographic websites on an index .
but placing restrictions on the content of video games , films and websites is a thorny issue – and interior minister schily is well aware of it .
in may , he acknowledged that such restrictions could be seen as infringing upon the right to free speech and artistic expression .
" the question of art and free speech is difficult to resolve ... there are violent scenes in shakespeare but no one would ban shakespeare , " schily said then . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the blame game after the debate on tightening gun laws , germany ’ s political establishment has predictably turned to the media to curb its dishing out of violence .
but not everybody is swallowing the media-violence link .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.06.2002 division highlights eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the political wrestling arena the two-day european union summit in seville , spain , this weekend promises to be a nail-biter as european leaders seek to work out their differences over immigration and eu enlargement . spain is hosting the last european union summit of it ’ s six-month presidential tenure in seville this weekend , and it doesn ’ t promise to be pleasant .
two car bombs , planted by the basque terrorist group eta , exploded in the coastal cities of marbella and fuengirola in the hours before the summit started on friday afternoon .
the terrorist attacks in two tourist resorts severely injured a british man and five others , including children .
the detonations sent shock waves through those gathered for the eu summit , who are meeting for two days to wrestle with some highly controversial issues .
immigration at the top of the agenda and occupying editorial pages across europe the past week is immigration .
namely , the fight against the boatloads of illegal immigrants that wash up on italian , spanish and british shores annually and the stream of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers smuggled in by professional rings .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unidentified would-be immigrants sit on the deck of a civil guard boat after they were intercepted trying to reach the spanish canary island of fuerteventura near tuineje in a small motorized boat from africa wednesday june 19 , 2002 .
one of the main items to discuss during the european union summit in seville june 21-22 is immigration in europe .
-lrb- ap photo / efe , juan medina -rrb- * * spain out * * though the actual numbers of asylum seekers has gone down in recent years , eu leaders felt they needed to address the topic to wrest control of the political debate over the issue away from far-right populists .
tighter borders , more cooperation between law enforcement of the member states and sharing visa information are the least controversial and , therefore , most likely results of the two-day discussions .
a proposal to financially punish an illegal immigrant ’ s country of origin for not doing more to stop his flight has split the eu .
sweden and france are dead against the idea .
great britain , italy and germany support it .
enlargement with immigration already on the agenda , the eu 's eastward expansion could prove too spicy a topic for this summit .
all eu member countries welcome enlargement , which could bring as many as 10 new members into the fold in 2004 .
but , as with many eu plans , the devil is in the details .
agricultural subsidies for the new member states has divided eu members like france and germany .
germany is demanding that new member states , like poland , do more to reform their farming industry . berlin also wants to cut the amount of agricultural subsidies brussels doles out each year .
france , heavily reliant on such subsidies , is firmly against the idea .
french president jacques chirac enjoys the support of the country ’ s powerful farm lobby .
but spain just wants the topic to go away .
after this summit , it hands over the six-month presidency of the eu to denmark .
reforming the eu again , a power play between great britain , france , germany and italy .
the uk and france favor putting power in the already-established eu council of ministers , where a minister from each nation represents his country ’ s interests .
germany and the union ’ s smaller countries favor keeping power in the european commission , the union ’ s policy-initiating body .
the preference is in line with germany ’ s desire to shape the union into more of a federation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turning the legal into the illegal germany 's new immigration law is designed to attract highly-qualified workers .
those losing out appear to be asylum seekers , many of whom could go underground rather than face deportation .
making the eu more transparent most europeans feel the eu is bureaucratic and inefficient .
europe ’ s leaders rose to the challenge at a weekend summit in belgium in december .

the european union commission on thursday said it would be launching a probe into germany 's so-called vw law , the special regulation that effectively protects car maker volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover . the european court recently banned the use of " golden shares " in former state-owned companies .
now the european commission is looking into other mechanisms through which governments can intervene in the takeover process , and lower saxony ’ s special rights within volkswagen are high on its list .
the european union commission on thursday said it would be launching a probe into germany 's so-called vw law , the special regulation that effectively protects car maker volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover .
a spokesman for internal market commissioner frits bolkestein said that his office would be examining the vw law " very carefully " .
meanwhile , chancellor gerhard schröder categorically rejected the idea of any change in the vw law .
schröder told a meeting of the vw works council : " under my leadership , there will be no alterations to this law in germany , and we will fight anybody who tries , via the european union , to get a change of this kind introduced . "
when he was premier of the german state of lower saxony , schröder had a seat on the vw supervisory board .
lower saxony 's government owns just under 20 % of vw 's shares , and a special regulation prevents any other shareholder from controlling more than 20 % of the company 's voting rights .
that regulation made volkswagen the only german company to enjoy the kind of protection afforded the french former state-owned firms by the " golden share " mechanism .
and it 's a recent landmark ruling by the european court of justice , effectively banning the use of golden shares , that has led bolkestein to look into other ways in which governments within europe have secured themselves the right to intervene in the takeover process .
along with the vw law , nine other similar arrangements are up for review , said the commissioner 's spokesman .
over one year ago , a british investor group lodged a complaint in brussels against the vw law .
the commission did not act on the complaint because it preferred to wait for the european court ruling on the golden shares . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 20.06.02 © economy .

the european union commission on thursday said it would be launching a probe into germany 's so-called vw law , the special regulation that effectively protects car maker volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover . the european court recently banned the use of " golden shares " in former state-owned companies .
now the european commission is looking into other mechanisms through which governments can intervene in the takeover process , and lower saxony ’ s special rights within volkswagen are high on its list .
the european union commission on thursday said it would be launching a probe into germany 's so-called vw law , the special regulation that effectively protects car maker volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover .
a spokesman for internal market commissioner frits bolkestein said that his office would be examining the vw law " very carefully " .
meanwhile , chancellor gerhard schröder categorically rejected the idea of any change in the vw law .
schröder told a meeting of the vw works council : " under my leadership , there will be no alterations to this law in germany , and we will fight anybody who tries , via the european union , to get a change of this kind introduced . "
when he was premier of the german state of lower saxony , schröder had a seat on the vw supervisory board .
lower saxony 's government owns just under 20 % of vw 's shares , and a special regulation prevents any other shareholder from controlling more than 20 % of the company 's voting rights .
that regulation made volkswagen the only german company to enjoy the kind of protection afforded the french former state-owned firms by the " golden share " mechanism .
and it 's a recent landmark ruling by the european court of justice , effectively banning the use of golden shares , that has led bolkestein to look into other ways in which governments within europe have secured themselves the right to intervene in the takeover process .
along with the vw law , nine other similar arrangements are up for review , said the commissioner 's spokesman .
over one year ago , a british investor group lodged a complaint in brussels against the vw law .
the commission did not act on the complaint because it preferred to wait for the european court ruling on the golden shares . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 20.06.02 © economy .

the game was being showed on tv .
they could have been at home alone , with a fridge of cold , reasonably-priced beer within striding distance .
no fighting for the bar ; no repetitive strain injury from craning to see a blurry screen , no diminishing bank balance .
instead , 250 england fans descended on their local pub for a fried breakfast and joyful alcohol consumption as their country pulled off a majestic victory over argentina .
the flipside of that coin shows us the 5,000 weeping french who crowded together outside the place de l ’ hôtel de ville in the dull and spitting wet weather of an early parisian morning to witness their country ’ s exit from the 2002 world cup .
watching together while scaremongers tell us that our reliance on technologies such as the internet will ultimately turn us into socially-inept hermits lacking , and consequently fearing , human interaction , the world cup has shown that humans as a species love to get together .
each nation , regardless of rich cultural differences , likes to get out on the streets to share a common event of importance for their country .
the bonding that may come from experiencing the highs and lows of a football match on this scale shows us something about ourselves .
be it as a member of a crowd watching a huge screen in trafalgar square or as a small group huddled around a radio in a sao paulo doctor ’ s waiting room , we want to go through it together .
strangers rally each other in the cause of support ; a grip of the forearm in tense moments , a slap on the back or bear hug in victory can unite people for 90 minutes .
escaping reality even the woes of the outside world can be forgotten .
although facing the most crippling recession in their history and a crumbling economy , the argentineans rallied in the streets of buenos aires to show solidarity with their team and each other .
old scores can be put to rest without the need to go to war .
international tensions were reduced to a certain degree when japan beat russia .
although two people sadly died in the riots that followed in moscow , no doubt more would have died if the two nations would have gone to war over the islands .
some old colonial scores have been settled as well .
senegal ’ s history will have a glorious night written into it after france , the country ’ s old master , was beaten in the first game .
the elimination of france may also be another comment from the new international language of football .
when les bleus won the trophy in 1998 , they were a multi-cultural team made up of blacks , whites and arabs .
the country had the fastest falling unemployment in its history and a socialist government had just been elected .
this year , as the extremists rose to prominence , unemployment increased and a conservative government came into power , the french were deposed .
maybe the france of 1998 was welcome and the 2002 version is not .
new talent , new flavor with the rise of african and asian talent , larger parts of the world are being seduced by this sport that has many names .
whether it ’ s football , soccer or fußball , the global spread of its popularity and its ability to bring people together has been proved by the current tournament .
it may not bring world peace , as claimed in the opening ceremony by fifa president sepp blatter , but it has a certain talent for promoting unity … which is the end of another word : community . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

illegal immigrants at the eurotunnel separating france and england .
germany 's new immigration law is designed to attract highly-qualified workers .
those losing out appear to be asylum seekers , many of whom could go underground rather than face deportation . christopher nsoh had no plans to come to germany .
when you have hours to get out of your country or face death , you don ’ t go through a travel agent anyway .
his trip to europe involved hiding out at a friend ’ s house for a week before getting a spot in the compartment of a ship heading out of cameroon toward germany .
more than a week later , nsoh disembarked in hamburg , skirted the border control and made his way to düsseldorf .
there , he applied for asylum .
that was five years ago .
during that time , the political activist was forced to live in an asylum home near berlin , buy food using the german equivalent of food stamps at a special market and , worst of all , wasn ’ t allowed to work , he said . " i felt myself deteriorating , " said nsoh , 33 , who was a lawyer specializing in international law in cameroon .
fates like nsoh ’ s will hopefully be avoided in the future , if the immigration law passed by germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , ever becomes law .
german president johannes rau signed the bill into law on thursday , but its future remains uncertain .
the conservative opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government on thursday filed suit against the passage of the law in constitutional court .
the christian democratic union says the way in which the law passed upper parliament is unconstitutional .
will asylum-seekers be left in the cold ?
while politicians and lawyers battle over details of what many call a progressive new german immigration law , nsoh is convinced the law hasn ’ t done enough to protect asylum seekers like himself .
the new law seeks to bring in highly-qualified immigrants to come to germany by doing away with a lot of the bureaucratic red tape that kept them from staying here .
in trimming down the byzantine process , the law also promises to speed up the decisions on asylum cases like nsoh ’ s , who is still waiting for a government verdict on his application .

in a policy that mirrors the tough talk on asylum seekers and illegal immigrants currently taking place in denmark , italy and britain , the new law also aims to deport those rejected for asylum in a quicker manner .
especially affected are around 250,000 asylum applicants currently " tolerated " by the german government , according to the german lobby group pro asyl .
pushing them into the underground faced with possibility of forced stay in one of the newly-created deportation centers or diving into the underground , advocates fear many will choose the latter .
" people who ’ s lives are threatened will not be able to exploit this law that gives them the right to seek asylum , " said nsoh , who is active in the brandenburg refugee initiative .
" i think the europeans , and the germans in particular , should be careful with such a law , because it ’ s going to portray how discriminative and racist germany and europe is becoming . "
the fiery words are one side of the furious debate taking place at a european summit in seville , spain this weekend .
the other side are countries such as the netherlands , england and germany , who favor tightening the borders to stop the flow of immigrants , both legal and illegal streaming into their countries .
politicians in those countries are feeling the heat of voters flabbergasted that their governments would take on more immigrants in times of high unemployment and overburdened social welfare budgets .

in areas like illegal immigration , the eu ’ s member states still prefer to go their own way .
that means a tougher journey for people like nsoh and one more and more likely to be undertaken illegally .

the european union commission on thursday said it would be launching a probe into germany 's so-called vw law , the special regulation that effectively protects car maker volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover . the european court recently banned the use of " golden shares " in former state-owned companies .
now the european commission is looking into other mechanisms through which governments can intervene in the takeover process , and lower saxony ’ s special rights within volkswagen are high on its list .
the european union commission on thursday said it would be launching a probe into germany 's so-called vw law , the special regulation that effectively protects car maker volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover .
a spokesman for internal market commissioner frits bolkestein said that his office would be examining the vw law " very carefully " .
meanwhile , chancellor gerhard schröder categorically rejected the idea of any change in the vw law .
schröder told a meeting of the vw works council : " under my leadership , there will be no alterations to this law in germany , and we will fight anybody who tries , via the european union , to get a change of this kind introduced . "
when he was premier of the german state of lower saxony , schröder had a seat on the vw supervisory board .
lower saxony 's government owns just under 20 % of vw 's shares , and a special regulation prevents any other shareholder from controlling more than 20 % of the company 's voting rights .
that regulation made volkswagen the only german company to enjoy the kind of protection afforded the french former state-owned firms by the " golden share " mechanism .
and it 's a recent landmark ruling by the european court of justice , effectively banning the use of golden shares , that has led bolkestein to look into other ways in which governments within europe have secured themselves the right to intervene in the takeover process .
along with the vw law , nine other similar arrangements are up for review , said the commissioner 's spokesman .
over one year ago , a british investor group lodged a complaint in brussels against the vw law .
the commission did not act on the complaint because it preferred to wait for the european court ruling on the golden shares . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links source : handelsblatt.com 20.06.02 © economy .

the move comes two months after a school shooting in the eastern town of erfurt that left 17 dead . robert steinhäuser has changed germany .
two months ago , the 19-year-old former student stormed into his old school in the eastern german city of erfurt armed to the teeth .
within 20 minutes , he killed 13 teachers , two students , a policeman and , finally , himself .
the erfurt school shooting was germany 's worst post-war massacre .

on friday , there was no disagreement among the heads of the 16 german states , or länder , that are represented in the bundesrat .
they unanimously ratified a proposal to raise the age limit for gun ownership and ban the use of pump-action shotguns .
the new gun law raises the age for ownership from 18 to 21 and requires gun buyers under 25 to present a certificate of medical and psychological health .

but it is only one step of several , " schily told the upper legislative chamber .
but schily added that the real danger does n't come from legally-owned weapons .
he said that attention should now focus on illegally-held guns .
the estimates on how many illegal weapons there are in germany vary considerably .
what is known , however , is that there are 7.2 million legally owned guns in germany .
out of a population of 83 million , 2.3 million people in germany are registered gun owners .
gun laws the key to security ?

in the weeks following the erfurt school shooting , interior minister schily and chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- became the driving forces behind a cross-party coalition to tighten gun control laws .
their goal was also to restrict the sale and distribution of violent videos and computer games .

to make the tracking of age-sensitive media easier , the bundesrat also approved a simplified procedure to put extremely violent or pornographic websites on an index .
but placing restrictions on the content of video games , films and websites is a thorny issue – and interior minister schily is well aware of it .

the move comes two months after a school shooting in the eastern town of erfurt that left 17 dead . robert steinhäuser has changed germany .
two months ago , the 19-year-old former student stormed into his old school in the eastern german city of erfurt armed to the teeth .
within 20 minutes , he killed 13 teachers , two students , a policeman and , finally , himself .
the erfurt school shooting was germany 's worst post-war massacre .
erfurt gave endeavors to tighten gun laws in germany new momentum .

on friday , however , politicians of all parties stood united on the issue in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
on friday , there was no disagreement among the heads of the 16 german states , or länder , that are represented in the bundesrat .
they unanimously ratified a proposal to raise the age limit for gun ownership and ban the use of pump-action shotguns .
the new gun law raises the age for ownership from 18 to 21 and requires gun buyers under 25 to present a certificate of medical and psychological health .
the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , had okayed the bill just a week ago .

but it is only one step of several , " schily told the upper legislative chamber .
but schily added that the real danger does n't come from legally-owned weapons .
he said that attention should now focus on illegally-held guns .
the estimates on how many illegal weapons there are in germany vary considerably .
what is known , however , is that there are 7.2 million legally owned guns in germany .
out of a population of 83 million , 2.3 million people in germany are registered gun owners .
gun laws the key to security ?
shortly after the erfurt school shooting , interior minister schily said tougher laws could not have prevented the massacre .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder but the government still advocated tightening restrictions on weapons .
in the weeks following the erfurt school shooting , interior minister schily and chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- became the driving forces behind a cross-party coalition to tighten gun control laws .
their goal was also to restrict the sale and distribution of violent videos and computer games .
steinhäuser was known to be a big fan of such violent electronic entertainment .

a similar procedure of parental-discretion labels is already used to keep children and young people from buying or renting videos that are unsuitable for them – e.g. pornographic films or videos that glorify war .
to make the tracking of age-sensitive media easier , the bundesrat also approved a simplified procedure to put extremely violent or pornographic websites on an index .
but placing restrictions on the content of video games , films and websites is a thorny issue – and interior minister schily is well aware of it .
in may , he acknowledged that such restrictions could be seen as infringing upon the right to free speech and artistic expression .

illegal immigrants at the eurotunnel separating france and england .
germany 's new immigration law is designed to attract highly-qualified workers .
those losing out appear to be asylum seekers , many of whom could go underground rather than face deportation . christopher nsoh had no plans to come to germany .
when you have hours to get out of your country or face death , you don ’ t go through a travel agent anyway .
his trip to europe involved hiding out at a friend ’ s house for a week before getting a spot in the compartment of a ship heading out of cameroon toward germany .
more than a week later , nsoh disembarked in hamburg , skirted the border control and made his way to düsseldorf .
there , he applied for asylum .
that was five years ago .
during that time , the political activist was forced to live in an asylum home near berlin , buy food using the german equivalent of food stamps at a special market and , worst of all , wasn ’ t allowed to work , he said . " i felt myself deteriorating , " said nsoh , 33 , who was a lawyer specializing in international law in cameroon .
fates like nsoh ’ s will hopefully be avoided in the future , if the immigration law passed by germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , ever becomes law .
german president johannes rau signed the bill into law on thursday , but its future remains uncertain .
the conservative opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government on thursday filed suit against the passage of the law in constitutional court .
the christian democratic union says the way in which the law passed upper parliament is unconstitutional .
will asylum-seekers be left in the cold ?
while politicians and lawyers battle over details of what many call a progressive new german immigration law , nsoh is convinced the law hasn ’ t done enough to protect asylum seekers like himself .
the new law seeks to bring in highly-qualified immigrants to come to germany by doing away with a lot of the bureaucratic red tape that kept them from staying here .
in trimming down the byzantine process , the law also promises to speed up the decisions on asylum cases like nsoh ’ s , who is still waiting for a government verdict on his application .

zwei tage vor der mit spannung erwarteten abstimmung über das zuwanderungsgesetz im bundesrat befassen sich die regierungen der ausschlaggebenden länder am dienstag , 19 .
märz 2002 mit dem thema .
in a policy that mirrors the tough talk on asylum seekers and illegal immigrants currently taking place in denmark , italy and britain , the new law also aims to deport those rejected for asylum in a quicker manner .
especially affected are around 250,000 asylum applicants currently " tolerated " by the german government , according to the german lobby group pro asyl .
pushing them into the underground faced with possibility of forced stay in one of the newly-created deportation centers or diving into the underground , advocates fear many will choose the latter .
" people who ’ s lives are threatened will not be able to exploit this law that gives them the right to seek asylum , " said nsoh , who is active in the brandenburg refugee initiative .
" i think the europeans , and the germans in particular , should be careful with such a law , because it ’ s going to portray how discriminative and racist germany and europe is becoming . "
the fiery words are one side of the furious debate taking place at a european summit in seville , spain this weekend .
the other side are countries such as the netherlands , england and germany , who favor tightening the borders to stop the flow of immigrants , both legal and illegal streaming into their countries .
politicians in those countries are feeling the heat of voters flabbergasted that their governments would take on more immigrants in times of high unemployment and overburdened social welfare budgets .
" you see a competition of restrictions for refugees , " said bernd mesovic , of pro asyl .
" it ’ s difficult to see what european country is in front at the moment and which is behind . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan refugee crosses razor wire fence to illegally enter britain via channel tunnel , sangatte , france at the seville summit , european leaders are expected to talk about better cooperation among law enforcement at the borders and in exchanging visa information .
a europe-wide asylum policy , proposed at a summit in tampere , finland in 1999 , will be presented in modified form , but experts say there is likely to be little agreement on it .
in areas like illegal immigration , the eu ’ s member states still prefer to go their own way .
that means a tougher journey for people like nsoh and one more and more likely to be undertaken illegally .
" we were more optimistic of the refugee issue over the past years , " said mesovic .
" but what the european countries and governments have done , especially after the 11th of september is a kind of sabotage .
they ... put the strees on a policy of a fight against immigration .

the move comes two months after a school shooting in the eastern town of erfurt that left 17 dead . robert steinhäuser has changed germany .
two months ago , the 19-year-old former student stormed into his old school in the eastern german city of erfurt armed to the teeth .
within 20 minutes , he killed 13 teachers , two students , a policeman and , finally , himself .
the erfurt school shooting was germany 's worst post-war massacre .
erfurt gave endeavors to tighten gun laws in germany new momentum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesrat building , berlin , germany before the massacre , numerous efforts to tighten the country 's already strict gun-control regulations were blocked by the conservative christian democrats .
on friday , however , politicians of all parties stood united on the issue in germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat -lrb- photo -rrb- .
on friday , there was no disagreement among the heads of the 16 german states , or länder , that are represented in the bundesrat .
they unanimously ratified a proposal to raise the age limit for gun ownership and ban the use of pump-action shotguns .
the new gun law raises the age for ownership from 18 to 21 and requires gun buyers under 25 to present a certificate of medical and psychological health .
the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , had okayed the bill just a week ago .
only the first step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister after friday 's vote in the bundesrat , interior minister otto schily -lrb- photo -rrb- said the new law was the first step towards wider reforms .
" the re-worked law will give us more control and security .
but it is only one step of several , " schily told the upper legislative chamber .
but schily added that the real danger does n't come from legally-owned weapons .
he said that attention should now focus on illegally-held guns .
the estimates on how many illegal weapons there are in germany vary considerably .
what is known , however , is that there are 7.2 million legally owned guns in germany .

illegal immigrants at the eurotunnel separating france and england .
germany 's new immigration law is designed to attract highly-qualified workers .
those losing out appear to be asylum seekers , many of whom could go underground rather than face deportation . christopher nsoh had no plans to come to germany .
when you have hours to get out of your country or face death , you don ’ t go through a travel agent anyway .
his trip to europe involved hiding out at a friend ’ s house for a week before getting a spot in the compartment of a ship heading out of cameroon toward germany .
more than a week later , nsoh disembarked in hamburg , skirted the border control and made his way to düsseldorf .
there , he applied for asylum .
that was five years ago .
during that time , the political activist was forced to live in an asylum home near berlin , buy food using the german equivalent of food stamps at a special market and , worst of all , wasn ’ t allowed to work , he said . " i felt myself deteriorating , " said nsoh , 33 , who was a lawyer specializing in international law in cameroon .
fates like nsoh ’ s will hopefully be avoided in the future , if the immigration law passed by germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , ever becomes law .
german president johannes rau signed the bill into law on thursday , but its future remains uncertain .
the conservative opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government on thursday filed suit against the passage of the law in constitutional court .
the christian democratic union says the way in which the law passed upper parliament is unconstitutional .
will asylum-seekers be left in the cold ?
while politicians and lawyers battle over details of what many call a progressive new german immigration law , nsoh is convinced the law hasn ’ t done enough to protect asylum seekers like himself .
the new law seeks to bring in highly-qualified immigrants to come to germany by doing away with a lot of the bureaucratic red tape that kept them from staying here .
in trimming down the byzantine process , the law also promises to speed up the decisions on asylum cases like nsoh ’ s , who is still waiting for a government verdict on his application .

zwei tage vor der mit spannung erwarteten abstimmung über das zuwanderungsgesetz im bundesrat befassen sich die regierungen der ausschlaggebenden länder am dienstag , 19 .
märz 2002 mit dem thema .
in a policy that mirrors the tough talk on asylum seekers and illegal immigrants currently taking place in denmark , italy and britain , the new law also aims to deport those rejected for asylum in a quicker manner .
especially affected are around 250,000 asylum applicants currently " tolerated " by the german government , according to the german lobby group pro asyl .
pushing them into the underground faced with possibility of forced stay in one of the newly-created deportation centers or diving into the underground , advocates fear many will choose the latter .
" people who ’ s lives are threatened will not be able to exploit this law that gives them the right to seek asylum , " said nsoh , who is active in the brandenburg refugee initiative .
" i think the europeans , and the germans in particular , should be careful with such a law , because it ’ s going to portray how discriminative and racist germany and europe is becoming . "
the fiery words are one side of the furious debate taking place at a european summit in seville , spain this weekend .
the other side are countries such as the netherlands , england and germany , who favor tightening the borders to stop the flow of immigrants , both legal and illegal streaming into their countries .
politicians in those countries are feeling the heat of voters flabbergasted that their governments would take on more immigrants in times of high unemployment and overburdened social welfare budgets .
" you see a competition of restrictions for refugees , " said bernd mesovic , of pro asyl .
" it ’ s difficult to see what european country is in front at the moment and which is behind . "

a europe-wide asylum policy , proposed at a summit in tampere , finland in 1999 , will be presented in modified form , but experts say there is likely to be little agreement on it .
in areas like illegal immigration , the eu ’ s member states still prefer to go their own way .
that means a tougher journey for people like nsoh and one more and more likely to be undertaken illegally .
" we were more optimistic of the refugee issue over the past years , " said mesovic .
" but what the european countries and governments have done , especially after the 11th of september is a kind of sabotage .

german president johannes rau on thursday approved a contentious law liberalizing the country 's immigration regulations .
the law now faces a challenge by the opposition conservatives in germany 's highest court . normally , presidential approval of german laws is a mere formality .
but after the conservative opposition union bloc challenged the procedure by which germany 's first-ever immigration bill was passed in the upper legislative chamber in march , the decision became highly political .
thus , all eyes were on rau when he announced his decision to sign the bill into law on thursday .
at a press conference announcing his decision , rau heavily criticized the behavior of germany 's political parties following the vote on the law in the bundesrat .
the vote sparked an unprecedented uproar over proceedural irregularities after representatives from the state of brandenburg in effect cast two conflicting votes .
social democratic state premier manfred stolpe voted " yes , " while his junior coalition partner , interior minister jörg schönbohm of the christian democratic union , voted " no . "
the social democratic president of the bundesrat , klaus wowereit , decided this counted as a " yes " vote , leaving a slim majority in favor of the legislation .
conservatives were outraged by the decision .
on thursday , rau accused stolpe , schönbohm and others involved in the split decision and subsequent salvo slinging of having damaging the reputation of the bundesrat . he said the polemical tenor of the debate following the incident had damaged the public 's image of politics and trust in government institutions .
rau said he approved the law because he did not see any clear case that the vote had violated the constitution .
nevertheless , he said parties on both sides of the debate over the constutional soundness of the vote had " significant reasons " for their conclusions .
for that reason , he said , an examination by the constitutional court of the events surrounding the immigration bill would be " highly desirable . "
the opposition union bloc drew a different analysis of the constitution , saying the conflicting vote should have been nullified .
and immediately after rau announced his decision , thuringia premier berhard vogel , of the opposition christian democrats , sought an injunction against the immigration regulations at the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
meanwhile , the heads of the federal and state parliamentary group leaders of the social democratic party and the greens issued a joint statement lauding rau 's decision .
" we never had any doubt that the law regulating and limiting immigration was achieved in accordance with the constitution , " the statement read .
german chancellor gerhard schröder also supported rau 's move , saying he had " great respect " for the decision as well as the " critical remarks he had made . "
at the same time , he said it was the opposition 's right to sue as much as they saw fit , but that " we will see how the federal constitutional court handles it . "
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , meanwhile , has said that he will seek to overturn the immigation law if he is elected chancellor in september .
stoiber is the joint chancellor candidate for the conservative opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the disputed immigration law has become a major campaign issue in german national elections .

the social democratic president of the bundesrat , klaus wowereit , decided this counted as a " yes " vote , leaving a slim majority in favor of the legislation .
conservatives were outraged by the decision .
on thursday , rau accused stolpe , schönbohm and others involved in the split decision and subsequent salvo slinging of having damaging the reputation of the bundesrat . he said the polemical tenor of the debate following the incident had damaged the public 's image of politics and trust in government institutions .
rau said he approved the law because he did not see any clear case that the vote had violated the constitution .
nevertheless , he said parties on both sides of the debate over the constutional soundness of the vote had " significant reasons " for their conclusions .
for that reason , he said , an examination by the constitutional court of the events surrounding the immigration bill would be " highly desirable . "
the opposition union bloc drew a different analysis of the constitution , saying the conflicting vote should have been nullified .
and immediately after rau announced his decision , thuringia premier berhard vogel , of the opposition christian democrats , sought an injunction against the immigration regulations at the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe .
meanwhile , the heads of the federal and state parliamentary group leaders of the social democratic party and the greens issued a joint statement lauding rau 's decision .
" we never had any doubt that the law regulating and limiting immigration was achieved in accordance with the constitution , " the statement read .
german chancellor gerhard schröder also supported rau 's move , saying he had " great respect " for the decision as well as the " critical remarks he had made . "
at the same time , he said it was the opposition 's right to sue as much as they saw fit , but that " we will see how the federal constitutional court handles it . "
bavarian premier edmund stoiber , meanwhile , has said that he will seek to overturn the immigation law if he is elected chancellor in september .
stoiber is the joint chancellor candidate for the conservative opposition christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the disputed immigration law has become a major campaign issue in german national elections .
the opposition union bloc says immigration must be limited because of the more than four million unemployed germans .
but the government says the country needs to attract highly skilled foreign workers in technology and other sectors in order to make germany more competitive in the global economy . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de immigration : a pressing question in germany collection of reports and stories on immigration to germany disputed immigration law heating up again german president johannes rau is meeting with leaders in brandenburg tuesday to investigate conflicting votes cast in a controversial immigration measure .

the docmorris website has what you need , if you don ’ t mind waiting a few days or alienating german pharmacists . walk into a german pharmacy these days and you ’ re sure to find a petition on the counter and a friendly sales person asking you to sign it .
even if you just want throat lozenges and a pack of tissues , the counter personnel will give you a short speech on why your signature matters .
the german association of pharmacists is collecting signatures for a nation-wide petition to stop the sale of medicine over the internet .
more specifically , their aim is to prevent a particular dutch company from competing in the german market via its online prescription drug service .
docmorris , as the internet pharmacy is called , operates directly across the german border in a small dutch town called landgraaf .
the village , hardly more than a strip of warehouses , is just near enough to the state of north rhine-westphalia in germany to allow german courier services to pick up parcels and deliver them cheaply across the border , and just far enough to be out of the scope of the german law banning online drug services .
and it ’ s this combination that makes landgraaf the ideal location for docmorris ’ s cross-border pharmaceutical business .
cross-border drug trade the company ’ s concept is simple and clear-cut .
internet users in germany and the netherlands log onto the docmorris.de website and submit their prescription drug request .
if the medication is in stock , the user can fill out an order form and a packaging label with address information .
within a week a courier service delivers the medication directly to the customer .
docmorris has flourished in its first two years of existence .
starting out in june 2000 , with only four employees and an average of five prescription requests a day , the company has blossomed into a major enterprise with 75 employees and thousands of customer orders a day .
last year it grossed five million euro -lrb- $ 4.78 million -rrb- in sales , and in the first quarter of this year the company cleared 3.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.35 million -rrb- .
three-quarters of the company ’ s customers are from germany .
the dutch-german connection is the key to docmorris ’ success .
not only is parcel delivery made cheaper by the close proximity to the german customers , but the price for drugs at the dutch company is considerably lower than across the border in germany .
the netherlands have no set prices for medication , no anti-competition laws for pharmacists , no prescription fees and no distribution monopoly .
prescription drugs are on average10 to 15 percent cheaper in the netherlands .
viagra , one of docmorris ’ more popular prescription requests , is a full 18 euro cheaper than at a german pharmacy .
ralf däinghaus , founding father of docmorris , recently told the financial times germany newspaper online pharmacy is growing in popularity among germans because it offers something their local pharmacies do not : prescription filling in the comfort and privacy of one ’ s own home .
an internet user is neither restricted by the opening hours of a pharmacy nor hindered by distance to it .
ordering a prescription online also saves the customer a potentially embarrassing trip to the pharmacy , where he or she might run into a person they know .
the anonymity of ordering prescriptions online is a clear benefit for the customer , says däinghaus .
online drug trade but what many see as an improvement in terms of ease of access , anonymity and cheaper prices , is being criticized by german pharmacists as a risk to patient ’ s heath and a violation of consumer protection laws .
in germany , there is a ban on mail order pharmaceutical services including the filling of prescription drug orders over the internet .
the law was established in 1998 to protect the consumer from unreliable pharmaceutical operations .
the primary concern was that online drug did not fall under the auspices of federal german regulations which monitor the production , storage and distribution of medicine .
according to the law , prescription medication can only be handed out in the sales rooms of pharmacies .
hence , an internet drug company , especially a foreign one , is illegal .
in this regard germany is going against the tide of technology .
since the 1998 law was passed , internet pharmacies have popped up throughout the world wide web .
a simple search in google.com produces 500,000 entries for online drug companies .
although some of the internet companies are dubious , the majority of the online pharmacies have improved their reputation as more and more patients order prescription drugs from them .
over the last few months , federal health minister ulla schmidt has criticized the ban on online pharmacies as outdated and no longer feasible .
" we can not build a wall around germany " to keep out the internet drug providers , she said when the subject first came up for discussion in her ministry .
the german pharmacists , however , want to make sure that the law stays on the books .
thomas preis , head of the north-rhine westphalia association of pharmacists urged the government to maintain the ban on internet pharmacies " in the interest of patients and consumer protection . "
preis criticized internet pharmacies for delivering medication too late and without the necessary prescription counseling .
these unreliable practices " endanger the successful healing therapy of the patient , " he said .
last year , the german association of pharmacists took docmorris to court and won a temporary injunction against the dutch internet company .
their case was based on the violation of german pharmaceutical trade law .
but docmorris still exists and is protected against such legal actions by dutch and european union laws which permit online drug companies as long as the provider is a recognized pharmacist .
money for medication the underlying issue at stake in the dispute is more about money than safe distribution of drugs .
last year the german health insurance companies spent 22.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 21.4 billion -rrb- on prescription drugs .
one third of that money flowed back into the hands of large pharmaceutical distributors and the individual pharmacies .
the pharmaceutical trade law of 1998 virtually guarantees pharmacists a hefty profit margin on all medication handed out to patients .
the law allows pharmacist to place a 27 percent handling fee on top of the wholesale price for a prescription drug .
for more expensive medication , the profit margin can go up to as much as 40 percent .
that ’ s a lot of money for the pharmacists , and it ’ s no wonder they ’ re concerned about the dutch internet competition .
the online pharmacies are cutting into their profits .
studies by the bavarian ministry for social welfare show that if the online pharmacies were to gain just five percent of the german market , 20 to 30 percent of pharmacies in germany would have to shut down over loss of sales .
bavaria is the only state in germany to have come out in favor of banning online drug providers .
the rest of the country , including the federal health ministry , has considered lifting the ban as a way to save money and provide patients with an alternative to traditional pharmacies .
affordable medication or consumer protection ?
german health insurance companies are behind the online drug providers .
they ’ ve calculated that approximately three billion euro -lrb- $ 2.87 billion -rrb- could be saved annually by allowing their insurance holders to order drugs online .
reimbursing patients for the money they spend filling prescriptions online is considerably cheaper than paying the higher price at german pharmacies .
german pharmacists criticize such market-based thinking .
the north-rhine westphalia association of pharmacists is concerned that the needs of the patient will be overlooked if the german government and health care providers focus on the issue from a " purely financially-motivated standpoint and not from the perspective of providing quality individual patient care " .
pro pharmacy the federal association of pharmacists recently launched a nation-wide petition called " pro apotheke " -lrb- pro pharmacy -rrb- .
through the collection of signatures , the pharmacists hope to show the government that the german consumer is on the pharmacies ’ side in banning internet drug providers .
the pharmacists stress that permitting online pharmacies would lead to a decline in available service , a closing of local pharmacies , an elimination of individual counseling , and an increase of risk to the patient .
so far their petition has only managed to increase awareness of the online pharmacies .
while many customers have willingly signed the petition , others have learned for the first time about the possibility of filling prescription orders online .
and even the government has begun to consider a compromise solution .
pro internet for docmorris and other online pharmacies , the debate in germany is money to their ears .
the more the subject comes up in the news , the more german customers find their way to the company ’ s website to order medication .
" thanks to the court cases , we don ’ t have to pay a single penny for advertisement .
we couldn ’ t have bought a better marketing campaign , " ralf däinghaus told financial times germany .
" if we were sitting in germany , we wouldn ’ t have been nearly so successful .
docmorris profits from the inflexibility of the german market . "
just a kilometer a way from docmorris , a second dutch internet pharmacy is getting ready to open for business with an eye for the growing german market .
and in the last month , the german association of pharmacists launched its own website , aponet.de.
currently , the site only allows customers to pre-order a prescription , not to have it filled and mailed .

they ’ ve calculated that approximately three billion euro -lrb- $ 2.87 billion -rrb- could be saved annually by allowing their insurance holders to order drugs online .
reimbursing patients for the money they spend filling prescriptions online is considerably cheaper than paying the higher price at german pharmacies .
german pharmacists criticize such market-based thinking .
the north-rhine westphalia association of pharmacists is concerned that the needs of the patient will be overlooked if the german government and health care providers focus on the issue from a " purely financially-motivated standpoint and not from the perspective of providing quality individual patient care " .
pro pharmacy the federal association of pharmacists recently launched a nation-wide petition called " pro apotheke " -lrb- pro pharmacy -rrb- .
through the collection of signatures , the pharmacists hope to show the government that the german consumer is on the pharmacies ’ side in banning internet drug providers .
the pharmacists stress that permitting online pharmacies would lead to a decline in available service , a closing of local pharmacies , an elimination of individual counseling , and an increase of risk to the patient .
so far their petition has only managed to increase awareness of the online pharmacies .
while many customers have willingly signed the petition , others have learned for the first time about the possibility of filling prescription orders online .
and even the government has begun to consider a compromise solution .
pro internet for docmorris and other online pharmacies , the debate in germany is money to their ears .
the more the subject comes up in the news , the more german customers find their way to the company ’ s website to order medication .
" thanks to the court cases , we don ’ t have to pay a single penny for advertisement .
we couldn ’ t have bought a better marketing campaign , " ralf däinghaus told financial times germany .
" if we were sitting in germany , we wouldn ’ t have been nearly so successful .
docmorris profits from the inflexibility of the german market . "
just a kilometer a way from docmorris , a second dutch internet pharmacy is getting ready to open for business with an eye for the growing german market .
and in the last month , the german association of pharmacists launched its own website , aponet.de.

the docmorris website has what you need , if you don ’ t mind waiting a few days or alienating german pharmacists . walk into a german pharmacy these days and you ’ re sure to find a petition on the counter and a friendly sales person asking you to sign it .
even if you just want throat lozenges and a pack of tissues , the counter personnel will give you a short speech on why your signature matters .
the german association of pharmacists is collecting signatures for a nation-wide petition to stop the sale of medicine over the internet .
more specifically , their aim is to prevent a particular dutch company from competing in the german market via its online prescription drug service .
docmorris , as the internet pharmacy is called , operates directly across the german border in a small dutch town called landgraaf .
the village , hardly more than a strip of warehouses , is just near enough to the state of north rhine-westphalia in germany to allow german courier services to pick up parcels and deliver them cheaply across the border , and just far enough to be out of the scope of the german law banning online drug services .
and it ’ s this combination that makes landgraaf the ideal location for docmorris ’ s cross-border pharmaceutical business .
cross-border drug trade the company ’ s concept is simple and clear-cut .
internet users in germany and the netherlands log onto the docmorris.de website and submit their prescription drug request .
if the medication is in stock , the user can fill out an order form and a packaging label with address information .
within a week a courier service delivers the medication directly to the customer .
docmorris has flourished in its first two years of existence .
starting out in june 2000 , with only four employees and an average of five prescription requests a day , the company has blossomed into a major enterprise with 75 employees and thousands of customer orders a day .
last year it grossed five million euro -lrb- $ 4.78 million -rrb- in sales , and in the first quarter of this year the company cleared 3.5 million euro -lrb- $ 3.35 million -rrb- .
three-quarters of the company ’ s customers are from germany .
the dutch-german connection is the key to docmorris ’ success .
not only is parcel delivery made cheaper by the close proximity to the german customers , but the price for drugs at the dutch company is considerably lower than across the border in germany .
the netherlands have no set prices for medication , no anti-competition laws for pharmacists , no prescription fees and no distribution monopoly .
prescription drugs are on average10 to 15 percent cheaper in the netherlands .
viagra , one of docmorris ’ more popular prescription requests , is a full 18 euro cheaper than at a german pharmacy .
ralf däinghaus , founding father of docmorris , recently told the financial times germany newspaper online pharmacy is growing in popularity among germans because it offers something their local pharmacies do not : prescription filling in the comfort and privacy of one ’ s own home .
an internet user is neither restricted by the opening hours of a pharmacy nor hindered by distance to it .
ordering a prescription online also saves the customer a potentially embarrassing trip to the pharmacy , where he or she might run into a person they know .
the anonymity of ordering prescriptions online is a clear benefit for the customer , says däinghaus .
online drug trade but what many see as an improvement in terms of ease of access , anonymity and cheaper prices , is being criticized by german pharmacists as a risk to patient ’ s heath and a violation of consumer protection laws .
in germany , there is a ban on mail order pharmaceutical services including the filling of prescription drug orders over the internet .
the law was established in 1998 to protect the consumer from unreliable pharmaceutical operations .
the primary concern was that online drug did not fall under the auspices of federal german regulations which monitor the production , storage and distribution of medicine .
according to the law , prescription medication can only be handed out in the sales rooms of pharmacies .
hence , an internet drug company , especially a foreign one , is illegal .
in this regard germany is going against the tide of technology .
since the 1998 law was passed , internet pharmacies have popped up throughout the world wide web .
a simple search in google.com produces 500,000 entries for online drug companies .
although some of the internet companies are dubious , the majority of the online pharmacies have improved their reputation as more and more patients order prescription drugs from them .
over the last few months , federal health minister ulla schmidt has criticized the ban on online pharmacies as outdated and no longer feasible .
" we can not build a wall around germany " to keep out the internet drug providers , she said when the subject first came up for discussion in her ministry .
the german pharmacists , however , want to make sure that the law stays on the books .
thomas preis , head of the north-rhine westphalia association of pharmacists urged the government to maintain the ban on internet pharmacies " in the interest of patients and consumer protection . "
preis criticized internet pharmacies for delivering medication too late and without the necessary prescription counseling .
these unreliable practices " endanger the successful healing therapy of the patient , " he said .
last year , the german association of pharmacists took docmorris to court and won a temporary injunction against the dutch internet company .
their case was based on the violation of german pharmaceutical trade law .
but docmorris still exists and is protected against such legal actions by dutch and european union laws which permit online drug companies as long as the provider is a recognized pharmacist .
money for medication the underlying issue at stake in the dispute is more about money than safe distribution of drugs .
last year the german health insurance companies spent 22.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 21.4 billion -rrb- on prescription drugs .
one third of that money flowed back into the hands of large pharmaceutical distributors and the individual pharmacies .
the pharmaceutical trade law of 1998 virtually guarantees pharmacists a hefty profit margin on all medication handed out to patients .
the law allows pharmacist to place a 27 percent handling fee on top of the wholesale price for a prescription drug .
for more expensive medication , the profit margin can go up to as much as 40 percent .
that ’ s a lot of money for the pharmacists , and it ’ s no wonder they ’ re concerned about the dutch internet competition .
the online pharmacies are cutting into their profits .
studies by the bavarian ministry for social welfare show that if the online pharmacies were to gain just five percent of the german market , 20 to 30 percent of pharmacies in germany would have to shut down over loss of sales .
bavaria is the only state in germany to have come out in favor of banning online drug providers .
the rest of the country , including the federal health ministry , has considered lifting the ban as a way to save money and provide patients with an alternative to traditional pharmacies .

illegal immigrants at the eurotunnel separating france and england .
germany 's new immigration law is designed to attract highly-qualified workers .
those losing out appear to be asylum seekers , many of whom could go underground rather than face deportation . christopher nsoh had no plans to come to germany .
when you have hours to get out of your country or face death , you don ’ t go through a travel agent anyway .
his trip to europe involved hiding out at a friend ’ s house for a week before getting a spot in the compartment of a ship heading out of cameroon toward germany .
more than a week later , nsoh disembarked in hamburg , skirted the border control and made his way to düsseldorf .
there , he applied for asylum .
that was five years ago .
during that time , the political activist was forced to live in an asylum home near berlin , buy food using the german equivalent of food stamps at a special market and , worst of all , wasn ’ t allowed to work , he said . " i felt myself deteriorating , " said nsoh , 33 , who was a lawyer specializing in international law in cameroon .
fates like nsoh ’ s will hopefully be avoided in the future , if the immigration law passed by germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , ever becomes law .
german president johannes rau signed the bill into law on thursday , but its future remains uncertain .
the conservative opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government on thursday filed suit against the passage of the law in constitutional court .
the christian democratic union says the way in which the law passed upper parliament is unconstitutional .
will asylum-seekers be left in the cold ?
while politicians and lawyers battle over details of what many call a progressive new german immigration law , nsoh is convinced the law hasn ’ t done enough to protect asylum seekers like himself .
the new law seeks to bring in highly-qualified immigrants to come to germany by doing away with a lot of the bureaucratic red tape that kept them from staying here .
in trimming down the byzantine process , the law also promises to speed up the decisions on asylum cases like nsoh ’ s , who is still waiting for a government verdict on his application .

in a policy that mirrors the tough talk on asylum seekers and illegal immigrants currently taking place in denmark , italy and britain , the new law also aims to deport those rejected for asylum in a quicker manner .

the fiery words are one side of the furious debate taking place at a european summit in seville , spain this weekend .
the other side are countries such as the netherlands , england and germany , who favor tightening the borders to stop the flow of immigrants , both legal and illegal streaming into their countries .

the european union commission on thursday said it would be launching a probe into germany 's so-called vw law , the special regulation that effectively protects car maker volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover . the european court recently banned the use of " golden shares " in former state-owned companies .
now the european commission is looking into other mechanisms through which governments can intervene in the takeover process , and lower saxony ’ s special rights within volkswagen are high on its list .
the european union commission on thursday said it would be launching a probe into germany 's so-called vw law , the special regulation that effectively protects car maker volkswagen ag from a hostile takeover .
a spokesman for internal market commissioner frits bolkestein said that his office would be examining the vw law " very carefully " .
meanwhile , chancellor gerhard schröder categorically rejected the idea of any change in the vw law .
schröder told a meeting of the vw works council : " under my leadership , there will be no alterations to this law in germany , and we will fight anybody who tries , via the european union , to get a change of this kind introduced . "
when he was premier of the german state of lower saxony , schröder had a seat on the vw supervisory board .
lower saxony 's government owns just under 20 % of vw 's shares , and a special regulation prevents any other shareholder from controlling more than 20 % of the company 's voting rights .
that regulation made volkswagen the only german company to enjoy the kind of protection afforded the french former state-owned firms by the " golden share " mechanism .
and it 's a recent landmark ruling by the european court of justice , effectively banning the use of golden shares , that has led bolkestein to look into other ways in which governments within europe have secured themselves the right to intervene in the takeover process .
along with the vw law , nine other similar arrangements are up for review , said the commissioner 's spokesman .
over one year ago , a british investor group lodged a complaint in brussels against the vw law .

illegal immigrants at the eurotunnel separating france and england .
germany 's new immigration law is designed to attract highly-qualified workers .
those losing out appear to be asylum seekers , many of whom could go underground rather than face deportation . christopher nsoh had no plans to come to germany .
when you have hours to get out of your country or face death , you don ’ t go through a travel agent anyway .
his trip to europe involved hiding out at a friend ’ s house for a week before getting a spot in the compartment of a ship heading out of cameroon toward germany .
more than a week later , nsoh disembarked in hamburg , skirted the border control and made his way to düsseldorf .
there , he applied for asylum .
that was five years ago .
during that time , the political activist was forced to live in an asylum home near berlin , buy food using the german equivalent of food stamps at a special market and , worst of all , wasn ’ t allowed to work , he said . " i felt myself deteriorating , " said nsoh , 33 , who was a lawyer specializing in international law in cameroon .
fates like nsoh ’ s will hopefully be avoided in the future , if the immigration law passed by germany ’ s upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , ever becomes law .
german president johannes rau signed the bill into law on thursday , but its future remains uncertain .
the conservative opposition to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government on thursday filed suit against the passage of the law in constitutional court .
the christian democratic union says the way in which the law passed upper parliament is unconstitutional .
will asylum-seekers be left in the cold ?
while politicians and lawyers battle over details of what many call a progressive new german immigration law , nsoh is convinced the law hasn ’ t done enough to protect asylum seekers like himself .
the new law seeks to bring in highly-qualified immigrants to come to germany by doing away with a lot of the bureaucratic red tape that kept them from staying here .
in trimming down the byzantine process , the law also promises to speed up the decisions on asylum cases like nsoh ’ s , who is still waiting for a government verdict on his application .

in a policy that mirrors the tough talk on asylum seekers and illegal immigrants currently taking place in denmark , italy and britain , the new law also aims to deport those rejected for asylum in a quicker manner .
especially affected are around 250,000 asylum applicants currently " tolerated " by the german government , according to the german lobby group pro asyl .

the supplements sold by superdrug and holland & barrett were found to have higher levels of dioxin and dioxin-like pcbs than others brands .
the food standards agency -lrb- fsa -rrb- asked both the firms to remove the fish oil from sale .
it said the capsules contained more than twice the recommended daily intake .
two batches the affected products are : superdrug pure cod liver oil , bottled 300ml , expiry april 2003 ; batch number 300909 holland & barrett pure cod liver oil , bottled 250ml , expiry august 2002 ; batch number lo229 dioxins and pcbs are potentially cancer-causing chemicals which are present in the environment and food .
they are not harmful to health immediately but the concern is over the damage done by long-term exposure to high levels . "
we think it 's unlikely that any stocks of the relevant batches remain " holland & barrett the fsa tested 33 samples of branded fish oil supplement on sale across the uk .
most of the dioxin levels found were low , apart from the two recommended for withdrawal from sale .
new eu-wide dioxin limits come into force from 1 july and will be enforced by local authorities .
safeguards dr jon bell , the fsa 's deputy chief executive and head of food safety , said : " while there have been measurable improvements in dioxin levels in fish oil supplements , there is scope for additional action by the fish oil supplement industry to reduce levels still further .
" the agency has initiated discussions with retailers and industry about ways to continue to reduce levels of potentially harmful dioxins in fish oil supplements . "
both holland & barrett and superdrug said they were taking the fsa 's advice and removing the product from their shelves .
a spokeswoman for holland & barrett said the samples in question were bought between october 2000 and october 2001 .
' still beneficial ' " we think it 's unlikely that any stocks of the relevant batches remain .
" nevertheless , as a precautionary measure , we immediately implemented a recall from all our stores .
" we also carried out a general review of product labelling , particularly with reference to levels of recommended doses for children of different ages and adults . "
the health supplements information service -lrb- hsis -rrb- , an independent information service established to provide balanced advice and guidance on the use of food supplements , welcomed the report .
but the organisation stressed that fish oil supplements were still beneficial .
derek shrimpton , nutritional advisor to the hsis , said : " fish oil supplements are taken in very small quantities and therefore greatly limit any exposure to dioxins and pcbs . "

the company generated net profits of just 862m yen -lrb- $ 7m ; £ 4.7m -rrb- in the year to march , after writing off 832bn yen on its overseas investments .
in an attempt to regain the initiative , the company used its annual general meeting on friday to announce plans for both the home and overseas markets , including wireless data services in tokyo and i-mode services in taiwan .
still , shareholders used the agm - customarily a quiet , orderly occasion though on previous occasions it has been infiltrated by gangster blackmailers - to make their anger known .
the overall effect was to depress ntt docomo 's stock 3 % to 285,000 yen .
outspoken " i do n't think the management has taken full responsibility , " one investor said to applause .
" i spent my retirement money to buy six shares .
i 've lost so much . "
his dissatisfaction seemed widely shared , an index of yet more damage done to the telecoms world from the hubris of the 1990s .
docomo was the iconic mobile operator during the boom years , capturing more than 50 % of its home market and then adventuring overseas with minority " strategic " stakes in a range of operators around the world .
its i-mode mobile data service is one of the few really successful ventures of its kind .
but the minority foreign investments have plummeted in value while failing to allow any management control .
and the expensive rollout of 3g services has so far been something of a bust , with rival kddi 's equivalent offering grabbing three times as many customers .
off target both at home and abroad , the result had been complacency , shareholders charged .
" it looks to me as if docomo has become too content with its dominant position in the market , " one said .
the company acknowledged problems , but fought back .
" it 's necessary to make overseas investments to cope with the globalisation of the mobile phone market , " vice president yoshinori uda said .
" we will continue investments otherwise we wo n't be able to survive and may miss a growth opportunity . "

the deal means the focus of the summit will return to asylum , and arguments between member states over the rights and wrongs of a common policy on refugees .
meetings to settle the squabble over france 's deficit stretched into the early hours .
the result was a compromise : while the european union 's 1997 growth and stability pact requires all countries to bring their budgets into balance by 2004 , france will be exempt unless growth in both 2003 and 2004 tops 3 % .
this is double the growth rate that france is forecast to have this year .
tax cuts the argument which led to thursday 's deal was triggered by an audit , commissioned by france 's new right-wing administration , which showed the country 's 2002 's deficit growing to 2.5 % of gross domestic product .
as well as being far in excess of the government 's own 1.9 % prediction , the figure is dangerously close to the 3 % ceiling built into the pact .
and it leaves little space for the tax cuts promised by the incoming government .
france 's new finance minister made it clear that his colleagues had accepted france 's arguments .
" if we do n't have this growth , we will all have to accept to push things back by - who knows ? - a year or two years , " francis mer told reporters .
damage the pact was put in place to tame national deficits in an effort to combat inflation and build investor confidence in the new euro currency .
portugal , which looks set to narrowly avoid breaching the 3 % deficit limit this year , joined france in pushing for greater flexibility .
there were concerns that some eu countries were not doing enough to bring their budget deficits under control even before france began pressing for a relaxation of the stability pact .
earlier this week , the european commission said in a report that eurozone economic powerhouses france and germany , along with italy and portugal , were in danger of missing the 2004 deadline .
the budget squabbles have not so far affected the euro , which rose to a two-year high against the dollar on thursday .
ecb sounds the alarm the prospect of a relaxation of the stability pact prompted criticism from officials at the european central bank , which sets monetary policy for the eurozone area independently of national governments .
an increase in european governments ' budget deficits could fuel inflationary pressures , putting the ecb under added pressure push through growth-sapping interest rate increases .
nout wellink , a member of the ecb 's interest rate-setting governing council , said on thursday that ministers should avoid loosening the agreed spending constraints at a time when the economic downturn is subjecting them to their first real test .
" i think -lrb- proposals to relax the stability pact -rrb- are a very unfortunate development , and i hope ministers will stay away from them , " he told the reuters news agency .
" it is the first test , and at the first test you should n't change things , " he said .

click here to e-mail us with your thoughts breakfast heard from one father who had went to two tribunals , to get a place at a special school for his autistic son .
adrian phillips ' son james spent 18 months out of school completely - and now travels 35 miles each way every day , to a specialist school for autistic children .
" the problem is finances , " adrian told breakfast . " the law is quite clear but local authorities break it because they want to keep their budgets in line . "
adrian , who lives in newport in gwent , had to threaten his local authority with further action in the high court , before a promised school place for his son finally materialised .
" the audit commission does not realise how important the legislation is in protecting the rights of parents and children , " he said .
" the system should penalise local authorities who break the law . "
background the report , by the public services watchdog , the audit commission , calls for a " high-level , independent review " of the system in england and wales .
its report deals with what are known as " statements " of special educational need .
the report says many children and their families are having poor and stressful experiences .
it will be followed in the autumn by a fuller report , looking at how well children 's needs are being met in view of the government policy of putting more of those with special needs into mainstream schools .
how it works this interim report involved research in five education authorities , with a review of the files on 100 children .
it says one in five children has some form of special educational need , ranging from mild dyslexia to behavioural problems to complex medical conditions .
in most cases this is dealt with in schools .
but some need more support than their school can provide .
for these children , the local authority draws up a statement of special educational needs , which in most cases provides extra help of some kind in the school .
just over 3 % of children in england and wales have a statement .
lottery the commission says a statement takes six months to produce and costs an estimated £ 2,500 - but often it adds little in helping to meet a child 's needs , according to parents and teachers .
many parents found this assessment a stressful and alienating process - most of those met by the research team said they " had to fight " to get a statement .
children with similar needs are getting different levels of support depending on where they live , which school they go to and how assertive their parents are , the report says .
there is only a weak link between the number of statements in an area and how deprived the area is .
but even when they get a statement it provided little guarantee that their child will get the support they need , the report says .
what to do this is blamed on weak monitoring arrangements in many authorities and schools , and shortfalls in some health and social services for children .
the commission has 12 recommendations .
they include devolving more resources to schools so they can intervene at the earliest opportunity with a view to meeting more children 's needs without having to request a statutory assessment .
with this , there should be " rigorous monitoring arrangements " so parents can be confident their child will get the support he or she needs .
tensions the government has made a number of changes , including a new code of practice and the special educational needs and disability act 2001 .
" these represent steps in the right direction - but tensions remain at the heart of the statutory framework , " says the report .
the controller of the audit commission , sir andrew foster , said there was much local authorities and schools could do to help meet children 's needs more effectively .
but action at a local level could only go so far .
" our system of education has changed enormously since statements were first introduced , nearly 20 years ago .
" much progress has been made in that time , " he said .
review " however key parts of the statutory framework are inconsistent with the roles now played by local authorities , schools and other agencies in meeting children 's needs .
" we therefore urge the government to establish a high level independent review - to pave the way for a system that is fairer , more efficient and more responsive to the needs of young people and their families . "
a spokesperson for the department for education said the new code of practice encouraged earlier identification of children 's needs and there was stronger , school-based provision to meet them .
there was £ 91m for next year for such things as training - five times the amount available in 1997-98 .

the national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- has also found the uk government was warned about the disease two years prior to the outbreak and should have done more to combat the threat .
sir john bourn confirmed the outbreak in wales cost the government £ 102m , while it cost for britain as a whole reached £ 8bn .
disease in wales 70,000 slaughters on infected premises 216,000 slaughters due to dangerous contact 833,000 slaughters for welfare reasons cost to defra : £ 102m average farm clean-up : £ 44,000 loss to producers : £ 65m loss to food industry : £ 25m cost to uk private sector : £ 5bn total lost uk gdp : 0.2 % six million animals were slaughtered in the crisis , which the nao says cost the government £ 3bn and tourism and the rural economy more than £ 5bn .
sir john said a more thorough contingency plan was needed to allow better preparation for any future outbreak .
farmers ' union of wales leader bob parry , who contributed to the nao report and criticised the handling of the outbreak , said he felt vindicated .
" the fuw has consistently argued that the contingency plan in force for last year 's outbreak was hopelessly inadequate , " he said in a statement .
" the union submitted evidence to the nao pointing out the apparent total lack of contingency planning to deal with a disease on this scale .
" the fuw also expressed concern over an apparent lack of communication between government departments in london and cardiff assigned to tackle the disease .
" the government 's initial response was slow , allowing the disease to spread throughout the country . "
auditors criticise uk disease planning the report reads : " in many areas , the resources needed to deal with the disease rapidly went beyond what had been envisaged in contingency plans . "
carmarthen east and dinefwr am rhodri glyn thomas welcomed the publication of the report , and was critical of the gaps in protection measures .
hundreds of thousands of animals were culled " because of a lack of a contingency plan , the minister and officials at the assembly were in crisis management from day one , " he said .

the national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- has also found the uk government was warned about the disease two years prior to the outbreak and should have done more to combat the threat .
sir john bourn confirmed the outbreak in wales cost the government £ 102m , while it cost for britain as a whole reached £ 8bn .
disease in wales 70,000 slaughters on infected premises 216,000 slaughters due to dangerous contact 833,000 slaughters for welfare reasons cost to defra : £ 102m average farm clean-up : £ 44,000 loss to producers : £ 65m loss to food industry : £ 25m cost to uk private sector : £ 5bn total lost uk gdp : 0.2 % six million animals were slaughtered in the crisis , which the nao says cost the government £ 3bn and tourism and the rural economy more than £ 5bn .
sir john said a more thorough contingency plan was needed to allow better preparation for any future outbreak .
farmers ' union of wales leader bob parry , who contributed to the nao report and criticised the handling of the outbreak , said he felt vindicated .
" the fuw has consistently argued that the contingency plan in force for last year 's outbreak was hopelessly inadequate , " he said in a statement .
" the union submitted evidence to the nao pointing out the apparent total lack of contingency planning to deal with a disease on this scale .
" the fuw also expressed concern over an apparent lack of communication between government departments in london and cardiff assigned to tackle the disease .
" the government 's initial response was slow , allowing the disease to spread throughout the country . "
the report reads : " in many areas , the resources needed to deal with the disease rapidly went beyond what had been envisaged in contingency plans . "
carmarthen east and dinefwr am rhodri glyn thomas welcomed the publication of the report , and was critical of the gaps in protection measures .
" because of a lack of a contingency plan , the minister and officials at the assembly were in crisis management from day one , " he said .
" there was no opportunity to take a strategic view of the situation - no real consideration given to any other response other than destroying any animal suspected of being in contact . "

credit rating agency moody 's - which assesses the ability of borrowers to repay their debt - cut its outlook on brazilian government debt to " negative " and fitch 's downgraded its rating as well .
stocks tumbled and the currency , the real , slumped in value .
both agencies noted that the problem was a matter of sentiment : october elections could gift the presidency to a socialist , lula da silva , and that - they believe - could undermine investor confidence in the stability of brazil 's debt .
lower ratings effectively mean that borrowers have to pay higher interest rates - to compensate lenders for the perceived greater risk of default .
all in all , the criticism was not the best of news in a fiercely superstitious country less than a day away from a key world cup clash on friday morning against england .
sentiment the government , unsurprisingly , played down the doubts .
" the brazilian economy is solid , democracy stable and we live in a climate of economic tranquillity , " vice president marcos maciel told reporters .
and analysts agreed that the country was being caught in the backwash of worries about emerging markets , rather than suffering because of real economic fundamentals .
" the sensation is that market dynamics are starting to create credit dynamics , and not the other way around , " said mark siegel , emerging markets fund manager at dl babson & co .
" if that 's the case , then brazil 's challenge will be harder to manage than most of the market is prepared for . "
new man certainly the challenge looked genuine on thursday , as the rio stock market slid more than 5 % , the worst one-day fall since 13 september .
at the same time , the real slipped 7 centavos to close at 2.77 , despite massive government intervention .
and the yield on brazil 's government bonds - the premium promised buyers to persuade them to invest - shot up 10 % .
the market worry is that if lula da silva gets in october - and current polls show him with twice the 19 % garnered by the government 's candidate - renegotiation of brazil 's $ 90bn debt will be high on the agenda .
" renegotiation " is taken in some quarters to mean default , following eight years of heavy spending and a consequently ballooning deficit .

twenty-four miners have been rescued after the blast in the town of jixi in heilongjiang province on thursday morning .
they are now in hospital , although none are said to be in a serious condition .
it has been an anxious wait for the miners ' families after the explosion , china 's state coal mine safety bureau ordered an immediate halt to production at 10 mines in the town , which suffered two other mine blasts in april .
a bbc correspondent in beijing , rupert wingfield-hayes , says that anywhere else in the world , thursday 's blast would have been a shocking event , but in china it is just another statistic .
china has the most dangerous coal mining industry in the world , and despite efforts to improve safety , about 5,000 miners died in accidents last year .
rescue operation " we know where the four missing people are and we 're trying very hard to rescue them , " said zhao tiechui , deputy director of the china 's work safety administration .
according to the official xinhua news agency , 60 bodies of those killed have been recovered .
the mines in jixi have been closed down so that they can be inspected and the cause of the blast determined .
but our correspondent says that such investigations do little to get to the root of the problem with china 's coal mines .
chronic under-investment decades of under-investment have left china 's mines decrepit .
few mines have modern ventilation systems to extract the volatile coal gases that build up in the underground shafts and tunnels .
a spark is all that is needed to set off a huge explosion .
nearly 1,000 people were killed in just the first three months of this year and there is reported to be growing public outrage in the country at the stream of deaths .
china announced in april that it will close 8,000 small coal mines as part of efforts to streamline and regulate the industry .
but mines which are shut are often then re-opened with the support of local authorities , anxious for their profits .

nhs trusts for swansea , cardiff and the vale of glamorgan are warning local general practitioners that appointments could be cancelled if patients do not reply to their letters .
under pressure to cut hospital waiting times , the bodies are undertaking an administrative review by writing to people to check they wish to remain on the list .
two letters are being sent to some patients if there is no reply after a second letter , the trusts will contact their gps who must then check their patients ' requirements .
but doctors are angry that more paperwork is being passed onto them , and have said it should not be the job of hard-pressed medics to do the work for the hospitals .
the " validation " move has come about in a attempt to cut waiting lists by removing people who no longer require treatment .
but some family doctors have complained that the new initiatives will add to their heavy workload and it is thought patients frustrated by long waits could be offended by the check .
' patient fury ' morgannwg local medical committee secretary ian millington told the british medical journal : " writing to the patient itself creates a certain amount of fury .
" if you have been waiting a year for treatment and then get a letter from the trust asking whether you still want to be treated , you will be less than happy .
someone has to chase the patients ian millington " we have no problems with the thinking behind the trust 's policy , but i do n't think it should be left to the gp to do the work .
" someone has to chase the patients ... we do n't have the staff to do it .
it seems to be another case of extra work being dumped on to gps . "
patient offended robin williams from swansea , who is awaiting thoratic treatment , said he felt offended by the letter .
" i felt like i was a cheat , falsifying my illness - they are trying to intimidate people to cancelling operations or going private , " he said .
" i would urge -lsb- patients -rsb- to remain calm , do n't get upset .
send it back within the time period . "
swansea nhs trust corporate development director andrew bellamy said he was trying to keep records up-to-date and provide a better service , eliminating resource wastage .
he admitted patients will have often moved and miss the letters but , he said , gps would still know how to contact them .
there have been no official complaints from patients , and he said the checks would keep " unnecessary " waiting list additions to a minimum . watch / listen on this story robin williams " i felt offended " see also : 16 may 02 -pipe- health q & a : nhs waiting lists 28 may 02 -pipe- wales hutt urged to explain cancelled ops 20 feb 02 -pipe- health waiting lists top public concern 03 may 02 -pipe- wales heart patients ' die ' on waiting lists 24 apr 02 -pipe- wales nhs waiting times fall 15 mar 02 -pipe- wales inquiry into nine-year operation wait 20 feb 02 -pipe- wales patients set nhs priorities 30 jan 02 -pipe- wales patients wait longer for ward space 26 sep 01 -pipe- wales waiting lists ' double ' under labour internet links : welsh assembly iechyd morgannwg health authority swansea nhs trust cardiff and vale nhs trust nhs wales waiting times nhs wales bro taf health authority the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : boyfriend sought in murder inquiry girl will wait for jailed ' rapist ' lover cash boost for brecon jazz hello !

we are not against inclusion where appropriate but those who are in dean hall are there because they have failed in mainstream mother they say the drive to have such vulnerable youngsters in mainstream education could damage them .
the council says the evidence is that the children will benefit from the change .
other areas are making similar moves - it is government policy to have greater " inclusion " , and it is the tendency across western europe .
but gloucestershire stands out because historically it has had a relatively high number of special schools .
closure pending there are four schools for children with the most severe learning difficulties and they will remain , although one is to be replaced with a new building on a new site .
gloucestershire plan four schools for moderate learning difficulties to shut closure of one agreed already campaigners fighting proposals ofsted critical of strategy there is also a multi-purpose centre for moderate , severe and physical difficulties , which is over-subscribed .
what the council wants to do is to shut its four centres for those with what are deemed to be moderate problems .
the closure of one has been agreed .
the notice is about to be published for another , dean hall in coleford , with a closure date of august 2003 .
dean hall is attended by 61 youngsters - including gillian dovey 's daughter , laura .
" she has a chronological age of 15 but an age of nine or 10 academically , " she said .
" laura has moderate learning difficulties bordering on severe and has a lot of trouble with the academic side , and emotionally .
" we are not against inclusion where appropriate but those who are in dean hall are there because they have failed in mainstream - all have been in mainstream , my daughter included . "
too big in her mainstream primary school , with 250 children , it became more and more apparent that they could not cope with her difficulties .
resources will be diverted to mainstream schools " she was in a class with children two and three years younger than herself and she was barely holding her own . "
the nearest secondary school has some 800 students .
" the sheer size would overwhelm her , " mrs dovey said .
" she is a very frightened , frustrated child and i know she would n't be able to cope . "
in practice , because of the proposed closure timetable , laura and others like her will not have to move during their schooling .
no fallback " so she will see her time out but that 's not the point - there will always be children like my daughter with the same anxieties .
" by closing the special schools they are taking away the choice that the parents and children have . "
research the council itself did on an earlier " integration initiative " to put youngsters into mainstream classes found that the vast majority of parents , schools and pupils were highly satisfied .
problems remained " personal and social dimensions were the most important positive benefits for pupils from being with their mainstream peers , particularly in the view of parents , although all parties were also pleased with the academic progress that the pupils were making . "
when concerns were expressed , the most common were about displays of aggression or frustration , and to an extent lack of academic progress .
" however , these problems ... did not necessarily disappear when the children transferred to special school , " said the report .
so the council 's plan is to switch the special needs funding from the area special schools to mainstream schools , increasing expertise and resources there .
no new youngsters would be taken on in the special schools and for a time , both systems would run in parallel .
' not about money ' that is why the council 's head of special education needs , steve huggett , says there is no suggestion its plans are about saving money .
in fact in the short term it will be spending more - nearly £ 2m extra next year - to run the two systems side by side .
it fails to show how its proposed changes will raise the standards of achievement of pupils with special educational needs ofsted report its development plan quotes a newcastle university review of research about children with moderate learning difficulties .
this concluded there was " no overwhelming evidence " that either type of schooling - special school or mainstream - was better .
in so far as there was a difference , mainstream provision had the edge in terms of children 's academic progress and general self-esteem .
because of extra transport and building costs , a special school placement did not allow as much money to be spent on the actual teaching and support as in an equivalent mainstream place .
" therefore mainstream placements were generally more cost effective , with resources directed to the child . "
small numbers gloucestershire adopts the principle that children should lead the most ordinary life possible .
there was no evidence that its proposals would put an unacceptable strain on mainstream schools , dr huggett said .
research did not show any correlation between inclusion and poorer standards of achievement .
" the other thing is the numbers : we are talking about 270 pupils extra , out of a school population of getting on for 85,000 . "
the vast majority of children with special needs - 16,000 or so - were already in mainstream schools .
fight goes on but campaigners such as gillian dovey and others she is in contact with - in , for example , dorset and wiltshire - are not placated .
" we saw such a big difference in our daughter in the first few months she was in dean hall , academically and emotionally , " she said .
" other parents had told us the same thing .
" we just thought , someone has got to fight for this .
" if we had n't stood up to the local education authority i think they would all have been closed by now .
" at least we have got the satisfaction of knowing that we have tried . "

kev gregory , usa in a few hours time i will be slipping out of the office here in kabul , along with colleagues from the humanitarian community , to watch at least the second half of the match - the only drawback is that we can only pick up the game on turkish satellite tv so the commentary may be a little tricky to follow !
but the flags will be waving , all the same .
eddie , afghanistan i 've got a few hours off from the un refugee agency to watch the match this afternoon .
will be wearing my " we lubb chu engrund " t-shirt .
simon russell , hong kong , china " i 'm running off early from work to the only pub serving real ale to watch the england win . "
chas cogan , australia as an ex pat in melbourne i will just be finishing my working day as the whistle blows.fortunately i 'm running off early from work to the only pub serving real ale to watch the england win .
chas cogan , australia i 'll be watching the game in a very small bar in a small town somewhere in southern ecuador ! !
andrew phillips , ecuador come on england ! - give us something to gloat about in front of the aussies - cheers !
paul - currently in sydney paul hartley , england i 'll be watching the biggest came since the ' 66 final in sydney .
the atmosphere here is great , england flags everywhere and even the sun has decided to come out to cheer the lads on !
come on ingerland and make this one , one to remember for a long time !
anthony , australia i will be in a hotel room in panama city , fl .
hoping that espn will be screening the match .
i have searched high and low for a bar that will be screening bit no luck .
otherwise i will be following the game of the world cup on beeb.com.
come on england ! !
mike , usa " looking forward to a fantastic game -lrb- i hope ! -rrb-
" jo , singapore the game will be played at 1430hrs singapore time .
i 've taken the day off .
looking forward to a fantastic game -lrb- i hope ! -rrb-
jo , singapore i 'm not a football fan but i am going to get some time off to watch the match with my husband at home .
many of my friends also have this plan and we are all supporting england .
only three hours to go and we can the exciting game kicked off .
maggie lo , hong kong -lrb- china -rrb- despite the game being aired at 3:30 a.m. here in brazil -lrb- brasilia time -rrb- , i 'll stay up tonight to watch brazil defeat england with a difference of at least two goals .
christiano jose jabur , brazil here i am in incheon , korea .
today , i will watch the biggest match in 2002 world cup at my medical clinic with ' be the reds ' shirt .
dear all the british and brazilian patients with ischemic heart disease : do n't excite ! just inspirate deeply and deeply ! ! and see you in final match ! !
taeyong son , korea in the united states , you would hardly know that there is a world cup competition in progress .
this despite the best showing an american team has made since the first tournament .
to most of us in the states , it 's about as exciting as watching grass grow .
mark , usa " school insisted that we learn physics rather than watch the game " duncan , uk the argentina game created a lot of arguments as our school insisted that we learn physics rather than watch the first 30 minutes of the game .
luckily this friday our assembly has been changed so the entire school will watch the match on a big screen .
people seem to be coming around to the idea of the world cup now that england is so high up in the competition .
duncan , uk i will be sitting in my bar , the fu pub on phuket island enjoying a cold beer watching england defeat brazil .
you 're all invited to join me .
kevin underdown , thailand my son has taken the whole month off !
he was the one in trafalagar square after the argentinian match on top of the statue with the cross of st george .
sarah gee , uk " i 'll rush out the lecture hall pretending i 've got diarrhoea " sohail khan , pakistan i am a medical student and i 'll be having a tutorial at the time the match starts .
i really do n't want to miss this exciting match so i 'll have to rush out the lecture hall pretending i 've got diarrhoea .
sohail khan , pakistan i certainly do n't intend being out on the streets tomorrow .
i dread to think what might happen if the english team loses .
there is a worrying potential for mob violence .
as it was , there was no shortage of drunken , loud-mouthed oafs around after last saturday 's match .
m m o , uk i 'll be watching the world cup , with a flag in one hand , a pint of good ole british cold beer , and not a single negative thought in my mind .
godspeed lads !
go get ' em ! ! !
colin , en-gaaa-laaand my company sent a survey round to staff offering us time off if we take holiday entitlement or make up hours , or have tv or radios in office , which we have , so no-one has taken a sickie .
sensible company , and it has worked .
barbara osborn , england when england plays , it 's a perfect time to get out and get everything done - or so i thought !
i was in a shopping centre recently during a game , and one of the malls in front of an electrical goods store became a viewing gallery .
you could hear the chants throughout the shopping centre .
it seems those like me who have no interest in football just ca n't get away from it wherever we go !
p g , uk " give employees a couple of hours off to watch the matches " colin g , uk all the latest business hype is about teams and team building .
here we have a period where most of the country , football enthusiasts or not -lrb- i am not -rrb- are united in their support of the england team .
companies should recognise and capitalise on this by joining their employees in this demonstration of support .
provide a few tvs and give employees a couple of hours off to watch the matches and this gesture of goodwill will be remembered .
colin g , uk i am currently doing my final teaching practice to become fully trained teacher , and can not skip a days work to watch the football .
-lrb- this goes for the majority of other teachers -rrb- .
luckily the argentina game was during half term , but last week 's match and the following 1 -lrb- hopefully 2 -rrb- are on when i am teaching at school .
this means unless the head decides to let us watch it , which did n't happen before , then we do n't get to see the end of the game .
plus we have lots of disappointed children as well .
catherine , uk the time conversion has been a disaster .
i 've only seen two games thus far , given i live in california , most of the live games are on too late , usually 2:30am or 4:30am most often during work days , including the usa / mexico game monday early in the am .
since ' 94 was in the usa , ' 98 in france , and 2002 in east asia , i guess it 's appropriate that someone in the western hemisphere gets to host it again in 2006 !
stephen , usa " there is hardly any tv coverage of the largest participation sport in the uk : fishing . "
mark cordell , teesside i always find it strange that there is hardly any tv coverage of the largest participation sport in the uk : fishing .
contrary to all the hype , i think most people have little to no interest in football / soccer or whatever it 's called .
mark cordell , teesside , england missing work , missing school , it 'll only be a day or two .. but to miss england score those masterful goals is like a dagger through my heart !
so cheer on the lads because england winning is an incredible feeling !
jimi , canada what a way to go - the danes were struck by the tornado .
england can repeat 1966 if they are persistent .
khalid rahim , canada " enjoy the footy " s. smith , uk why is there so much fuss about the cost to the economy of people watching england in the world cup ?
how on earth can some accountant put a figure on it and who cares anyway ?
there 's obviously going to be people taking a little time out to watch games , but in most cases it makes it makes absolutely no difference to the work they do - it may even make them more productive .
workers are not robots digging holes , so economists please shut up for the next two weeks and enjoy the footie .
s. smith , uk please , for the next world cup , can all the matches be on the bbc ?
your coverage of the tournament has been excellent while itv have been absolutely abysmal .
the bbc understand that this is the ' world ' cup and does not cut off an incredibly exciting game between two other countries -lrb- paraguay v south africa in itv 's case -rrb- to show yet more interviews with michael owen -lrb- as if we have n't had a whole 6 months of them -rrb- .
keep up the good work .
james warwick , uk i wo n't be taking any notice , as i loathe the oafish game .
bob harvey , lincs , uk in 1989 i bought a 6 inch black and white tv with its own internal 4 hour battery pack .
i place it on my desk and watch all the games televised .
this is now the fourth word cup i have used it and non of my bosses have ever objected .
graham , uk " we will still be watching england even if we all have to pull sickies and get the sack " ian richardson , england my boss is a miserable so and so and has effectively banned anybody from watching any football - even during our lunch hour .
we will still be watching england though - even if we all have to pull sickies and get the sack .
it 's worth it !
ian richardson , england i work for a large software company .
they are streaming the games live to our desktops , sound and all !
now that is good for relations with management !
chris snell , uk luckily for us the games are on at reasonable times ; 4pm , 7.30 and 9.30pm.
last friday we were at an english pub after work -lrb- with queues going out the door and round the corner from 6pm -rrb- to watch england beat argentina .
the atmosphere was brilliant , if a little squashed but a great night was had by all .
tomorrow night will probably be a repeat performance .
janelle , melbourne , australia i am not a football follower and have no particular interest in the world cup , so staying off work to watch matches seems strange to me .
however , it does occur to me that uk businesses may now be reaping what they have sown over the past decade or so .
they have done little to maintain employee loyalty with issues such as laying off people only to rehire them on short term contracts in order to avoid long employment period liabilities and , more recently , issues such as summary changes being made to pension scheme arrangements .
of course there are many excellent employers out there and i do n't agree with skiving off , but who 's to blame for the general change in employee loyalty ?
paul b , oxfordshire , uk " business and getting to work is not always a priority " roy harvey , uk business and getting to work is not always a priority .
when is the world of business going to face up to the fact that we have much better things to be doing with our time ?
when it suits a company , they make us redundant - is it any wonder that we do n't care if we lose a couple of hours here and there .
roy harvey , uk i am a dissident when it comes to big sporting events .
i will not pay attention .
michael karcher , usa as soon as i got to work , i rushed to my computer to check your website for the england-nigeria score and highlights .
i was lucky enough to be able to watch the games which began at 5am local time , as they ended by the time i had to leave to catch the train for work .
my mother has been taping the 7.30am matches , so i can watch them in the evening .
but i 'm glad england got through to the second round , and i 'll be able to watch the next match over the weekend .
barbara canary , boston , usa i have the bbc sport web score ticker for most games but the irish and english games are on the big screen in the board room .
the company i work for rocks !
maxine , n ireland i 'm down here working with the germans and french on the next ariane launch , which means supporting ireland , england and germany .
since the french are a little bit left out we 've suggested they support their b team ie - senegal ! !
ian henry , french guyana " it will be pretty hard for any team to overcome senegal . "
pascal nzabonimpa , usa after watching senegal play in the african cup against cameroon -lrb- the team that i support -rrb- and seeing them play in this world cup i think there is nothing stopping this team .
after beating ' les bleus ' it will be pretty hard for any team to overcome senegal .
i believe that it would even have survived if it was in the ' group of death ' .
pascal nzabonimpa , usa for the england vs. argentina game i watched the first half in leeds city centre on a giant screen and listened to the second half on a small radio back at work since my boss was away that day .
the england v nigeria match i watched from 7.30 to 8.00 at home , from 8.00 to 8.15 on my radio whilst waiting for the bus .
for the second half i walked through town with my small radio glued to my ear and ended up watching the last 20 minutes in the pub just a stone 's throw away from my work .
i got into work for 9.30 .
i have made up the time by working through my lunch .
cathy harrison , england i go into the royal marsden hospital , sutton this morning for 3 days of chemotherapy and will watch the saturday match from my room in the robert tiffany ward .
thank you for a consistently enjoyable and informative programme .
peter thurston , uk " we could n't drag ourselves out of bed " greg , wales well i was n't going to miss it , and the intention was to get down our bar in university halls , but things do n't always work out that way for us at 07:00 !
we could n't drag ourselves out of bed , and we do n't really regret it .
greg , wales some businessman has snagged the exclusive tv rights for the uae so you can only watch the world cup by buying an expensive new satellite system .
luckily , i live near the omani border and can pick up the picture where they are showing all the matches free !
paul hudson , ras al khaimah , united arab emirates despite getting up at 05:30 for the match i missed it as i stood on various platforms waiting for trains and tubes .
still , the silverlink train drivers will have enjoyed seeing it at home .
humph .
anon , uk " all the adrenalin has been zapped out of my system " geoff bell , england for the first time in almost 12 years i watched an england game sober and then went to work .
i now feel worse for not having a drink as all the adrenalin has been zapped out of my system thanks to the monotony of jimmy young in the afternoon - roll on 16:30 and a pint or two to celebrate !
geoff bell , england seems like half of blighty is out here on koh samui .
game kicked off at 13:30 , it 's now 19:30 and everyone is wasted thanks to the free shots being handed out by swedes in the viking bar .
must go , need sleep .
dan , thailand i 'm living in the middle of nowhere in north sumatra so i 'll be supporting ireland and england to the background chorus of the jungle .
the local people here are bataks ; the uk would be surprised to know how many batak supporters they have ! !
james lewis , wales " bunking off to watch the footie should be a doddle " alex duggan , uk i do n't do much at work anyway - i usually try to spend my day surfing the web - so bunking off to watch the footie should be a doddle .
i 'll just leave my office door open , make sure i have papers under my arm as a cover if i meet anyone , and sneak out , pretending i have a meeting somewhere .
alex duggan , uk we 're not allowed to watch the england matches at work and the firm i work for have invited a load of business people to our function room to watch the match .
staff were sat at their desks whilst half-cut business people wandered round the office in the breaks .
needless to say morale is incredibly low .
anon , england who cares what the pinstriped fat cats say ?
the thought of these apoplectic fools frothing at the mouth at workers skiving off makes me laugh out loud .
if employers are n't enlightened enough to let you watch the world cup then by all means phone in sick .
after all they ca n't sack the entire workforce .
nick , uk i live in vienna but had to work , so i watched -lrb- read -rrb- the game via the bbc 's website - well done the beeb .
mike , austria " i 'd rather be sacked than miss out " erik ridehalgh , england i wo n't be going to work when the games are on .
i 'd rather be sacked than miss out on a chance to roar england to victory .
erik ridehalgh , england i do n't intend watching any more england games unless i have trouble sleeping .
i have a video of the nigeria game , should the insomnia get really bad .
leigh , usa -lrb- uk originally -rrb- how will i be watching ?
on the edge of my seat , hoping rio ferdinand stays in the zone !
ben drake , york , uk " we resorted to a live commentary on a phone line from wales ! "
keeley and kirsten , france we 're in paris and they were showing the argentina vs sweden match so we resorted to a live commentary on a phone line from wales !
thanks tom .
keeley and kirsten , france my company hired a room and big screen at the reebok stadium and provided breakfast and a free bar ! !
far from reducing productivity i am motivated to do more .
jon sockett , england booked a half-day holiday , got up , watched the first half , cooked a fry up at half-time , watched the second half , went back to bed for an hour , get up , went to work .
simple !
steve hodgson , uk i 'll go to the supermarket as it 's practically empty when the football is on !
jacky , england i watched the match at my local gym whilst working out .
sunjay bhogal , london , uk " productivity will probably improve " steve cahill , england my employers have taken the most generous , sensible and mature decision to provide big screen tvs for all the england / ireland games .
so what if people watch the games ?
there are no sickies being taken and people are available on-site if any work problems arise .
more importantly , it has served to cultivate good employer / ee relations .
in the long term , productivity will probably improve as a result of this policy .
steve cahill , england i wo n't be watching it at all .
i could not care less who wins !
e. severn , uk it is n't too bad here - all i have to do is book one of the conference rooms to watch england .
and when germany play , i get to catch up on my work and hear the colleagues scream for the germans .
mark hendrikx , berlin , germany " straight down the local for a couple of beers " gaz of pompey , england finish a 12 hour nightshift at 07:00 then straight down the local for a couple of beers and a bacon roll or 3 ... lovely !
come on eng-ger-land ! !
gaz of pompey , england i 'll be in an irish pub in downtown chicago with about 250 other ex-pats cheering on england live on espn .
jack liebeskind , usa / uk ex-pat here in mexico the games are on right in the middle of the night so what we do is sleep after work from around 18:00 until 01:00 and then stay up throughout the night watching the games !
it 's tiring but worth every second of it !
mark van der ploeg , mexico / ex-uk and holland i had to fly out to the us yesterday - talk about bad timing .
i 'll be setting the alarm in my hotel room to wake me up at 02:30 so that i can watch the game live ...
come on lads - we know you can do it ! ! !
jonathan , usa -lrb- temporarily -rrb- well i 'm in the british army , currently stationed in the us .
it 's on air at 02:35 and i 'll be up with my 10-year-old son cheering every step of the way ! !
rob urquhart , usa " i can always watch it again in the evening " rhys jaggar , england first half on the telly at home , second half on the radio .
i 've deliberately arranged a client meeting in north manchester for 09:30 , so as to ease the traffic problems for the journey .
any other day it would take an hour , wednesday : well , i reckon 25 minutes should get me there .
i can always watch it again in the evening ...
rhys jaggar , england we 'll be up at 02:25 to watch : so they 'd better not disappoint .
steve robertson , usa east coast / ex uk i 'll be setting up an honorary nigeria football supporters ' club -lrb- just for tonight that is ! -rrb-
i am welsh , in california , but will not be supporting england any of the way !
robin jones , wales well here in canada it is a big event , almost eclipsing the stanley cup .
it 's on at 23:00 so i have to go home and nap so i can stay up .
here we go ! !
andrew smith , vancouver , canada my company has put up three large plasma screens -lrb- costing six grand to hire -rrb- for us to watch whatever matches we like -lrb- and wimbledon too -rrb- .
i reckon a fifth of the company watched the argentina match .
so whilst this represents a lot in lost earnings , it does create a hell of a lot more respect for management and thus in the long term costs will doubtless be recouped .
jon , uk i swapped my shift to a ' late ' so i can stay in bed for the match and be at work for 11:00 .
if they play like they did against sweden i 'll probably fall back to sleep , but if they play like they did against argentina i 'm worried my bed springs wo n't be able to take me jumping up and down for 90 minutes .
billy , uk " this is one of the better timed games " tony hughes , usa this is one of the better timed games .
it 's on at 11:00 here in california , and it 's on live so me and the family will be glued to the set praying that england do n't mess things up .
nigeria will not be easy but there is something different about the england team this time around , come on england ! ! ! ! ! ! !
tony hughes , usa i 'll be watching the match down here in chile , five-hour time difference with the uk !
i 'm welsh , but i 'll be supporting england all the way .
lesley pulsford , chile , south america ha .
i 'll be watching re-runs on espn over here .
biggest sporting event in the world and the americans barely notice .
oh well , at least a couple of the england games are live .

in leeds ' millennium square , 7,000 fans are expected to watch the match on a huge screen at britain 's largest world cup gathering .
the 32-metre screen erected in london 's trafalgar square is expected to attract so many fans that authorities are asking people who do n't work in the area to stay away for safety reasons .
mg rover staff in birmingham have been granted the day off and even churches are bowing to the popularity of the game - leigh road baptist church in leigh-on-sea is providing its worshippers with a screening of the most fearsome game for english fans .
at manchester 's pure space café , the hospitality even extends to brazilian supporters who have admitted some nervousness about the game .
are you going to phone in sick ?

m m o , uk i 'll be watching the world cup , with a flag in one hand , a pint of good ole british cold beer , and not a single negative thought in my mind .
godspeed lads !
go get ' em ! ! !
colin , en-gaaa-laaand my company sent a survey round to staff offering us time off if we take holiday entitlement or make up hours , or have tv or radios in office , which we have , so no-one has taken a sickie .
sensible company , and it has worked .
barbara osborn , england when england plays , it 's a perfect time to get out and get everything done - or so i thought !
i was in a shopping centre recently during a game , and one of the malls in front of an electrical goods store became a viewing gallery .
you could hear the chants throughout the shopping centre .
it seems those like me who have no interest in football just ca n't get away from it wherever we go !
p g , uk give employees a couple of hours off to watch the matches colin g , uk all the latest business hype is about teams and team building .
here we have a period where most of the country , football enthusiasts or not -lrb- i am not -rrb- are united in their support of the england team .
companies should recognise and capitalise on this by joining their employees in this demonstration of support .
provide a few tvs and give employees a couple of hours off to watch the matches and this gesture of goodwill will be remembered .
colin g , uk i am currently doing my final teaching practice to become fully trained teacher , and can not skip a days work to watch the football .
-lrb- this goes for the majority of other teachers -rrb- .
luckily the argentina game was during half term , but last week 's match and the following 1 -lrb- hopefully 2 -rrb- are on when i am teaching at school .
this means unless the head decides to let us watch it , which did n't happen before , then we do n't get to see the end of the game .
plus we have lots of disappointed children as well .
catherine , uk the time conversion has been a disaster .
i 've only seen two games thus far , given i live in california , most of the live games are on too late , usually 2:30am or 4:30am most often during work days , including the usa / mexico game monday early in the am .
since ' 94 was in the usa , ' 98 in france , and 2002 in east asia , i guess it 's appropriate that someone in the western hemisphere gets to host it again in 2006 !
stephen , usa there is hardly any tv coverage of the largest participation sport in the uk : fishing .
mark cordell , teesside i always find it strange that there is hardly any tv coverage of the largest participation sport in the uk : fishing .
contrary to all the hype , i think most people have little to no interest in football / soccer or whatever it 's called .
mark cordell , teesside , england missing work , missing school , it 'll only be a day or two .. but to miss england score those masterful goals is like a dagger through my heart !
so cheer on the lads because england winning is an incredible feeling !
jimi , canada what a way to go - the danes were struck by the tornado .
england can repeat 1966 if they are persistent .
khalid rahim , canada enjoy the footy s. smith , uk why is there so much fuss about the cost to the economy of people watching england in the world cup ?
how on earth can some accountant put a figure on it and who cares anyway ?
there 's obviously going to be people taking a little time out to watch games , but in most cases it makes it makes absolutely no difference to the work they do - it may even make them more productive .
workers are not robots digging holes , so economists please shut up for the next two weeks and enjoy the footie .
s. smith , uk please , for the next world cup , can all the matches be on the bbc ?
your coverage of the tournament has been excellent while itv have been absolutely abysmal .
the bbc understand that this is the ' world ' cup and does not cut off an incredibly exciting game between two other countries -lrb- paraguay v south africa in itv 's case -rrb- to show yet more interviews with michael owen -lrb- as if we have n't had a whole 6 months of them -rrb- .
keep up the good work .
james warwick , uk i wo n't be taking any notice , as i loathe the oafish game .
bob harvey , lincs , uk in 1989 i bought a 6 inch black and white tv with its own internal 4 hour battery pack .
i place it on my desk and watch all the games televised .
this is now the fourth word cup i have used it and non of my bosses have ever objected .
graham , uk we will still be watching england even if we all have to pull sickies and get the sack ian richardson , england my boss is a miserable so and so and has effectively banned anybody from watching any football - even during our lunch hour .
we will still be watching england though - even if we all have to pull sickies and get the sack .
it 's worth it !
ian richardson , england i work for a large software company .
they are streaming the games live to our desktops , sound and all !
now that is good for relations with management !
chris snell , uk luckily for us the games are on at reasonable times ; 4pm , 7.30 and 9.30pm.
last friday we were at an english pub after work -lrb- with queues going out the door and round the corner from 6pm -rrb- to watch england beat argentina .
the atmosphere was brilliant , if a little squashed but a great night was had by all .
tomorrow night will probably be a repeat performance .
janelle , melbourne , australia i am not a football follower and have no particular interest in the world cup , so staying off work to watch matches seems strange to me .
however , it does occur to me that uk businesses may now be reaping what they have sown over the past decade or so .
they have done little to maintain employee loyalty with issues such as laying off people only to rehire them on short term contracts in order to avoid long employment period liabilities and , more recently , issues such as summary changes being made to pension scheme arrangements .
of course there are many excellent employers out there and i do n't agree with skiving off , but who 's to blame for the general change in employee loyalty ?
paul b , oxfordshire , uk business and getting to work is not always a priority roy harvey , uk business and getting to work is not always a priority .
when is the world of business going to face up to the fact that we have much better things to be doing with our time ?
when it suits a company , they make us redundant - is it any wonder that we do n't care if we lose a couple of hours here and there .
roy harvey , uk i am a dissident when it comes to big sporting events .
i will not pay attention .
michael karcher , usa as soon as i got to work , i rushed to my computer to check your website for the england-nigeria score and highlights .
i was lucky enough to be able to watch the games which began at 5am local time , as they ended by the time i had to leave to catch the train for work .
my mother has been taping the 7.30am matches , so i can watch them in the evening .
but i 'm glad england got through to the second round , and i 'll be able to watch the next match over the weekend .
barbara canary , boston , usa i have the bbc sport web score ticker for most games but the irish and english games are on the big screen in the board room .
the company i work for rocks !
maxine , n ireland i 'm down here working with the germans and french on the next ariane launch , which means supporting ireland , england and germany .
since the french are a little bit left out we 've suggested they support their b team ie - senegal ! !
ian henry , french guyana it will be pretty hard for any team to overcome senegal .
pascal nzabonimpa , usa after watching senegal play in the african cup against cameroon -lrb- the team that i support -rrb- and seeing them play in this world cup i think there is nothing stopping this team .
after beating ' les bleus ' it will be pretty hard for any team to overcome senegal .
i believe that it would even have survived if it was in the ' group of death ' .
pascal nzabonimpa , usa for the england vs. argentina game i watched the first half in leeds city centre on a giant screen and listened to the second half on a small radio back at work since my boss was away that day .
the england v nigeria match i watched from 7.30 to 8.00 at home , from 8.00 to 8.15 on my radio whilst waiting for the bus .
for the second half i walked through town with my small radio glued to my ear and ended up watching the last 20 minutes in the pub just a stone 's throw away from my work .
i got into work for 9.30 .
i have made up the time by working through my lunch .
cathy harrison , england i go into the royal marsden hospital , sutton this morning for 3 days of chemotherapy and will watch the saturday match from my room in the robert tiffany ward .
thank you for a consistently enjoyable and informative programme .
peter thurston , uk we could n't drag ourselves out of bed greg , wales well i was n't going to miss it , and the intention was to get down our bar in university halls , but things do n't always work out that way for us at 07:00 !
we could n't drag ourselves out of bed , and we do n't really regret it .
greg , wales some businessman has snagged the exclusive tv rights for the uae so you can only watch the world cup by buying an expensive new satellite system .
luckily , i live near the omani border and can pick up the picture where they are showing all the matches free !
paul hudson , ras al khaimah , united arab emirates despite getting up at 05:30 for the match i missed it as i stood on various platforms waiting for trains and tubes .
still , the silverlink train drivers will have enjoyed seeing it at home .
humph .
anon , uk all the adrenalin has been zapped out of my system geoff bell , england for the first time in almost 12 years i watched an england game sober and then went to work .
i now feel worse for not having a drink as all the adrenalin has been zapped out of my system thanks to the monotony of jimmy young in the afternoon - roll on 16:30 and a pint or two to celebrate !
geoff bell , england seems like half of blighty is out here on koh samui .
game kicked off at 13:30 , it 's now 19:30 and everyone is wasted thanks to the free shots being handed out by swedes in the viking bar .
must go , need sleep .
dan , thailand i 'm living in the middle of nowhere in north sumatra so i 'll be supporting ireland and england to the background chorus of the jungle .
the local people here are bataks ; the uk would be surprised to know how many batak supporters they have ! !
james lewis , wales bunking off to watch the footie should be a doddle alex duggan , uk i do n't do much at work anyway - i usually try to spend my day surfing the web - so bunking off to watch the footie should be a doddle .
i 'll just leave my office door open , make sure i have papers under my arm as a cover if i meet anyone , and sneak out , pretending i have a meeting somewhere .
alex duggan , uk we 're not allowed to watch the england matches at work and the firm i work for have invited a load of business people to our function room to watch the match .
staff were sat at their desks whilst half-cut business people wandered round the office in the breaks .
needless to say morale is incredibly low .
anon , england who cares what the pinstriped fat cats say ?
the thought of these apoplectic fools frothing at the mouth at workers skiving off makes me laugh out loud .
if employers are n't enlightened enough to let you watch the world cup then by all means phone in sick .
after all they ca n't sack the entire workforce .
nick , uk i live in vienna but had to work , so i watched -lrb- read -rrb- the game via the bbc 's website - well done the beeb .
mike , austria i 'd rather be sacked than miss out erik ridehalgh , england i wo n't be going to work when the games are on .
i 'd rather be sacked than miss out on a chance to roar england to victory .
erik ridehalgh , england i do n't intend watching any more england games unless i have trouble sleeping .
i have a video of the nigeria game , should the insomnia get really bad .
leigh , usa -lrb- uk originally -rrb- how will i be watching ?
on the edge of my seat , hoping rio ferdinand stays in the zone !
ben drake , york , uk we resorted to a live commentary on a phone line from wales !
keeley and kirsten , france we 're in paris and they were showing the argentina vs sweden match so we resorted to a live commentary on a phone line from wales !
thanks tom .
keeley and kirsten , france my company hired a room and big screen at the reebok stadium and provided breakfast and a free bar ! !
far from reducing productivity i am motivated to do more .
jon sockett , england booked a half-day holiday , got up , watched the first half , cooked a fry up at half-time , watched the second half , went back to bed for an hour , get up , went to work .
simple !
steve hodgson , uk i 'll go to the supermarket as it 's practically empty when the football is on !
jacky , england i watched the match at my local gym whilst working out .
sunjay bhogal , london , uk productivity will probably improve steve cahill , england my employers have taken the most generous , sensible and mature decision to provide big screen tvs for all the england / ireland games .
so what if people watch the games ?
there are no sickies being taken and people are available on-site if any work problems arise .
more importantly , it has served to cultivate good employer / ee relations .
in the long term , productivity will probably improve as a result of this policy .
steve cahill , england i wo n't be watching it at all .
i could not care less who wins !
e. severn , uk it is n't too bad here - all i have to do is book one of the conference rooms to watch england .
and when germany play , i get to catch up on my work and hear the colleagues scream for the germans .
mark hendrikx , berlin , germany straight down the local for a couple of beers gaz of pompey , england finish a 12 hour nightshift at 07:00 then straight down the local for a couple of beers and a bacon roll or 3 ... lovely !
come on eng-ger-land ! !
gaz of pompey , england i 'll be in an irish pub in downtown chicago with about 250 other ex-pats cheering on england live on espn .
jack liebeskind , usa / uk ex-pat here in mexico the games are on right in the middle of the night so what we do is sleep after work from around 18:00 until 01:00 and then stay up throughout the night watching the games !
it 's tiring but worth every second of it !
mark van der ploeg , mexico / ex-uk and holland i had to fly out to the us yesterday - talk about bad timing .
i 'll be setting the alarm in my hotel room to wake me up at 02:30 so that i can watch the game live ...
come on lads - we know you can do it ! ! !
jonathan , usa -lrb- temporarily -rrb- well i 'm in the british army , currently stationed in the us .
it 's on air at 02:35 and i 'll be up with my 10-year-old son cheering every step of the way ! !
rob urquhart , usa i can always watch it again in the evening rhys jaggar , england first half on the telly at home , second half on the radio .
i 've deliberately arranged a client meeting in north manchester for 09:30 , so as to ease the traffic problems for the journey .
any other day it would take an hour , wednesday : well , i reckon 25 minutes should get me there .
i can always watch it again in the evening ...
rhys jaggar , england we 'll be up at 02:25 to watch : so they 'd better not disappoint .
steve robertson , usa east coast / ex uk i 'll be setting up an honorary nigeria football supporters ' club -lrb- just for tonight that is ! -rrb-
i am welsh , in california , but will not be supporting england any of the way !
robin jones , wales well here in canada it is a big event , almost eclipsing the stanley cup .
it 's on at 23:00 so i have to go home and nap so i can stay up .
here we go ! !
andrew smith , vancouver , canada my company has put up three large plasma screens -lrb- costing six grand to hire -rrb- for us to watch whatever matches we like -lrb- and wimbledon too -rrb- .
i reckon a fifth of the company watched the argentina match .
so whilst this represents a lot in lost earnings , it does create a hell of a lot more respect for management and thus in the long term costs will doubtless be recouped .
jon , uk i swapped my shift to a ' late ' so i can stay in bed for the match and be at work for 11:00 .
if they play like they did against sweden i 'll probably fall back to sleep , but if they play like they did against argentina i 'm worried my bed springs wo n't be able to take me jumping up and down for 90 minutes .
billy , uk this is one of the better timed games tony hughes , usa this is one of the better timed games .
it 's on at 11:00 here in california , and it 's on live so me and the family will be glued to the set praying that england do n't mess things up .
nigeria will not be easy but there is something different about the england team this time around , come on england ! ! ! ! ! ! !
tony hughes , usa i 'll be watching the match down here in chile , five-hour time difference with the uk !
i 'm welsh , but i 'll be supporting england all the way .
lesley pulsford , chile , south america ha .
i 'll be watching re-runs on espn over here .
biggest sporting event in the world and the americans barely notice .
oh well , at least a couple of the england games are live .

kev gregory , usa in a few hours time i will be slipping out of the office here in kabul , along with colleagues from the humanitarian community , to watch at least the second half of the match - the only drawback is that we can only pick up the game on turkish satellite tv so the commentary may be a little tricky to follow !

this despite the best showing an american team has made since the first tournament .
to most of us in the states , it 's about as exciting as watching grass grow .
mark , usa school insisted that we learn physics rather than watch the game duncan , uk the argentina game created a lot of arguments as our school insisted that we learn physics rather than watch the first 30 minutes of the game .
luckily this friday our assembly has been changed so the entire school will watch the match on a big screen .
people seem to be coming around to the idea of the world cup now that england is so high up in the competition .
duncan , uk i will be sitting in my bar , the fu pub on phuket island enjoying a cold beer watching england defeat brazil .

sohail khan , pakistan i certainly do n't intend being out on the streets tomorrow .
i dread to think what might happen if the english team loses .
there is a worrying potential for mob violence .
as it was , there was no shortage of drunken , loud-mouthed oafs around after last saturday 's match .
m m o , uk i 'll be watching the world cup , with a flag in one hand , a pint of good ole british cold beer , and not a single negative thought in my mind .

janelle , melbourne , australia i am not a football follower and have no particular interest in the world cup , so staying off work to watch matches seems strange to me .
however , it does occur to me that uk businesses may now be reaping what they have sown over the past decade or so .
they have done little to maintain employee loyalty with issues such as laying off people only to rehire them on short term contracts in order to avoid long employment period liabilities and , more recently , issues such as summary changes being made to pension scheme arrangements .
of course there are many excellent employers out there and i do n't agree with skiving off , but who 's to blame for the general change in employee loyalty ?
paul b , oxfordshire , uk business and getting to work is not always a priority roy harvey , uk business and getting to work is not always a priority .
when is the world of business going to face up to the fact that we have much better things to be doing with our time ?
when it suits a company , they make us redundant - is it any wonder that we do n't care if we lose a couple of hours here and there .
roy harvey , uk i am a dissident when it comes to big sporting events .
i will not pay attention .
michael karcher , usa as soon as i got to work , i rushed to my computer to check your website for the england-nigeria score and highlights .
i was lucky enough to be able to watch the games which began at 5am local time , as they ended by the time i had to leave to catch the train for work .
my mother has been taping the 7.30am matches , so i can watch them in the evening .
but i 'm glad england got through to the second round , and i 'll be able to watch the next match over the weekend .
barbara canary , boston , usa i have the bbc sport web score ticker for most games but the irish and english games are on the big screen in the board room .
the company i work for rocks !
maxine , n ireland i 'm down here working with the germans and french on the next ariane launch , which means supporting ireland , england and germany .
since the french are a little bit left out we 've suggested they support their b team ie - senegal ! !
ian henry , french guyana it will be pretty hard for any team to overcome senegal .
pascal nzabonimpa , usa after watching senegal play in the african cup against cameroon -lrb- the team that i support -rrb- and seeing them play in this world cup i think there is nothing stopping this team .
after beating ' les bleus ' it will be pretty hard for any team to overcome senegal .
i believe that it would even have survived if it was in the ' group of death ' .
pascal nzabonimpa , usa for the england vs. argentina game i watched the first half in leeds city centre on a giant screen and listened to the second half on a small radio back at work since my boss was away that day .
the england v nigeria match i watched from 7.30 to 8.00 at home , from 8.00 to 8.15 on my radio whilst waiting for the bus .
for the second half i walked through town with my small radio glued to my ear and ended up watching the last 20 minutes in the pub just a stone 's throw away from my work .
i got into work for 9.30 .
i have made up the time by working through my lunch .
cathy harrison , england i go into the royal marsden hospital , sutton this morning for 3 days of chemotherapy and will watch the saturday match from my room in the robert tiffany ward .
thank you for a consistently enjoyable and informative programme .
peter thurston , uk we could n't drag ourselves out of bed greg , wales well i was n't going to miss it , and the intention was to get down our bar in university halls , but things do n't always work out that way for us at 07:00 !
we could n't drag ourselves out of bed , and we do n't really regret it .
greg , wales some businessman has snagged the exclusive tv rights for the uae so you can only watch the world cup by buying an expensive new satellite system .
luckily , i live near the omani border and can pick up the picture where they are showing all the matches free !
paul hudson , ras al khaimah , united arab emirates despite getting up at 05:30 for the match i missed it as i stood on various platforms waiting for trains and tubes .
still , the silverlink train drivers will have enjoyed seeing it at home .
humph .
anon , uk all the adrenalin has been zapped out of my system geoff bell , england for the first time in almost 12 years i watched an england game sober and then went to work .
i now feel worse for not having a drink as all the adrenalin has been zapped out of my system thanks to the monotony of jimmy young in the afternoon - roll on 16:30 and a pint or two to celebrate !
geoff bell , england seems like half of blighty is out here on koh samui .
game kicked off at 13:30 , it 's now 19:30 and everyone is wasted thanks to the free shots being handed out by swedes in the viking bar .
must go , need sleep .
dan , thailand i 'm living in the middle of nowhere in north sumatra so i 'll be supporting ireland and england to the background chorus of the jungle .
the local people here are bataks ; the uk would be surprised to know how many batak supporters they have ! !
james lewis , wales bunking off to watch the footie should be a doddle alex duggan , uk i do n't do much at work anyway - i usually try to spend my day surfing the web - so bunking off to watch the footie should be a doddle .
i 'll just leave my office door open , make sure i have papers under my arm as a cover if i meet anyone , and sneak out , pretending i have a meeting somewhere .
alex duggan , uk we 're not allowed to watch the england matches at work and the firm i work for have invited a load of business people to our function room to watch the match .
staff were sat at their desks whilst half-cut business people wandered round the office in the breaks .
needless to say morale is incredibly low .
anon , england who cares what the pinstriped fat cats say ?
the thought of these apoplectic fools frothing at the mouth at workers skiving off makes me laugh out loud .
if employers are n't enlightened enough to let you watch the world cup then by all means phone in sick .
after all they ca n't sack the entire workforce .
nick , uk i live in vienna but had to work , so i watched -lrb- read -rrb- the game via the bbc 's website - well done the beeb .
mike , austria i 'd rather be sacked than miss out erik ridehalgh , england i wo n't be going to work when the games are on .
i 'd rather be sacked than miss out on a chance to roar england to victory .
erik ridehalgh , england i do n't intend watching any more england games unless i have trouble sleeping .
i have a video of the nigeria game , should the insomnia get really bad .
leigh , usa -lrb- uk originally -rrb- how will i be watching ?
on the edge of my seat , hoping rio ferdinand stays in the zone !
ben drake , york , uk we resorted to a live commentary on a phone line from wales !
keeley and kirsten , france we 're in paris and they were showing the argentina vs sweden match so we resorted to a live commentary on a phone line from wales !
thanks tom .
keeley and kirsten , france my company hired a room and big screen at the reebok stadium and provided breakfast and a free bar ! !
far from reducing productivity i am motivated to do more .
jon sockett , england booked a half-day holiday , got up , watched the first half , cooked a fry up at half-time , watched the second half , went back to bed for an hour , get up , went to work .
simple !
steve hodgson , uk i 'll go to the supermarket as it 's practically empty when the football is on !
jacky , england i watched the match at my local gym whilst working out .
sunjay bhogal , london , uk productivity will probably improve steve cahill , england my employers have taken the most generous , sensible and mature decision to provide big screen tvs for all the england / ireland games .
so what if people watch the games ?
there are no sickies being taken and people are available on-site if any work problems arise .
more importantly , it has served to cultivate good employer / ee relations .
in the long term , productivity will probably improve as a result of this policy .
steve cahill , england i wo n't be watching it at all .
i could not care less who wins !
e. severn , uk it is n't too bad here - all i have to do is book one of the conference rooms to watch england .
and when germany play , i get to catch up on my work and hear the colleagues scream for the germans .
mark hendrikx , berlin , germany straight down the local for a couple of beers gaz of pompey , england finish a 12 hour nightshift at 07:00 then straight down the local for a couple of beers and a bacon roll or 3 ... lovely !
come on eng-ger-land ! !
gaz of pompey , england i 'll be in an irish pub in downtown chicago with about 250 other ex-pats cheering on england live on espn .
jack liebeskind , usa / uk ex-pat here in mexico the games are on right in the middle of the night so what we do is sleep after work from around 18:00 until 01:00 and then stay up throughout the night watching the games !
it 's tiring but worth every second of it !
mark van der ploeg , mexico / ex-uk and holland i had to fly out to the us yesterday - talk about bad timing .
i 'll be setting the alarm in my hotel room to wake me up at 02:30 so that i can watch the game live ...
come on lads - we know you can do it ! ! !
jonathan , usa -lrb- temporarily -rrb- well i 'm in the british army , currently stationed in the us .
it 's on air at 02:35 and i 'll be up with my 10-year-old son cheering every step of the way ! !
rob urquhart , usa i can always watch it again in the evening rhys jaggar , england first half on the telly at home , second half on the radio .
i 've deliberately arranged a client meeting in north manchester for 09:30 , so as to ease the traffic problems for the journey .
any other day it would take an hour , wednesday : well , i reckon 25 minutes should get me there .
i can always watch it again in the evening ...
rhys jaggar , england we 'll be up at 02:25 to watch : so they 'd better not disappoint .
steve robertson , usa east coast / ex uk i 'll be setting up an honorary nigeria football supporters ' club -lrb- just for tonight that is ! -rrb-
i am welsh , in california , but will not be supporting england any of the way !
robin jones , wales well here in canada it is a big event , almost eclipsing the stanley cup .
it 's on at 23:00 so i have to go home and nap so i can stay up .
here we go ! !
andrew smith , vancouver , canada my company has put up three large plasma screens -lrb- costing six grand to hire -rrb- for us to watch whatever matches we like -lrb- and wimbledon too -rrb- .
i reckon a fifth of the company watched the argentina match .
so whilst this represents a lot in lost earnings , it does create a hell of a lot more respect for management and thus in the long term costs will doubtless be recouped .
jon , uk i swapped my shift to a ' late ' so i can stay in bed for the match and be at work for 11:00 .
if they play like they did against sweden i 'll probably fall back to sleep , but if they play like they did against argentina i 'm worried my bed springs wo n't be able to take me jumping up and down for 90 minutes .
billy , uk this is one of the better timed games tony hughes , usa this is one of the better timed games .
it 's on at 11:00 here in california , and it 's on live so me and the family will be glued to the set praying that england do n't mess things up .
nigeria will not be easy but there is something different about the england team this time around , come on england ! ! ! ! ! ! !
tony hughes , usa i 'll be watching the match down here in chile , five-hour time difference with the uk !
i 'm welsh , but i 'll be supporting england all the way .
lesley pulsford , chile , south america ha .
i 'll be watching re-runs on espn over here .
biggest sporting event in the world and the americans barely notice .
oh well , at least a couple of the england games are live .
bah .

they say the attacks were on two of the camps where hundreds of thousands of ugandans have been forced to stay because of the 16-year war .
the attacks come at a time when the ugandan army has deployed thousands of troops inside southern sudan with the co-operation of the khartoum government in an attempt to defeat the rebels .
according to military sources , the rebels attacked cwero camp , which lies 30 kilometres from gulu town on the road to kitgum , at dawn on wednesday .
civilian camps the rebels , under the command of vincent otti , abducted 24 civilians and looted food from trading centres .
thousands of children have been abducted by lra rebels it is not known if the civilians were abducted simply to carry the loot , in which case they are likely to be released , or whether they have been taken as long-term recruits into the lra .
military sources have also confirmed that earlier this week close to 100 lra rebels under the command of majoy kwayelo attacked another camp for internally displaced people near the village of pabo , also in gulu district , where they burnt more than 500 huts .
there have been fears expressed that while the ugandan army has 10,000 troops inside southern sudan , it does not have sufficient numbers of troops protecting the civilian camps in northern uganda .
the ugandan army has said it is currently sending troops from the border area to protect the camps and is also pursuing the rebel groups that carried out the attacks .
when about 250 rebels led by vincent otti crossed back into uganda earlier this month , the ugandan army said it knew where they were and was pursuing them .
the rebels then released 100 of the abducted women and children .
but what people are asking now is why the ugandan army has so far failed to find and defeat this group of armed rebels .
on thursday , reports from gulu town said that the situation has been tense in the town due to the sound of gunfire and news of rebel movements .
there are also reports reaching gulu of two rebel ambushes which took place on thursday morning : one in pajule on the road between kitgum and lira where a vehicle was burnt and a civilian killed , and a second in lacek-ocot in pader district where one woman and a child are reported to have been killed .

instead , it is employees on the inside who are most likely to cause security breaches by inadvertently spreading viruses , defrauding their employer , wasting time on the net or downloading inappropriate material .
figures collated by computer forensics and investigation company vogon suggest that every year one in every 500 employees will cause or trigger a major incident , be it a virus outbreak , attempted theft or accidental data deletion .
bbc news online attended vogon 's annual enemy within seminar to find out the risks employees pose and the best way to manage or investigate the use and abuse of computers .
hidden pornography typically , vogon is invited in to help a company but it also regularly receives tip-offs via its whistleblower website .
the allegations sent to this site include everything from people using fast net connections at work to download pirated software , run their own web business or to look at pornography . "
systems can be compromised through ignorance as well as intent " kathryn own , vogon such serious allegations are not rare .
many people use their work computer to look at materials of an obscene and criminal nature .
chris watts , a senior investigator for vogon , said that about 95 % of the hard disks that the company scans during investigations have pornography on them .
not all of them were illegal images , he said , but the majority broke company policies on appropriate use .
finding facts to avoid employees causing such problems , companies needed to spell out the rights and wrongs of computer use as people joined , said kathryn owen , one of vogon 's investigators .
" it 's important that people sign up to these policies .
then they know that when they come to work for you that these are the rules , " she said .
but employees do not just cause problems by looking at images that break laws or contravene workplace policies .
a lack of common sense can also cause huge problems .
many computer viruses travel by e-mail and conceal their malicious payload in an attached file .
the most successful viruses trick people into opening attachments by using a teasing or salacious subject line .
" systems can be compromised through ignorance as well as intent , " said ms owen .
vogon investigators tell the story of one enterprising employee at one client who tried to take apart the magistr virus to see if it could be used to spread marketing information to customers .
his programming knowledge did not match his creativity and he triggered the virus as he was dismantling it .
the result was a virus outbreak and disciplinary action .
accident ahead vogon is often called in to help recover data thought to be lost when back-up files or tapes prove to be faulty or by someone deleting something they should not .
thankfully , data on hard disks is relatively difficult to completely destroy .
vogon has developed a series of tools that help it recover supposedly lost or deleted data from hard disks .
although virus outbreaks can cause huge disruption and be hard to clean up after , far more damage can be done by those deliberately trying to defraud their employer .
ms owen said that many organisations seeded their customer database with false names to ensure they knew if any rivals got hold of the list of contacts .
vogon also investigated a company in which one employee created a duplicate set of accounts to hide evidence of embezzling and distinguished between the two using files names that differed only because one had two spaces between the words in it rather than one .
vogon said it was relatively straightforward to recreate incriminating information that others has tried to destroy .
this is done by using data from proxy or mail servers , the caches and history files of web browsers , and the slack and free space on hard disks .
