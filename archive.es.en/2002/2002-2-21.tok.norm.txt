four years ago , the company built a command centre for its enron energy services -lrb- ees -rrb- power supply arm , and ordered staff to pretend they were doing deals as analysts gathered in houston for their annual meeting with the firm .
ees later went on to be an active part of the business , but former chairman kenneth lay and ex-president jeffrey skilling rehearsed staff in looking busy , in the hope of convincing investors that it was already a going concern in 1998 .
the revelations come in an interview with joseph phelan , an ex-director of ees , published by the reuters news agency .
they are not the first time that former staff have alleged being persuaded to fake activity when visitors dropped by enron 's houston headquarters .
pretend profits ?
ees was intended to be the powerhouse of enron 's business .
it promised to manage the energy needs of large corporations for a flat fee , an area that was seen as highly promising .
although ees eventually became profitable , it had only a tiny handful of customers and staff in 1998 .
mr phelan said that staff were brought in from other floors to the ees " war room " , and telephone calls into the centre were scheduled in order to create a buzz .
the whole operation was carefully choreographed in order to provide the most buoyant impression on analysts .
probes persist regulators , investigators and politicians are currently trying to piece together exactly what was fact , and what fiction , in enron 's business practices .
although the deceptions allegedly practised at ees were not illegal , they are seen as part of a culture of dishonesty that culminated in the misleading accounting that ultimately brought the firm down last year .
the failed firm 's critics argue that enron was an organisation rotten to the core , where malpractice was inculcated by mr lay and mr skilling .
enron 's defenders , on the other hand , say that any malpractice was the work of unscrupulous individuals .
enron has refused to comment on mr phelan 's comments .

mr blair was responding to the results of the bbc 's your nhs day poll , which suggested 69 % of people want taxes specifically ring fenced for the nhs .
the prime minister rejected those calls for what are known as " hypothecated " taxes but gave a clear hint that tax hikes were ahead .
if we are raising money from people to give pay for a better healthcare system , it should be clear that the money is going to a dedicated healthcare budget tony blair he said : " when we come to this year 's budget we have said that we favour making it clear that if we are raising money from people to give pay for a better healthcare system , it should be clear that the money is going to a dedicated healthcare budget . "
general taxation , rather than social insurance or more nhs charges , was the best way to finance britain 's healthcare , he added .
the government has ruled out raising the basic or higher rate of income tax so it is more likely the rises will come through national insurance or indirect taxes .
mr blair 's comments came as the conservatives and liberal democrats blamed ministers for a jump in the number of people being re-admitted to hospital just weeks after being discharged .
the prime minister said there were huge challenges ahead for the health service but progress was being made .
performance criticism he argued the government 's programme of investment alongside reform would make the nhs " significantly " better in five years time .
" this is n't a system in my view that is fundamentally flawed , it is a system that has not had the resources and investment it requires , " he said .
" and with that investment needs to come fundamental change in order to redesign the service for today 's world . "
shadow health secretary liam fox said the government currently had " targets for everything and priorities for nothing " and was politicising the nhs .
blair says general taxation is the best way to fund the nhs instead , more power should rest with local nhs managers , he argued .
liberal democrat health spokesman evan harris said the health service was still under funded , flagging up his party 's wish to put an extra 10pence on the top rate of income tax .
a phone-in poll for your nhs day suggested free long-term care of the elderly should be a top priority for the nhs than any other issue , the latest results from a bbc poll for nhs day show .
people had been asked to vote on their top priority from a list of 12 options based on the results of a poll of more than 1,000 people conducted for the bbc by polling company icm .
the five top priorities were : free long-term care for the elderly - 73,402 votes more pay for nhs staff -28,434 votes improve a & e - 15,639 votes reduce waits for heart and cancer treatment -17,292 votes cleaner hospitals -11,064 votes the findings may embarrass the british government as personal care for the elderly is provided free in scotland by the scottish executive through local authorities .
but mr blair said doing the same in england would cost £ 1bn , money ministers believed was better spent elsewhere .
support for staff an extra 130,000 elderly people were being helped to live independently in their own homes , he said .
there were also moves for rehabilitation beds for those who did not need to be in hospital any longer but who did not want to go into care homes .
mr blair suggested the icm poll , which put waiting lists as the main issue , was more scientific and the government was making progress in that area .

four years ago , the company built a command centre for its enron energy services -lrb- ees -rrb- power supply arm , and ordered staff to pretend they were doing deals as analysts gathered in houston for their annual meeting with the firm .
ees later went on to be an active part of the business , but former chairman kenneth lay and ex-president jeffrey skilling rehearsed staff in looking busy , in the hope of convincing investors that it was already a going concern in 1998 .
the revelations come in an interview with joseph phelan , an ex-director of ees , published by the reuters news agency .
they are not the first time that former staff have alleged being persuaded to fake activity when visitors dropped by enron 's houston headquarters .
pretend profits ?
ees was intended to be the powerhouse of enron 's business .
kenneth lay allegedly drilled staff in fake work it promised to manage the energy needs of large corporations for a flat fee , an area that was seen as highly promising .
although ees eventually became profitable , it had only a tiny handful of customers and staff in 1998 .
mr phelan said that staff were brought in from other floors to the ees " war room " , and telephone calls into the centre were scheduled in order to create a buzz .
the whole operation was carefully choreographed in order to provide the most buoyant impression on analysts .
probes persist regulators , investigators and politicians are currently trying to piece together exactly what was fact , and what fiction , in enron 's business practices .
enron 's houston hq although the deceptions allegedly practised at ees were not illegal , they are seen as part of a culture of dishonesty that culminated in the misleading accounting that ultimately brought the firm down last year .
the failed firm 's critics argue that enron was an organisation rotten to the core , where malpractice was inculcated by mr lay and mr skilling .
enron 's defenders , on the other hand , say that any malpractice was the work of unscrupulous individuals .
enron has refused to comment on mr phelan 's comments . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's lesley curwen " the make believe command centre apparently cost about $ 500,000 to fit out . "
