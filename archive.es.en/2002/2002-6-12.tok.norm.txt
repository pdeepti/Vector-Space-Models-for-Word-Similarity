expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less . the extent to which the european union will provide agricultural subsidies to new member countries as the eu expands eastward is fast becoming a sticking point in enlarging the 16-member group .
some of the eu 's biggest net contributors - including germany , great britain , the netherlands and sweden - are resisting making direct-subsidy payments to farmers in the 10 countries set to begin joining the eu in 2004 . second-class citizens ?
the future eu members are n't happy either .
major farming countries like poland say that if they are n't given the same subsidies and status as current eu nations , they 'll be treated like second-class citizens .
at a meeting of agricultural ministers in luxembourg earlier this week , germany and other key eu financial backers signalled they did not want to add the countries to the eu 's common agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the eu 's overall budget , until after 2006 .
the current agenda 2000 policy was agreed to in berlin in 1999 and will remain on the books through 2006 .
the opponents say that direct payments to the new members were not foreseen at those meetings in berlin .
additionally , a mid-term review is due this july from european agriculture commissioner franz fischler , and germany and the netherlands are calling for structural reforms to the agricultural policy at that time , including cuts in existing direct subsidies .
the german government , which with 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- a year in support payments is the eu 's largest financial backer , has said it is not willing write a blank check for agricultural subsidies as the eu accepts new members in 2004 .
an eu compromise the eu commission earlier this year proposed giving each of the new members 25 percent of the subsidies allocated from the union 's € 40 billion -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- annual agriculture budget before phasing in full subsidies after 10 years .
that proposal is being supported by the eleven other eu members , including france and spain .
however , the german government fears that overly generous subsidies could discourage eastern european countries from tackling much-needed agricultural reforms that would make their farmers more efficient .
german politicians also worry that expanded eu agricultural subsidies could further tax the federal budget . " you ca n't just send a ' blue letter ' to the german government , " demanding that it reduce its public deficit , " and then turn around and then expect higher contributions from it , " german foreign ministry undersecretary gunter pleuger said earlier this week , referring to pressure the eu has placed on germany to bring its federal budget in line .
conflicting positions but farmers in germany , who themselves rely on subsidies from the eu to make ends meet , have mixed feelings about eastward expansion .
" there are two conflicting positions for farmers , " hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers ' association in brussels told dw-world .
on the one side , he said , a large portion of the $ 9.5 billion the german government pays to brussels each year goes to subsidies for france , italy and spain . " still , we also know that german farmers can not not survive without direct payments . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.06.2002 bizarre campaign aims at young voters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poster reads , " 10,000 watts pulsating through the body and still nothing to confess " it 's election time again and the german parliament is out to mobilise young voters with an elaborate ad campaign that looks like a . phone-sex advertisement ? the campaign is called " entscheidung für freiheit , " or making a choice for freedom .
the idea is that young people should realise the advantages of a democratic society and make their voices heard by voting .
that 's the message that the different political parties represented in parliament are trying to get across .
they want to avoid the extremist parties getting a disproportionate share of the votes because of voter apathy .
but the campaign did n't get off to a smooth start as some members of parliament were shocked with the artistic concept .
it was developed by a group of students and the politicians claim they did n't have a say .
the campaign has three poster themes that are to be pasted on billboards all over germany .
the first of the three pictures is where the controversy comes to a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say at first glance it looks like a phone-sex ad it 's a picture of a smiling young woman sitting on the floor and talking on the phone .
across the picture are the words , " flirting , criticising , gossiping and no one is listening in on me . "
it 's only after the reader notices the smaller text underneath that the point becomes clear about people 's right to privacy in germany 's democratic society .
critics say , at first glance the poster looks like a telephone sex-ad and seems to have nothing to do with voting .
the second of the three posters is also confusing at first but it does n't have any sexual overtones .
it 's a headshot of a young man making a face as if he 's screaming .
it 's not obviously clear if he 's at a party having fun or being tortured .
the caption reads , " 10,000 watts pulsating through the body and still nothing to confess " .
the finer print bellow explains how no one can be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment .
the third is a close up of a young man throwing a ball right at the camera and the caption is , " shooting without blood " .
the explaination is due to strickt regulations , not everyone can carry weapons .
what politicians are saying cdu party delegate , heiner geissler , thinks the whole campaign is counter-productive .
rolf kutzmutz , deputy leader of the parliamentary faction of the post communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- , said if they had seen the pictures before they were published , then his party never would have agreed to them .
he also believes that " anyone , even those who occasionally read the newspapers , will know they are being taken for a ride " .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- echo his criticism .
parliamentary president wolfgang thierse quickly brushed the criticism aside and claimed the critics had just misunderstood the campaign .
getting young people to vote is difficult generally , it 's never been easy to rally young voters to take political action .
according to statistics provided by the organisation of the promotion of political understanding , young voters -lrb- ages 18 to 24 -rrb- normally do n't vote because they feel they are n't well enough informed .
for the upcoming election , 2.5 million people will be first-time voters , which is four percent of the voting population . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election pep talk for the social democrats with less than four months before the german national election , chancellor gerhard schröder rallied his social democrats and persuaded them they can stay in power even though they ’ re currently lagging in the polls -lrb- june 3 , 2002 -rrb- german politicians adopt american campaign tactics as germany prepares for national elections in september , berlin 's power brokers are adopting washington-style spin and slick images to market their candidates for chancellor -lrb- may 21 , 2002 -rrb- .

expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less . the extent to which the european union will provide agricultural subsidies to new member countries as the eu expands eastward is fast becoming a sticking point in enlarging the 16-member group .
some of the eu 's biggest net contributors - including germany , great britain , the netherlands and sweden - are resisting making direct-subsidy payments to farmers in the 10 countries set to begin joining the eu in 2004 . second-class citizens ?
the future eu members are n't happy either .
major farming countries like poland say that if they are n't given the same subsidies and status as current eu nations , they 'll be treated like second-class citizens .
at a meeting of agricultural ministers in luxembourg earlier this week , germany and other key eu financial backers signalled they did not want to add the countries to the eu 's common agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the eu 's overall budget , until after 2006 .
the current agenda 2000 policy was agreed to in berlin in 1999 and will remain on the books through 2006 .
the opponents say that direct payments to the new members were not foreseen at those meetings in berlin .
additionally , a mid-term review is due this july from european agriculture commissioner franz fischler , and germany and the netherlands are calling for structural reforms to the agricultural policy at that time , including cuts in existing direct subsidies .
the german government , which with 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- a year in support payments is the eu 's largest financial backer , has said it is not willing write a blank check for agricultural subsidies as the eu accepts new members in 2004 .
an eu compromise the eu commission earlier this year proposed giving each of the new members 25 percent of the subsidies allocated from the union 's € 40 billion -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- annual agriculture budget before phasing in full subsidies after 10 years .
that proposal is being supported by the eleven other eu members , including france and spain .
however , the german government fears that overly generous subsidies could discourage eastern european countries from tackling much-needed agricultural reforms that would make their farmers more efficient .
german politicians also worry that expanded eu agricultural subsidies could further tax the federal budget . " you ca n't just send a ' blue letter ' to the german government , " demanding that it reduce its public deficit , " and then turn around and then expect higher contributions from it , " german foreign ministry undersecretary gunter pleuger said earlier this week , referring to pressure the eu has placed on germany to bring its federal budget in line .
conflicting positions but farmers in germany , who themselves rely on subsidies from the eu to make ends meet , have mixed feelings about eastward expansion .
" there are two conflicting positions for farmers , " hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers ' association in brussels told dw-world .
on the one side , he said , a large portion of the $ 9.5 billion the german government pays to brussels each year goes to subsidies for france , italy and spain . " still , we also know that german farmers can not not survive without direct payments . "

major farming countries like poland say that if they are n't given the same subsidies and status as current eu nations , they 'll be treated like second-class citizens .
at a meeting of agricultural ministers in luxembourg earlier this week , germany and other key eu financial backers signalled they did not want to add the countries to the eu 's common agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the eu 's overall budget , until after 2006 .
the current agenda 2000 policy was agreed to in berlin in 1999 and will remain on the books through 2006 .
the opponents say that direct payments to the new members were not foreseen at those meetings in berlin .
additionally , a mid-term review is due this july from european agriculture commissioner franz fischler , and germany and the netherlands are calling for structural reforms to the agricultural policy at that time , including cuts in existing direct subsidies .
the german government , which with 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- a year in support payments is the eu 's largest financial backer , has said it is not willing write a blank check for agricultural subsidies as the eu accepts new members in 2004 .
an eu compromise the eu commission earlier this year proposed giving each of the new members 25 percent of the subsidies allocated from the union 's € 40 billion -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- annual agriculture budget before phasing in full subsidies after 10 years .
that proposal is being supported by the eleven other eu members , including france and spain .
however , the german government fears that overly generous subsidies could discourage eastern european countries from tackling much-needed agricultural reforms that would make their farmers more efficient .
german politicians also worry that expanded eu agricultural subsidies could further tax the federal budget . " you ca n't just send a ' blue letter ' to the german government , " demanding that it reduce its public deficit , " and then turn around and then expect higher contributions from it , " german foreign ministry undersecretary gunter pleuger said earlier this week , referring to pressure the eu has placed on germany to bring its federal budget in line .
conflicting positions but farmers in germany , who themselves rely on subsidies from the eu to make ends meet , have mixed feelings about eastward expansion .
" there are two conflicting positions for farmers , " hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers ' association in brussels told dw-world .
on the one side , he said , a large portion of the $ 9.5 billion the german government pays to brussels each year goes to subsidies for france , italy and spain . " still , we also know that german farmers can not not survive without direct payments . "

the idea is that young people should realise the advantages of a democratic society and make their voices heard by voting .
that 's the message that the different political parties represented in parliament are trying to get across .
they want to avoid the extremist parties getting a disproportionate share of the votes because of voter apathy .
but the campaign did n't get off to a smooth start as some members of parliament were shocked with the artistic concept .
it was developed by a group of students and the politicians claim they did n't have a say .
the campaign has three poster themes that are to be pasted on billboards all over germany .
the first of the three pictures is where the controversy comes to a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say at first glance it looks like a phone-sex ad it 's a picture of a smiling young woman sitting on the floor and talking on the phone .
across the picture are the words , " flirting , criticising , gossiping and no one is listening in on me . "
it 's only after the reader notices the smaller text underneath that the point becomes clear about people 's right to privacy in germany 's democratic society .
critics say , at first glance the poster looks like a telephone sex-ad and seems to have nothing to do with voting .

the caption reads , " 10,000 watts pulsating through the body and still nothing to confess " .
the finer print bellow explains how no one can be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment .
the third is a close up of a young man throwing a ball right at the camera and the caption is , " shooting without blood " .
the explaination is due to strickt regulations , not everyone can carry weapons .
what politicians are saying cdu party delegate , heiner geissler , thinks the whole campaign is counter-productive .
rolf kutzmutz , deputy leader of the parliamentary faction of the post communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- , said if they had seen the pictures before they were published , then his party never would have agreed to them .
he also believes that " anyone , even those who occasionally read the newspapers , will know they are being taken for a ride " .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- echo his criticism .
parliamentary president wolfgang thierse quickly brushed the criticism aside and claimed the critics had just misunderstood the campaign .
getting young people to vote is difficult generally , it 's never been easy to rally young voters to take political action .
according to statistics provided by the organisation of the promotion of political understanding , young voters -lrb- ages 18 to 24 -rrb- normally do n't vote because they feel they are n't well enough informed .

the idea is that young people should realise the advantages of a democratic society and make their voices heard by voting .
that 's the message that the different political parties represented in parliament are trying to get across .
they want to avoid the extremist parties getting a disproportionate share of the votes because of voter apathy .
but the campaign did n't get off to a smooth start as some members of parliament were shocked with the artistic concept .
it was developed by a group of students and the politicians claim they did n't have a say .
the campaign has three poster themes that are to be pasted on billboards all over germany .
the first of the three pictures is where the controversy comes to a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say at first glance it looks like a phone-sex ad it 's a picture of a smiling young woman sitting on the floor and talking on the phone .
across the picture are the words , " flirting , criticising , gossiping and no one is listening in on me . "
it 's only after the reader notices the smaller text underneath that the point becomes clear about people 's right to privacy in germany 's democratic society .
critics say , at first glance the poster looks like a telephone sex-ad and seems to have nothing to do with voting .
the second of the three posters is also confusing at first but it does n't have any sexual overtones .
it 's a headshot of a young man making a face as if he 's screaming .
it 's not obviously clear if he 's at a party having fun or being tortured .
the caption reads , " 10,000 watts pulsating through the body and still nothing to confess " .
the finer print bellow explains how no one can be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment .
the third is a close up of a young man throwing a ball right at the camera and the caption is , " shooting without blood " .
the explaination is due to strickt regulations , not everyone can carry weapons .
what politicians are saying cdu party delegate , heiner geissler , thinks the whole campaign is counter-productive .
rolf kutzmutz , deputy leader of the parliamentary faction of the post communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- , said if they had seen the pictures before they were published , then his party never would have agreed to them .
he also believes that " anyone , even those who occasionally read the newspapers , will know they are being taken for a ride " .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- echo his criticism .
parliamentary president wolfgang thierse quickly brushed the criticism aside and claimed the critics had just misunderstood the campaign .

expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less . the extent to which the european union will provide agricultural subsidies to new member countries as the eu expands eastward is fast becoming a sticking point in enlarging the 16-member group .
some of the eu 's biggest net contributors - including germany , great britain , the netherlands and sweden - are resisting making direct-subsidy payments to farmers in the 10 countries set to begin joining the eu in 2004 . second-class citizens ?
the future eu members are n't happy either .
major farming countries like poland say that if they are n't given the same subsidies and status as current eu nations , they 'll be treated like second-class citizens .
at a meeting of agricultural ministers in luxembourg earlier this week , germany and other key eu financial backers signalled they did not want to add the countries to the eu 's common agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the eu 's overall budget , until after 2006 .
the current agenda 2000 policy was agreed to in berlin in 1999 and will remain on the books through 2006 .
the opponents say that direct payments to the new members were not foreseen at those meetings in berlin .
additionally , a mid-term review is due this july from european agriculture commissioner franz fischler , and germany and the netherlands are calling for structural reforms to the agricultural policy at that time , including cuts in existing direct subsidies .
the german government , which with 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- a year in support payments is the eu 's largest financial backer , has said it is not willing write a blank check for agricultural subsidies as the eu accepts new members in 2004 .
an eu compromise the eu commission earlier this year proposed giving each of the new members 25 percent of the subsidies allocated from the union 's € 40 billion -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- annual agriculture budget before phasing in full subsidies after 10 years .
that proposal is being supported by the eleven other eu members , including france and spain .
however , the german government fears that overly generous subsidies could discourage eastern european countries from tackling much-needed agricultural reforms that would make their farmers more efficient .
german politicians also worry that expanded eu agricultural subsidies could further tax the federal budget . " you ca n't just send a ' blue letter ' to the german government , " demanding that it reduce its public deficit , " and then turn around and then expect higher contributions from it , " german foreign ministry undersecretary gunter pleuger said earlier this week , referring to pressure the eu has placed on germany to bring its federal budget in line .
conflicting positions but farmers in germany , who themselves rely on subsidies from the eu to make ends meet , have mixed feelings about eastward expansion .
" there are two conflicting positions for farmers , " hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers ' association in brussels told dw-world .
on the one side , he said , a large portion of the $ 9.5 billion the german government pays to brussels each year goes to subsidies for france , italy and spain . " still , we also know that german farmers can not not survive without direct payments . "

some of the eu 's biggest net contributors - including germany , great britain , the netherlands and sweden - are resisting making direct-subsidy payments to farmers in the 10 countries set to begin joining the eu in 2004 . second-class citizens ?
the future eu members are n't happy either .
major farming countries like poland say that if they are n't given the same subsidies and status as current eu nations , they 'll be treated like second-class citizens .
at a meeting of agricultural ministers in luxembourg earlier this week , germany and other key eu financial backers signalled they did not want to add the countries to the eu 's common agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the eu 's overall budget , until after 2006 .
the current agenda 2000 policy was agreed to in berlin in 1999 and will remain on the books through 2006 .
the opponents say that direct payments to the new members were not foreseen at those meetings in berlin .
additionally , a mid-term review is due this july from european agriculture commissioner franz fischler , and germany and the netherlands are calling for structural reforms to the agricultural policy at that time , including cuts in existing direct subsidies .
the german government , which with 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- a year in support payments is the eu 's largest financial backer , has said it is not willing write a blank check for agricultural subsidies as the eu accepts new members in 2004 .
an eu compromise the eu commission earlier this year proposed giving each of the new members 25 percent of the subsidies allocated from the union 's € 40 billion -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- annual agriculture budget before phasing in full subsidies after 10 years .
that proposal is being supported by the eleven other eu members , including france and spain .
however , the german government fears that overly generous subsidies could discourage eastern european countries from tackling much-needed agricultural reforms that would make their farmers more efficient .
german politicians also worry that expanded eu agricultural subsidies could further tax the federal budget . " you ca n't just send a ' blue letter ' to the german government , " demanding that it reduce its public deficit , " and then turn around and then expect higher contributions from it , " german foreign ministry undersecretary gunter pleuger said earlier this week , referring to pressure the eu has placed on germany to bring its federal budget in line .

" there are two conflicting positions for farmers , " hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers ' association in brussels told dw-world .
on the one side , he said , a large portion of the $ 9.5 billion the german government pays to brussels each year goes to subsidies for france , italy and spain . " still , we also know that german farmers can not not survive without direct payments . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.06.2002 bizarre campaign aims at young voters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poster reads , " 10,000 watts pulsating through the body and still nothing to confess " it 's election time again and the german parliament is out to mobilise young voters with an elaborate ad campaign that looks like a . phone-sex advertisement ? the campaign is called " entscheidung für freiheit , " or making a choice for freedom .
the idea is that young people should realise the advantages of a democratic society and make their voices heard by voting .
that 's the message that the different political parties represented in parliament are trying to get across .
they want to avoid the extremist parties getting a disproportionate share of the votes because of voter apathy .
but the campaign did n't get off to a smooth start as some members of parliament were shocked with the artistic concept .
it was developed by a group of students and the politicians claim they did n't have a say .
the campaign has three poster themes that are to be pasted on billboards all over germany .
the first of the three pictures is where the controversy comes to a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say at first glance it looks like a phone-sex ad it 's a picture of a smiling young woman sitting on the floor and talking on the phone .
across the picture are the words , " flirting , criticising , gossiping and no one is listening in on me . "
it 's only after the reader notices the smaller text underneath that the point becomes clear about people 's right to privacy in germany 's democratic society .
critics say , at first glance the poster looks like a telephone sex-ad and seems to have nothing to do with voting .
the second of the three posters is also confusing at first but it does n't have any sexual overtones .
it 's a headshot of a young man making a face as if he 's screaming .
it 's not obviously clear if he 's at a party having fun or being tortured .
the caption reads , " 10,000 watts pulsating through the body and still nothing to confess " .
the finer print bellow explains how no one can be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment .
the third is a close up of a young man throwing a ball right at the camera and the caption is , " shooting without blood " .
the explaination is due to strickt regulations , not everyone can carry weapons .
what politicians are saying cdu party delegate , heiner geissler , thinks the whole campaign is counter-productive .
rolf kutzmutz , deputy leader of the parliamentary faction of the post communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- , said if they had seen the pictures before they were published , then his party never would have agreed to them .
he also believes that " anyone , even those who occasionally read the newspapers , will know they are being taken for a ride " .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- echo his criticism .
parliamentary president wolfgang thierse quickly brushed the criticism aside and claimed the critics had just misunderstood the campaign .

the idea is that young people should realise the advantages of a democratic society and make their voices heard by voting .
that 's the message that the different political parties represented in parliament are trying to get across .
they want to avoid the extremist parties getting a disproportionate share of the votes because of voter apathy .
but the campaign did n't get off to a smooth start as some members of parliament were shocked with the artistic concept .
it was developed by a group of students and the politicians claim they did n't have a say .
the campaign has three poster themes that are to be pasted on billboards all over germany .
the first of the three pictures is where the controversy comes to a point .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say at first glance it looks like a phone-sex ad it 's a picture of a smiling young woman sitting on the floor and talking on the phone .
across the picture are the words , " flirting , criticising , gossiping and no one is listening in on me . "
it 's only after the reader notices the smaller text underneath that the point becomes clear about people 's right to privacy in germany 's democratic society .
critics say , at first glance the poster looks like a telephone sex-ad and seems to have nothing to do with voting .
the second of the three posters is also confusing at first but it does n't have any sexual overtones .
it 's a headshot of a young man making a face as if he 's screaming .
it 's not obviously clear if he 's at a party having fun or being tortured .
the caption reads , " 10,000 watts pulsating through the body and still nothing to confess " .
the finer print bellow explains how no one can be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment .
the third is a close up of a young man throwing a ball right at the camera and the caption is , " shooting without blood " .
the explaination is due to strickt regulations , not everyone can carry weapons .
what politicians are saying cdu party delegate , heiner geissler , thinks the whole campaign is counter-productive .
rolf kutzmutz , deputy leader of the parliamentary faction of the post communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- , said if they had seen the pictures before they were published , then his party never would have agreed to them .
he also believes that " anyone , even those who occasionally read the newspapers , will know they are being taken for a ride " .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- echo his criticism .

expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less . the extent to which the european union will provide agricultural subsidies to new member countries as the eu expands eastward is fast becoming a sticking point in enlarging the 16-member group .
some of the eu 's biggest net contributors - including germany , great britain , the netherlands and sweden - are resisting making direct-subsidy payments to farmers in the 10 countries set to begin joining the eu in 2004 . second-class citizens ?
the future eu members are n't happy either .
major farming countries like poland say that if they are n't given the same subsidies and status as current eu nations , they 'll be treated like second-class citizens .
at a meeting of agricultural ministers in luxembourg earlier this week , germany and other key eu financial backers signalled they did not want to add the countries to the eu 's common agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the eu 's overall budget , until after 2006 .
the current agenda 2000 policy was agreed to in berlin in 1999 and will remain on the books through 2006 .
the opponents say that direct payments to the new members were not foreseen at those meetings in berlin .
additionally , a mid-term review is due this july from european agriculture commissioner franz fischler , and germany and the netherlands are calling for structural reforms to the agricultural policy at that time , including cuts in existing direct subsidies .
the german government , which with 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- a year in support payments is the eu 's largest financial backer , has said it is not willing write a blank check for agricultural subsidies as the eu accepts new members in 2004 .
an eu compromise the eu commission earlier this year proposed giving each of the new members 25 percent of the subsidies allocated from the union 's € 40 billion -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- annual agriculture budget before phasing in full subsidies after 10 years .
that proposal is being supported by the eleven other eu members , including france and spain .
however , the german government fears that overly generous subsidies could discourage eastern european countries from tackling much-needed agricultural reforms that would make their farmers more efficient .
german politicians also worry that expanded eu agricultural subsidies could further tax the federal budget . " you ca n't just send a ' blue letter ' to the german government , " demanding that it reduce its public deficit , " and then turn around and then expect higher contributions from it , " german foreign ministry undersecretary gunter pleuger said earlier this week , referring to pressure the eu has placed on germany to bring its federal budget in line .
conflicting positions but farmers in germany , who themselves rely on subsidies from the eu to make ends meet , have mixed feelings about eastward expansion .
" there are two conflicting positions for farmers , " hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers ' association in brussels told dw-world .
on the one side , he said , a large portion of the $ 9.5 billion the german government pays to brussels each year goes to subsidies for france , italy and spain . " still , we also know that german farmers can not not survive without direct payments . "
with germany in the midst of an election year , it is unlikely - despite pressure from france and other countries - that the issue will be resolved before er an eu expansion summit in copenhagen this december . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-subsidies a sticking point at wto talks european union farmers dug in their heels against phasing out agriculture export subsidies , a key issue as world trade organisation members struggle over a declaration to launch new world trade talks .

expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less . the extent to which the european union will provide agricultural subsidies to new member countries as the eu expands eastward is fast becoming a sticking point in enlarging the 16-member group .
some of the eu 's biggest net contributors - including germany , great britain , the netherlands and sweden - are resisting making direct-subsidy payments to farmers in the 10 countries set to begin joining the eu in 2004 . second-class citizens ?
the future eu members are n't happy either .
major farming countries like poland say that if they are n't given the same subsidies and status as current eu nations , they 'll be treated like second-class citizens .
at a meeting of agricultural ministers in luxembourg earlier this week , germany and other key eu financial backers signalled they did not want to add the countries to the eu 's common agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the eu 's overall budget , until after 2006 .
the current agenda 2000 policy was agreed to in berlin in 1999 and will remain on the books through 2006 .
the opponents say that direct payments to the new members were not foreseen at those meetings in berlin .
additionally , a mid-term review is due this july from european agriculture commissioner franz fischler , and germany and the netherlands are calling for structural reforms to the agricultural policy at that time , including cuts in existing direct subsidies .
the german government , which with 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- a year in support payments is the eu 's largest financial backer , has said it is not willing write a blank check for agricultural subsidies as the eu accepts new members in 2004 .
an eu compromise the eu commission earlier this year proposed giving each of the new members 25 percent of the subsidies allocated from the union 's € 40 billion -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- annual agriculture budget before phasing in full subsidies after 10 years .
that proposal is being supported by the eleven other eu members , including france and spain .
however , the german government fears that overly generous subsidies could discourage eastern european countries from tackling much-needed agricultural reforms that would make their farmers more efficient .
german politicians also worry that expanded eu agricultural subsidies could further tax the federal budget . " you ca n't just send a ' blue letter ' to the german government , " demanding that it reduce its public deficit , " and then turn around and then expect higher contributions from it , " german foreign ministry undersecretary gunter pleuger said earlier this week , referring to pressure the eu has placed on germany to bring its federal budget in line .
conflicting positions but farmers in germany , who themselves rely on subsidies from the eu to make ends meet , have mixed feelings about eastward expansion .
" there are two conflicting positions for farmers , " hans-heinrich berghorn of the german farmers ' association in brussels told dw-world .
on the one side , he said , a large portion of the $ 9.5 billion the german government pays to brussels each year goes to subsidies for france , italy and spain . " still , we also know that german farmers can not not survive without direct payments . "

the idea is that young people should realise the advantages of a democratic society and make their voices heard by voting .
that 's the message that the different political parties represented in parliament are trying to get across .
they want to avoid the extremist parties getting a disproportionate share of the votes because of voter apathy .
but the campaign did n't get off to a smooth start as some members of parliament were shocked with the artistic concept .
it was developed by a group of students and the politicians claim they did n't have a say .
the campaign has three poster themes that are to be pasted on billboards all over germany .
the first of the three pictures is where the controversy comes to a point .

the explaination is due to strickt regulations , not everyone can carry weapons .
what politicians are saying cdu party delegate , heiner geissler , thinks the whole campaign is counter-productive .
rolf kutzmutz , deputy leader of the parliamentary faction of the post communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- , said if they had seen the pictures before they were published , then his party never would have agreed to them .
he also believes that " anyone , even those who occasionally read the newspapers , will know they are being taken for a ride " .
the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- echo his criticism .
parliamentary president wolfgang thierse quickly brushed the criticism aside and claimed the critics had just misunderstood the campaign .
getting young people to vote is difficult generally , it 's never been easy to rally young voters to take political action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.06.2002 agricultural policy a burning issue for eu expansion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany and other countries fear the eu agricultural budget could become a pigsty with eastward expansion .
expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less . the extent to which the european union will provide agricultural subsidies to new member countries as the eu expands eastward is fast becoming a sticking point in enlarging the 16-member group .
some of the eu 's biggest net contributors - including germany , great britain , the netherlands and sweden - are resisting making direct-subsidy payments to farmers in the 10 countries set to begin joining the eu in 2004 . second-class citizens ?
the future eu members are n't happy either .
major farming countries like poland say that if they are n't given the same subsidies and status as current eu nations , they 'll be treated like second-class citizens .
at a meeting of agricultural ministers in luxembourg earlier this week , germany and other key eu financial backers signalled they did not want to add the countries to the eu 's common agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the eu 's overall budget , until after 2006 .
the current agenda 2000 policy was agreed to in berlin in 1999 and will remain on the books through 2006 .
the opponents say that direct payments to the new members were not foreseen at those meetings in berlin .
additionally , a mid-term review is due this july from european agriculture commissioner franz fischler , and germany and the netherlands are calling for structural reforms to the agricultural policy at that time , including cuts in existing direct subsidies .
the german government , which with 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- a year in support payments is the eu 's largest financial backer , has said it is not willing write a blank check for agricultural subsidies as the eu accepts new members in 2004 .
an eu compromise the eu commission earlier this year proposed giving each of the new members 25 percent of the subsidies allocated from the union 's € 40 billion -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- annual agriculture budget before phasing in full subsidies after 10 years .
that proposal is being supported by the eleven other eu members , including france and spain .
however , the german government fears that overly generous subsidies could discourage eastern european countries from tackling much-needed agricultural reforms that would make their farmers more efficient .
german politicians also worry that expanded eu agricultural subsidies could further tax the federal budget . " you ca n't just send a ' blue letter ' to the german government , " demanding that it reduce its public deficit , " and then turn around and then expect higher contributions from it , " german foreign ministry undersecretary gunter pleuger said earlier this week , referring to pressure the eu has placed on germany to bring its federal budget in line .
conflicting positions but farmers in germany , who themselves rely on subsidies from the eu to make ends meet , have mixed feelings about eastward expansion .

the future eu members are n't happy either .
major farming countries like poland say that if they are n't given the same subsidies and status as current eu nations , they 'll be treated like second-class citizens .
at a meeting of agricultural ministers in luxembourg earlier this week , germany and other key eu financial backers signalled they did not want to add the countries to the eu 's common agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the eu 's overall budget , until after 2006 .
the current agenda 2000 policy was agreed to in berlin in 1999 and will remain on the books through 2006 .
the opponents say that direct payments to the new members were not foreseen at those meetings in berlin .
additionally , a mid-term review is due this july from european agriculture commissioner franz fischler , and germany and the netherlands are calling for structural reforms to the agricultural policy at that time , including cuts in existing direct subsidies .
the german government , which with 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- a year in support payments is the eu 's largest financial backer , has said it is not willing write a blank check for agricultural subsidies as the eu accepts new members in 2004 .
an eu compromise the eu commission earlier this year proposed giving each of the new members 25 percent of the subsidies allocated from the union 's € 40 billion -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- annual agriculture budget before phasing in full subsidies after 10 years .
that proposal is being supported by the eleven other eu members , including france and spain .
however , the german government fears that overly generous subsidies could discourage eastern european countries from tackling much-needed agricultural reforms that would make their farmers more efficient .
german politicians also worry that expanded eu agricultural subsidies could further tax the federal budget . " you ca n't just send a ' blue letter ' to the german government , " demanding that it reduce its public deficit , " and then turn around and then expect higher contributions from it , " german foreign ministry undersecretary gunter pleuger said earlier this week , referring to pressure the eu has placed on germany to bring its federal budget in line .

expansion of the european body could hit a road block as candidate countries demand heavy agricultural subsidies while current members , like germany , want to spend less . the extent to which the european union will provide agricultural subsidies to new member countries as the eu expands eastward is fast becoming a sticking point in enlarging the 16-member group .
some of the eu 's biggest net contributors - including germany , great britain , the netherlands and sweden - are resisting making direct-subsidy payments to farmers in the 10 countries set to begin joining the eu in 2004 . second-class citizens ?
the future eu members are n't happy either .
major farming countries like poland say that if they are n't given the same subsidies and status as current eu nations , they 'll be treated like second-class citizens .
at a meeting of agricultural ministers in luxembourg earlier this week , germany and other key eu financial backers signalled they did not want to add the countries to the eu 's common agricultural policy , which comprises nearly half of the eu 's overall budget , until after 2006 .
the current agenda 2000 policy was agreed to in berlin in 1999 and will remain on the books through 2006 .
the opponents say that direct payments to the new members were not foreseen at those meetings in berlin .
additionally , a mid-term review is due this july from european agriculture commissioner franz fischler , and germany and the netherlands are calling for structural reforms to the agricultural policy at that time , including cuts in existing direct subsidies .
the german government , which with 10 billion euro -lrb- $ 9.5 billion -rrb- a year in support payments is the eu 's largest financial backer , has said it is not willing write a blank check for agricultural subsidies as the eu accepts new members in 2004 .
an eu compromise the eu commission earlier this year proposed giving each of the new members 25 percent of the subsidies allocated from the union 's € 40 billion -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- annual agriculture budget before phasing in full subsidies after 10 years .
that proposal is being supported by the eleven other eu members , including france and spain .
however , the german government fears that overly generous subsidies could discourage eastern european countries from tackling much-needed agricultural reforms that would make their farmers more efficient .
german politicians also worry that expanded eu agricultural subsidies could further tax the federal budget . " you ca n't just send a ' blue letter ' to the german government , " demanding that it reduce its public deficit , " and then turn around and then expect higher contributions from it , " german foreign ministry undersecretary gunter pleuger said earlier this week , referring to pressure the eu has placed on germany to bring its federal budget in line .

"
there are n't any formal charges and ... the defence community is outraged " defence lawyer donna newman the arrest of abdullah al-muhajir on 8 may at chicago 's o 'hare international airport was announced by the us government on monday .
representing mr al-muhajir , defence lawyer donna newman has filed a petition questioning the legal basis for classifying her client as an enemy combatant - a term which allows for his indefinite detention without trial .
" he is being detained without time limit , or the right to counsel .
there are n't any formal charges and that is why the defence community is outraged , " she said .
a district court judge said he would consider ms newman 's request on wednesday , but it was n't clear whether the court has any jurisdiction in the case now that the suspect is in military custody .
president george w bush said on tuesday that there was a " full-scale manhunt on " for anyone else believed to be involved in the alleged al-qaeda plot to detonate a radioactive bomb in the us .
military detention mr bush said mr al-muhajir , born jose padilla , had links to the al-qaeda terror group , which the us blames for the 11 september attacks in new york and washington .
how does a dirty bomb work ?
a conventional bomb is packed with radioactive isotopes the force of the explosion spreads radioactive material over a wide area likely to cause radiation sickness in any exposed to the contaminated area massive disruption ensues " this guy , padilla , is a bad guy .
and he is where he needs to be detained , " mr bush said .
mr bush said that us authorities are now hunting down any terror associates mr al-muhajir may have .
" as we run down these killers or would-be killers , we 'll let you know , " he said .
mr al-muhajir , a us citizen of puerto rican descent , has been handed over to the army and is being detained at a military facility in south carolina .
legal quagmire the bbc 's correspondent in washington , alex van wel , says us lawyers are describing mr al-muhajir 's case as a " legal twilight zone " and say there are no precedents which they can apply to work out what his position might be .
our correspondent says civil rights groups are accusing the us of changing mr al-muhajir 's status simply in order to detain him indefinitely without bringing a charge .
the suspect is alleged to have been planning to build and explode the bomb , which can spread material highly toxic to humans .
investigators are said to have known about mr al-muhajir for some time .
officials said he was stopped in the " initial planning stages " and no specific targets had been selected .
in other related developments : the us authorities say 50 more suspected al-qaeda and taleban captives have been flown from afghanistan to the us naval base of guantanamo bay in cuba in recent days , bringing the number of prisoners there to 434 .
a us judge throws out one of the charges against the alleged shoe bomber , richard reid .
the 28-year-old british citizen still faces eight other charges including attempted murder .
the us justice department has proposed stricter controls over the enrolment of foreign pupils at flying schools in america .
under the proposals , foreigners wanting to learn to fly large planes will be screened by the attorney-general 's office .
potential pupils will have to submit fingerprints and provide details about themselves , any criminal records they have , their finances and their family background .

those living in the 70-strong hebridean community say that the spirit and will which was so strong half a decade ago remains strong today .
residents of the island - which is located 10 miles off the scottish mainland , near the fishing port of mallaig - began a concerted campaign for autonomy in the early 1990s .
they were riled first by owner keith schellenberg and then by the absent eccentricity of german artist-proprietor maruma .
events are taking place to mark the anniversary their efforts led to a pioneering buy-out by the community , which went ahead in 1997 .
islanders then began work to restore the fortunes of eigg after many years of neglect .
" it 's hard to remember now , just how bad things were , " said the island 's wildlife warden john chester , who has made his home on the island since 1986 .
" getting something done has only been possible since the buy-out .
" we had conservation plans but without the consent of the landlord nothing could go forward . "
fight back that sense of frustration with landlords was common amongst islanders at the time according to maggie fyffe , secretary of the island 's heritage trust .
she said it was a struggle to fight back .
" there was no support .
all the work done then , and it was a huge amount of work , was done on a voluntary basis , " she recalled .
we do n't always agree about things , but we can work it through and hopefully come up with the right decision maggie fyffe since the buyout the islanders have repaired their homes , built a tea shop and accommodation for visitors and are even developing their own hydro-electric scheme .
maggie fyffe said that was all down to a fantastic sense of community .
" we do n't always agree about things , but we can work it through and hopefully come up with the right decision , " she said .
she pointed out that a number of full-time jobs had been created , including six in a forestry project .
and while it remained a challenge to keep going , she was still cheerful about the island 's prospects .
islander john chester said that getting things right would be essential for the long-term prosperity of eigg .
eigg is located 10 miles off the scottish mainland he agreed that the economy had perked up since the landlords left .
" hopefully it will continue as it is but i do n't think anyone can be sure about west highland economics these days , and obviously eigg is reliant on such things as tourism , " he said .
islanders are now hoping for a good turnout of tourists and friends of the island for the open day which will celebrate the achievements of the last five years .
the events planned for wednesday - the anniversary of the deal - include tours of the renovation projects , an exhibition of photographs of island history and a visit to its famous ' singing sands ' .
the week 's celebrations will culminate with a wild saturday night ceilidh .

american express threatened the ban after ba decided to stop paying fees to the firm when customers paid for flights using corporate amex cards .
american express claimed the move broke an agreement with ba .
but the airline , in a statement made after a legal filing in a new york court , said it did " not believe " it had breached its contract with american express .
" we are keen to resolve this issue . "
reduced fees british airways is trying to reduce booking fees it pays to third parties as it looks to turn around its worst financial performance since privatisation 15 years ago .
almost three-quarters of top british companies use corporate amex cards to pay for travel , so the airline is keen not to lose its relationship with american express .
analysts say it is likely that ba would be prepared to negotiate a reduced fee per booking to american express .

the findings by the national audit office have prompted fears that the denbighshire and newport / monmouthshire coastal authorities would be ill-equipped to handle a major pollution incident .
when the sea empress tanker ran aground at milford haven in 1996 , 72,000 tonnes of crude oil spilled into the estuary , badly damaging the marine environment .
a subsequent inquiry was critical of the events and aftermath of the disaster , and the report called for a tightening up of pollution control .
four other authorities out of 170 in the uk examined are also without emergency plans .
the nao report 's findings have alarmed officials at the world wildlife fund .
denbighshire covers the busy shipping and ferry lanes in the irish sea , while monmouthshire and newport cover the severn estuary , one of the world 's strongest tidal waters .
pollution controls the maritime and coastguard agency - which is responsible for the uk 's coastline - has not received details of contingency plans from either authority .
an agency spokesman said its officials had been told newport was awaiting the preparation of a wider plan covering the severn estuary .
denbighshire - which has dealt with two pollution incidents on its beaches in recent years - has said it would only prepare its emergency plan when proper resources become available .
the nao also found significant parts of the welsh coastline were not properly covered by shipping oil pollution regulations .
the areas omitted include environmentally sensitive areas such as st brides bay , cardigan bay and also the severn estuary and south of the lleyn peninsular .
the world wildlife fund has campaigned vigorously against marine pollution and expressed deep concern about the nao report .
major disaster a wwf spokesperson said pollution control plans should be made a statutory duty for local authorities so they received funding for them .
since 1996 , claims from local businesses and fishermen arising out of the sea empress grounding have reached £ 34m .
the sea empress oil spill was the third-largest tanker spill in uk waters .
around 120 miles of coastline were polluted in the haven and between cardigan bay and pendine sands .
an official inquiry into the disaster partly blamed the inadequate training and inexperience of a port authority pilot .
