this follows the country 's sports authorities last week reinstating the elected executive committee of the national football federation .
a fifa spokesman said his organisation would still be following the situation carefully , but had lifted the suspension until new statutes were adopted and new committee elections held if necessary .

fifa said the sacking of the committee members was a violation of fifa rules .

an australian newspaper , the daily telegraph , reported the government used a top secret defence agency to monitor calls to the ship , the tampa , after it rescued more than 400 mainly afghan asylum seekers from their sinking boat . "
i think it 's outrageous , it 's un-australian and it shows that the government is prepared to stop at nothing " opposition labor leader simon crean the australian government refused to allow the asylum seekers to come ashore .
the newspaper says the government used transcripts of the conversations between the crew and the australian maritime union to form a political response to the crisis .
but the australian government denied the defence agency had overstepped its powers .
' un-australian ' a minister , tony abbott , said the action was reasonable given the threats made by the asylum seekers against the ship 's captain , and the fact that australian troops had boarded the ship .
opposition labor leader simon crean said if the allegations were true , the government 's behaviour had been " outrageous and un-australian " .
the defense signals directorate - part of the defence department - is not meant to pass australian calls to the government except under extreme circumstances , such as serious criminal offences or a threat to the lives and safety of australians .
the 438 boat people rescued by the tampa from a sinking ferry off indonesia on 26 august were prevented during an eight-day stand-off from landing on australia 's indian ocean territory of christmas island .
sas troops boarded the ship and the government later ordered the asylum seekers to be taken to the tiny pacific island nation of nauru to have their claims processed in what became known as its " pacific solution . "

an australian newspaper , the daily telegraph , reported the government used a top secret defence agency to monitor calls to the ship , the tampa , after it rescued more than 400 mainly afghan asylum seekers from their sinking boat .
i think it 's outrageous , it 's un-australian and it shows that the government is prepared to stop at nothing opposition labor leader simon crean the australian government refused to allow the asylum seekers to come ashore .
the newspaper says the government used transcripts of the conversations between the crew and the australian maritime union to form a political response to the crisis .
but the australian government denied the defence agency had overstepped its powers .
' un-australian ' a minister , tony abbott , said the action was reasonable given the threats made by the asylum seekers against the ship 's captain , and the fact that australian troops had boarded the ship .
opposition labor leader simon crean said if the allegations were true , the government 's behaviour had been " outrageous and un-australian " .
the defense signals directorate - part of the defence department - is not meant to pass australian calls to the government except under extreme circumstances , such as serious criminal offences or a threat to the lives and safety of australians .

the uk atomic energy authority -lrb- ukaea -rrb- will announce the move on tuesday as the latest phase in a £ 4bn project to decommission the plant over the next 60 years .
the work will concentrate on the dome-shaped fast reactor at the site .
it is expected that this latest project will create at least 50 jobs .
the ukaea will sign an alliance with six companies to carry out specialised work on the fast reactor .
it has not been in use since the late 1970s but still has 9km of cables which need to be removed .
robots will be used during the project because of the high levels of radiation and the risk of fire posed by chemicals inside the reactor .
the ukaea said that it will be the most complex engineering and environmental challenge of the decommissioning process so far .
closure plans it has described the work as a key phase in the programme to make the entire site safe .
the company expects the operation to cost £ 30m and create at least 50 jobs .
the uk government announced plans to gradually close down the dounreay nuclear plant in 1998 .
ministers took the decision after the ukaea said there was no commercial reason to keep the plant going .
the huge amount of decommissioning work needed to bring the plant 's life to an end means there could be jobs at the site for at least another 100 years .
