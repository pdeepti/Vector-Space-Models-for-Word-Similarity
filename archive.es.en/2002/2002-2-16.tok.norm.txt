mr bush said the kyoto treaty would have put millions of people out of work because of its mandatory reductions .
it was unfair , he said , because it would have penalised the us and exempted many developing countries such as india and china .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- a bad day to bury bad news categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics saturday , 16 february , 2002 , 07:00 gmt a bad day to bury bad news the irony is there for all to see .
it was a story most governments would like buried in the inside pages - but this one had become too big to hide .
the double dramatic resignations of jo moore and martin sixsmith have had implications wider than the immediate loss of their own posts .
stephen byers , the embattled transport secretary , is - according to the financial times - trying to safeguard his position in the cabinet .
but that has not prevented calls for his resignation from those who believe he should have sacked his special advisor at the time of the ' ' infamous " e-mail on 11 september which suggested it was a " good day " to bury bad news .
the express ' political editor , patrick o flynn , argues that if tony blair is serious about restoring standards at the heart of government he must dismiss the man ' ' who repeatedly condoned , defended and encouraged ms moore 's behaviour " .
no choice in an editorial , the daily telegraph says it finds it hard to see how mr byers can continue in office .
as the paper points out , it was not a particularly good day to bury the careers of two spin doctors .
instead , it says , of maintaining a dignified silence on the day of princess margaret 's funeral , a government once famed for its media management found itself with no choice but to generate more damaging headlines in attempt to rescue the situation .
it is a theme echoed in the independent .
the paper says ms moore would have preferred her hurried departure from the transport department to have been ' ' buried " under some sort of world event .
instead , the princess 's funeral was eclipsed by the resignations of ms moore and the ministry 's communications director , mr sixsmith .
dignity a picture of the queen apparently wiping away a tear after the private funeral of her sister , princess margaret , is reproduced in many editions .
so too is a photo of the queen mother being driven away from st george 's chapel in windsor on what the mirror described as one of the saddest days of her life .
the sun says she bore her pain with dignity and control , remaining calm and serene .
meanwhile , the killing afghanistan 's aviation minister has - in the view of the financial times - dealt a blow to the country 's fragile interim government .
the assertion that abdul rahman was not murdered by angry pilgrims but in fact died as the result of a vendetta will - the paper believes - almost certainly extend the stay of international peacekeepers .
rumpus as officials at the winter olympics try to draw a veil over the rumpus surrounding the belated gold medal awarded to canada 's pairs figure skaters - the times ' man at salt lake city has identified a new sport . finding the heirs to eddie the eagle .
thailand 's cross-country skier lost his glasses ; winded himself in a fall and finally gave up after suffering cramps .
india 's luge specialist slid alarmingly close to the edge of the track , causing small flames to leap from his sledge .
while the taiwanese entrant spent most of his run underneath his sledge .
waiter !
finally , the independent reports on the dangers of the introduction of the euro .
but the story 's not so much about a political point - more of a decimal one .
a british customer at a paris restaurant asked for ' ' l 'addition " for his tagliatelle and a glass of wine .
it was only when he got home he realised he had paid a bill of 1,900 euros - well over £ 1,200 -lrb- because the waiter had put the point in the wrong place . -rrb-

it was a story most governments would like buried in the inside pages - but this one had become too big to hide .
the double dramatic resignations of jo moore and martin sixsmith have had implications wider than the immediate loss of their own posts .
stephen byers , the embattled transport secretary , is - according to the financial times - trying to safeguard his position in the cabinet .
but that has not prevented calls for his resignation from those who believe he should have sacked his special advisor at the time of the ' ' infamous " e-mail on 11 september which suggested it was a " good day " to bury bad news .
the express ' political editor , patrick o flynn , argues that if tony blair is serious about restoring standards at the heart of government he must dismiss the man ' ' who repeatedly condoned , defended and encouraged ms moore 's behaviour " .
no choice in an editorial , the daily telegraph says it finds it hard to see how mr byers can continue in office .
as the paper points out , it was not a particularly good day to bury the careers of two spin doctors .
instead , it says , of maintaining a dignified silence on the day of princess margaret 's funeral , a government once famed for its media management found itself with no choice but to generate more damaging headlines in attempt to rescue the situation .
it is a theme echoed in the independent .
the paper says ms moore would have preferred her hurried departure from the transport department to have been ' ' buried " under some sort of world event .
instead , the princess 's funeral was eclipsed by the resignations of ms moore and the ministry 's communications director , mr sixsmith .
dignity a picture of the queen apparently wiping away a tear after the private funeral of her sister , princess margaret , is reproduced in many editions .
so too is a photo of the queen mother being driven away from st george 's chapel in windsor on what the mirror described as one of the saddest days of her life .
the sun says she bore her pain with dignity and control , remaining calm and serene .
meanwhile , the killing afghanistan 's aviation minister has - in the view of the financial times - dealt a blow to the country 's fragile interim government .
the assertion that abdul rahman was not murdered by angry pilgrims but in fact died as the result of a vendetta will - the paper believes - almost certainly extend the stay of international peacekeepers .
rumpus as officials at the winter olympics try to draw a veil over the rumpus surrounding the belated gold medal awarded to canada 's pairs figure skaters - the times ' man at salt lake city has identified a new sport . finding the heirs to eddie the eagle .
thailand 's cross-country skier lost his glasses ; winded himself in a fall and finally gave up after suffering cramps .
india 's luge specialist slid alarmingly close to the edge of the track , causing small flames to leap from his sledge .
while the taiwanese entrant spent most of his run underneath his sledge .
waiter !
finally , the independent reports on the dangers of the introduction of the euro .
but the story 's not so much about a political point - more of a decimal one .
a british customer at a paris restaurant asked for ' ' l 'addition " for his tagliatelle and a glass of wine .
it was only when he got home he realised he had paid a bill of 1,900 euros - well over £ 1,200 -lrb- because the waiter had put the point in the wrong place . -rrb-
