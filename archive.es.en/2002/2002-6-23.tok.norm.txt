the two normally friendly trading nations have been at loggerheads for years over whether canada has illegally subsidised softwood lumber exports - used for home construction - to the us .
pettigrew says us consumers are being hurt canada has denied the charges and recently filed a 31-count complaint with a north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- panel to review the punitive tariffs - as high as 27 % - that the us has imposed .
in addition , canada continues to pursue challenges through the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which already ruled partially in favour of canada last summer on the issue of export restraints .
also , canada said last month it will spend $ 13 million to explain to americans how bush administration trade policies , including the tariff on softwood lumber , have a negative impact on us consumers .
neighbourly criticism us president george w bush announced the imposition of the lumber tax earlier in march , which were approved by the us international trade commission and took effect last month .
the decision brought harsh criticism from trade-policy experts and threatened the us president 's commitment to free trade , an issue mr bush has loudly touted during his brief presidency .
canada 's pm chretien is seeking resolution given his desire to have congress grant him trade-promotion authority - the ability for the president to make free-trade deals with only an up or down vote by congress - it is a difficult position for mr bush to be in .
but duties on canadian exports of lumber are just one of a number of tariff proposals that have mr bush in hot water with his trading partners .
some accuse him of talking out of both sides of his face - calling for greater , freer trade from one side while announcing trade-stifling tariffs from the other .
mr bush 's call for duties on a wide range of imported steel products in march remains a highly contentious issue among members of the european union and the basis for a possible trade war .
in addition , a recent farm-aid bill signed by the president in may further stirred criticism over us trade policies .
canada reiterated its opposition to the new law last week .
" if you produce in the us at subsidised prices , it makes it uneconomical to convert in developing countries , " canadian finance minister john manley said during the recent meeting of g7 finance ministers in halifax , nova scotia .
eyeing trade mr manley 's comments came at the run-up to the meeting of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialised nations later this month in kananaskis , alberta .
g8 members britain canada france germany italy japan russia united states but even as canada wags its finger in the face of its much larger southern partner , it is still heavily reliant on exports to it .
the united states is canada 's biggest trading partner and vice versa .
trade between the two nations totalled $ 380.7bn in 2001 , with canada accounting for 23 % of american exports and 19 % of imports , according to data from the us department of commerce .
in reporting its latest statistics for international trade , the canadian government noted " the united states accounted for more than two-thirds of the increase in canada 's exports in april " .
it noted export growth was particularly strong in automotive products - canada 's largest export sector - and machinery and equipment .
these two categories account for nearly half of all exports from canada .
poverty plan even as most areas experienced growth , trade in softwood lumber fell to c $ 1.1bn -lrb- $ 717m , £ 479m -rrb- , a 4.8 % decline , according to statistics canada .
adequate supplies of softwood lumber in the us as well as a two-month drop in new-home construction were cited as reasons for the sizable decrease .
but the canadian government also said , " confusion over the outcome of the softwood-lumber dispute in the wake of changing duties and tariffs , " also contributed to the decline .
the confusion is likely to continue .
president bush , canadian prime minister jean chretien and other leaders from the g8 will have their plates full with weightier issues during their two-day meeting - 26-27 june .
among the topics are the global battle against terrorism , strengthening the global economy and a plan to lift africa out of poverty and other topics .
a decades-long dispute over lumber is n't likely to be addressed during the brief confab - even if it is set amid the splendour of a canadian pine forest .

the commons public administration committee is urging the government to include the code in its long-awaited civil service bill .
the aim is to allay concerns that the " public service ethos " is being lost as more services are contracted out to private sector companies .
in a report published on sunday , the committee is also proposing that a public service academy is established to foster the traditional spirit of the public service .
the group 's labour chairman tony wright said : " the right values , the right ethos , are fundamental to any organisation .
" the ethos of public service is special because it matters to all of us , users and providers .
' safeguard ' " our report makes it clear that , at a time of rapid change in public service , we need to do far more to nurture and cultivate the principles that underlie it . "
the report warns the government had failed to develop a " consistent and coherent " policy on the role of private companies in delivering public services .
concerns have been repeatedly raised by workers and unions about the use of the private sector to provide care to nhs patients .
and prime minister tony blair came under pressure in march after it emerged downing street had sent a booklet to managers in the health service , police and education outlining public sector reforms , including a greater role for private companies .
bbc political correspondent reeta chakrabarti says the committee believes that providing a formal definition of what constitutes the spirit of public service would be a good way of letting private managers know what is expected of them .
it would also ensure that private firms did not exploit their position by cutting costs , and would safeguard the interests of the public over and above those of the managers , she says .
