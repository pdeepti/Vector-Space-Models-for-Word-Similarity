"
there 's complete unanimity about the imperative of getting the weapons inspectors back into iraq " jack straw uk foreign secretary us secretary of state colin powell said after a meeting with his counterparts from russia , china , france and the uk that although a un resolution had not yet been written he was " reasonably sure that a resolution must have a deadline to it " .
but despite a day of frantic diplomacy in which mr powell held consultations with all 15 council members and some arab ministers , no member has yet backed the use of force .
to pass a resolution , the us needs a minimum of nine votes and the assurance from the other permanent members that they will not use their veto .
the us has been calling on iraq to comply with existing un resolutions " within weeks " , and discussions will continue later on saturday at the un on possible action .
serious doubts russian foreign minister igor ivanov read out a statement by the five , which said that iraqi leader saddam hussein would have to face the consequences if he refused to co-operate with the security council . "
this resolution , or resolutions have got to be tough , they 've got to be binding " us secretary of state colin powell he said the ministers had begun consultations on how to ensure implementation of the resolutions .
they will continue next week as the us ambassador to the un , john negroponte , meets other council members .
the meetings came after us president george w bush made clear he seriously doubted that saddam would meet us demands and avert a military assault on iraq .
mr powell earlier warned that the un 's credibility was at stake if it continued to allow its resolutions to be ignored .
" this resolution , or resolutions - depending on what the security council agrees upon - have got to be tough , they 've got to be binding , they 've got to have deadlines to them , and there has to be action required as a result of non-compliance , " mr powell said .
uk foreign secretary jack straw said there was a " very clear understanding " that a clear deadline was needed .
" there 's also complete unanimity about the imperative of getting the weapons inspectors back into iraq , " added mr straw .
eleven years mr bush has warned that the us would take unilateral action against baghdad if the un failed to impose its will , arguing that iraq was building weapons of mass destruction .
bush 's demands of iraq relinquish all weapons of mass destruction stop oppressing its people ensure un funds are used for iraqi people and he repeated his call for a un-imposed deadline on the baghdad government to comply with its demands within " days and weeks - not months and years " .
the bbc 's jon leyne says the atmosphere has changed dramatically since mr bush made a commitment to working with the un , thereby defusing any hostility among security council members towards us action .
iraqi deputy prime minister tariq aziz on friday rejected the unconditional return of un arms inspectors as demanded by washington .
course of action : us consults permanent members of the security council resolution is drafted , and tabled , probably , by britain security council debates and eventually approves a resolution deadline is issued to iraq for the return of weapons inspectors if not complied with , then the us will launch final consultations on a military option military preparations gather pace the us central command - which oversees the war in afghanistan - has announced plans to send 600 of its headquarters staff from florida to qatar , near iraq , for a " training " exercise .
and the british army is preparing to move large quantities of weapons , supplies and vehicles from stores around the country to a military port .
