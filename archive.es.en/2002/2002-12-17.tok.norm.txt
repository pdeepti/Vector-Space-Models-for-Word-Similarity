the first may come when germany is welcomed onto the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member from jan .
1 , 2003 .
every two years , five assembly members are invited to join the five permanent countries on the security council .
it will be germany 's fifth turn on the council with the current subject at the top of the agenda being iraq , a theme that must be regularly waking the german chancellor in a cold sweat these days .
as a member of the security council , germany will be called into the front line of decision-making that will dictate what action takes place should iraq fail to adhere to resolution 1441 surrounding its alleged weapons of mass destruction programs .
it could result in the ultimate test of germany 's foreign policy resolve with the united states and britain again pushing for military action and france , russia and china likely to throw spanners in the works once more .
support pre-emptive action or incur america 's wrath ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein .
it could be the chancellor 's hardest choice .
siding with the pre-emptive strike lobby would sit awkwardly with his election declaration that america 's apparent desire for war with saddam hussein would lead to a " reckless adventure . "
a german show of council support for such action would erase the last remnants of credibility the government has on its increasingly shaky anti-involvement policy .
presumably , schröder could claim un obligations as reason enough for his reversal .
sticking to its non-firing guns and opposing a military campaign to disarm the iraqi dictator would set the germans against the americans at a time when recent wounds in the relationship are beginning to slowly heal .
the political effects of a decision which would thwart u.s. plans would last years , even though they would be taken in a united nations context .
conflict between the two nations may also erupt over the international criminal court , which the united states vehemently opposes and the germans unconditionally support , and the current impasse in negotiations between israel and the palestinians .
germany will also have to contend with conflicting interests over the face-offs in kashmir and in various areas of africa .
sanctions committee provides further policy dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil workers in iraq .
another situation where german delegates might face tough decisions that clash with their own foreign policy will be the un 's sanctions committee on iraq .
germany takes over from norway as the head of the body which was set up in 1991 around un resolution 661 , which came into being after the gulf war .
the committee oversees the so-called oil for food program that governs the sale of medical and infrastructure supplies to iraq while restricting any goods that may be used for military purposes .
germany is a supporter of the sanctions against iraq as a way of controlling the development of weapons of mass destruction .
foreign minister joschka fischer has spoken in the past of adapting the current measures on a humanitarian basis rather than tightening the strangle hold the sanctions have on the people of iraq .
this is in direct opposition to the american and british opinion that threats of force and tougher sanctions will bring saddam 's regime into line .
delicate decisions at a time of inner divisions over iraq the german position is a delicate one .
a strong stance at home against military involvement aided the narrow re-election of schröder 's social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , but subsequent arguments within the spd and with coalition partners the green party have made the divisions over iraq embarrassingly public .
taking the arguments onto the international stage could be severely damaging to the administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
however , while chancellor schröder has reneged on many of his election promises , the main aim remains to keep germany out of any direct conflict in iraq .
but in recent weeks , the strong position has wavered with the definite borders of involvement set by the germans becoming increasingly blurred .
awacs and navy deployment may not be ' passive ' allowing the possible use of german air personnel as crews on awacs surveillance aircraft in a nato capacity could be seen as going beyond passive military support .
the united states has requested that 17 aircraft stationed in geilenkirchen , germany , part of 66 strong nato fleet of reconnaissance planes , be used in support of any american action against iraq .
the planes are manned by a multinational crew from 11 countries , nearly one-third of which is german .
in the event of a war against iraq the awacs are likely to be used to monitor turkish airspace .
the chancellor has defended his about-turn with statements of nato allegiance .
" germany will fulfill its obligations towards the alliance ... and that naturally also means protecting alliance territory , " he said on german television last wednesday .
another persuasive call from washington for further possible help came over the weekend when it was suggested that german naval vessels and personnel could be enlisted under their nato obligations to escort u.s. ships into the persian gulf .
defense minister peter struck , visiting german navy sailors on patrol off the horn of africa as part of operation enduring freedom , insisted the deployment of the german navy would not extend beyond its current anti-terrorist activities .

it will be germany 's fifth turn on the council with the current subject at the top of the agenda being iraq , a theme that must be regularly waking the german chancellor in a cold sweat these days .
as a member of the security council , germany will be called into the front line of decision-making that will dictate what action takes place should iraq fail to adhere to resolution 1441 surrounding its alleged weapons of mass destruction programs .
it could result in the ultimate test of germany 's foreign policy resolve with the united states and britain again pushing for military action and france , russia and china likely to throw spanners in the works once more .
support pre-emptive action or incur america 's wrath ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein .
it could be the chancellor 's hardest choice .
siding with the pre-emptive strike lobby would sit awkwardly with his election declaration that america 's apparent desire for war with saddam hussein would lead to a " reckless adventure . "
a german show of council support for such action would erase the last remnants of credibility the government has on its increasingly shaky anti-involvement policy .
presumably , schröder could claim un obligations as reason enough for his reversal .
sticking to its non-firing guns and opposing a military campaign to disarm the iraqi dictator would set the germans against the americans at a time when recent wounds in the relationship are beginning to slowly heal .
the political effects of a decision which would thwart u.s. plans would last years , even though they would be taken in a united nations context .
conflict between the two nations may also erupt over the international criminal court , which the united states vehemently opposes and the germans unconditionally support , and the current impasse in negotiations between israel and the palestinians .
germany will also have to contend with conflicting interests over the face-offs in kashmir and in various areas of africa .
sanctions committee provides further policy dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil workers in iraq .
another situation where german delegates might face tough decisions that clash with their own foreign policy will be the un 's sanctions committee on iraq .
germany takes over from norway as the head of the body which was set up in 1991 around un resolution 661 , which came into being after the gulf war .
the committee oversees the so-called oil for food program that governs the sale of medical and infrastructure supplies to iraq while restricting any goods that may be used for military purposes .
germany is a supporter of the sanctions against iraq as a way of controlling the development of weapons of mass destruction .
foreign minister joschka fischer has spoken in the past of adapting the current measures on a humanitarian basis rather than tightening the strangle hold the sanctions have on the people of iraq .
this is in direct opposition to the american and british opinion that threats of force and tougher sanctions will bring saddam 's regime into line .
delicate decisions at a time of inner divisions over iraq the german position is a delicate one .
a strong stance at home against military involvement aided the narrow re-election of schröder 's social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , but subsequent arguments within the spd and with coalition partners the green party have made the divisions over iraq embarrassingly public .
taking the arguments onto the international stage could be severely damaging to the administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
however , while chancellor schröder has reneged on many of his election promises , the main aim remains to keep germany out of any direct conflict in iraq .
but in recent weeks , the strong position has wavered with the definite borders of involvement set by the germans becoming increasingly blurred .
awacs and navy deployment may not be ' passive ' allowing the possible use of german air personnel as crews on awacs surveillance aircraft in a nato capacity could be seen as going beyond passive military support .
the united states has requested that 17 aircraft stationed in geilenkirchen , germany , part of 66 strong nato fleet of reconnaissance planes , be used in support of any american action against iraq .
the planes are manned by a multinational crew from 11 countries , nearly one-third of which is german .
in the event of a war against iraq the awacs are likely to be used to monitor turkish airspace .
the chancellor has defended his about-turn with statements of nato allegiance .
" germany will fulfill its obligations towards the alliance ... and that naturally also means protecting alliance territory , " he said on german television last wednesday .
another persuasive call from washington for further possible help came over the weekend when it was suggested that german naval vessels and personnel could be enlisted under their nato obligations to escort u.s. ships into the persian gulf .
defense minister peter struck , visiting german navy sailors on patrol off the horn of africa as part of operation enduring freedom , insisted the deployment of the german navy would not extend beyond its current anti-terrorist activities .

the dossier is said to detail covert arms deals between german defense firms and iraq . just as the heated debates within the german government over the role of german troops and equipment in a possible war against iraq seem to be cooling down , another potential bombshell threatens to reignite the fires .
on tuesday , the berlin-based left-wing paper , tageszeitung reported that aspects of the 12,000-page iraqi report on iraq 's weapons programs , submitted to the u.n last week , could prove highly embarrassing for germany .
the newspaper - believed to be the first to have access to the top-secret dossier - has written that the iraqi declaration contains the names of 80 german firms , research laboratories and people , who are said to have helped iraq develop its weapons program .
germany , iraq ’ s number one arms supplier ?
the most contentious piece of news for germany is that the report names it as the number one supplier of weapons supplies to iraq .
german firms are supposed to easily outnumber the firms from other countries who have been exporting to iraq .
they have delivered technical know-how , components , basic substances and even entire technical facilities for the development of atomic , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to iraq right since 1975 .
in some cases , conventional military and technical dealings between germany and iraq are said to date till 2001 , ten years after the second gulf war and a time when international sanctions against saddam hussein are still in place .
the paper reports that the dossier contains several indications of cases , where german authorities right up to the finance ministry tolerated the illegal arms cooperation and also promoted to it to an extent .
wait and watch says german finance ministry the german finance ministry has said that it will react to the report only once it has studied the iraqi declaration .
" we ’ ll first wait till the report is in our hands , " a spokesman from the ministry said on tuesday .
the spokesman however said that the german government of the time in 1990 had informed the parliament about such german supplies to iraq .
ever since iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 , there has been a strict embargo against the country .
the spokesman said that there have been a few cases of violation of the embargo and the government has initiated investigations .
german military exports to iraq nothing new explosive as the newspaper report may appear , it ’ s not the first of its kind .
for months rumors have been circulating in the german media of murky deals between german arms companies and businessmen with iraq despite the rigid embargoes in place .
in october this year , a magazine of the german radio channel , südwestrundfunk reported that electronics giant siemens had delivered specialized technical equipment to iraq for the treatment of kidney stones , but which could also under certain circumstances be used as a detonator for atom bombs .
siemens insisted that the device could not be misused because it had commissioned an iraqi company to regularly monitor the equipment .
in fact the delivery was even sanctioned by the sanctions council of the u.n. and the federal office of economics and export control -lrb- bafa -rrb- .
the latest newspaper report also touches upon the gray zone between medicine and armaments and writes of so-called dual-use goods that can be used for developing weapons as well as for civilian purposes .
the german government was apparently informed in 1999 of the delivery of such dual-use goods to iraq , but is said to have turned a blind eye .
german defense firms conduct roaring trade with baghdad german arms companies in the meantime have been conducting booming business with iraq in recent years .
according to the german federal statistics office , german military exports to iraq have been steadily rising from year to year .
from annual exports amounting to 21,7 million euro in 1997 , the volume of exports for the following year shot to some 76,4 million euro .
the trend continued in 2001 with exports to iraq bringing german firms profits in the range of 336,5 million euro .
german goods worth 226,2 million euro have already been shipped to iraq in the first half of this year .
some of the official heavyweights in the export scene are the german electronics firm siemens with medical equipment and energy distribution systems and carmaker daimlerchrysler .
both are reported to rake in revenues worth double digit figures in the millions .
chancellor schröder in precarious situation though the german government has not officially reacted to the iraqi declaration detailing its role in supplying iraq with arms , there is little doubt that the issue is bound to stoke passions .
ever since chancellor gerhard schröder refused to be part of any military action in iraq before the german general elections in september , berlin ’ s relation to washington has been a strained one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder with schröder sticking to his pacifist line , but dithering over the level of cooperation with the u.s. in the case of a war against iraq , the latest report is guaranteed to provide ammunition to the opposition who have strongly criticized schröder ’ s policy towards america .
another real fear is that schröder ’ s image as a staunch pacifist might now be sullied if it emerges that germany has all along been helping the very leader who it has been unwilling to topple , to stockpile his weapons .
the report could also provide the u.s. with an excuse to step up the pressure on germany to give in to american military demands for deployment of german troops and use of german military equipment in the case of a military attack on iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?

the eu will have access to a nato planning base in belgium , and will be able to use nato logistics and information resources . robertson called the new partnership “ a milestone in the history of relations between the nato and the eu . ” although closer cooperation has been in the works for a few years now , the move was only made possible by the change in turkey ’ s stance on the issue .
until last week , turkey – which belongs to nato but not to the eu – had blocked closer cooperation between the two organizations .
it feared its own security interests would be compromised vis-à-vis the island of cyprus which it co-governs with greece . turkey was forced to change its stance on the issue at last week ’ s eu enlargement summit in copenhagen .
there , france and germany heaped pressure on turkish prime minister abdullah gul to get turkey to stop blocking the berlin plus agreement . the pressure was set against the other conference decision on turkey : the eu will begin an assessment of turkey ’ s stance on human rights , democracy and its economy in october 2004 , with possible eu accession talks starting soon afterwards . giving credibility to pan-eu defence and security the european union decided to create its own military arm at the helsinki summit three years ago , when it launched plans for a european security and defence policy .
the move was seen as a natural step for the eu at a time when its influence in both political and economic realms continues to grow . the stated aim is a 60,000-strong european rapid reaction force intended for peace-keeping and humanitarian missions , which can be ready for deployment within 60 days and could remain in place for up to one year .
with nato ’ s cooperation , this will be up and running by 2003 . the first eu troops – who will wear their national uniforms with an added eu insignia – could be deployed within the next few weeks as the new eu forces take over operation " amber fox " in the balkan republic of macedonia .
and on january 1 , more than 500 eu troops will also take over a un peace-keeping mission in bosnia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european security and defense policy germany extends commitment in macedonia www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

the eu will have access to a nato planning base in belgium , and will be able to use nato logistics and information resources . robertson called the new partnership “ a milestone in the history of relations between the nato and the eu . ” although closer cooperation has been in the works for a few years now , the move was only made possible by the change in turkey ’ s stance on the issue .
until last week , turkey – which belongs to nato but not to the eu – had blocked closer cooperation between the two organizations .
it feared its own security interests would be compromised vis-à-vis the island of cyprus which it co-governs with greece . turkey was forced to change its stance on the issue at last week ’ s eu enlargement summit in copenhagen .
there , france and germany heaped pressure on turkish prime minister abdullah gul to get turkey to stop blocking the berlin plus agreement . the pressure was set against the other conference decision on turkey : the eu will begin an assessment of turkey ’ s stance on human rights , democracy and its economy in october 2004 , with possible eu accession talks starting soon afterwards . giving credibility to pan-eu defence and security the european union decided to create its own military arm at the helsinki summit three years ago , when it launched plans for a european security and defence policy .
the move was seen as a natural step for the eu at a time when its influence in both political and economic realms continues to grow . the stated aim is a 60,000-strong european rapid reaction force intended for peace-keeping and humanitarian missions , which can be ready for deployment within 60 days and could remain in place for up to one year .
with nato ’ s cooperation , this will be up and running by 2003 . the first eu troops – who will wear their national uniforms with an added eu insignia – could be deployed within the next few weeks as the new eu forces take over operation " amber fox " in the balkan republic of macedonia .

the dossier is said to detail covert arms deals between german defense firms and iraq . just as the heated debates within the german government over the role of german troops and equipment in a possible war against iraq seem to be cooling down , another potential bombshell threatens to reignite the fires .
on tuesday , the berlin-based left-wing paper , tageszeitung reported that aspects of the 12,000-page iraqi report on iraq 's weapons programs , submitted to the u.n last week , could prove highly embarrassing for germany .
the newspaper - believed to be the first to have access to the top-secret dossier - has written that the iraqi declaration contains the names of 80 german firms , research laboratories and people , who are said to have helped iraq develop its weapons program .
germany , iraq ’ s number one arms supplier ?
the most contentious piece of news for germany is that the report names it as the number one supplier of weapons supplies to iraq .
german firms are supposed to easily outnumber the firms from other countries who have been exporting to iraq .
they have delivered technical know-how , components , basic substances and even entire technical facilities for the development of atomic , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to iraq right since 1975 .
in some cases , conventional military and technical dealings between germany and iraq are said to date till 2001 , ten years after the second gulf war and a time when international sanctions against saddam hussein are still in place .
the paper reports that the dossier contains several indications of cases , where german authorities right up to the finance ministry tolerated the illegal arms cooperation and also promoted to it to an extent .
wait and watch says german finance ministry the german finance ministry has said that it will react to the report only once it has studied the iraqi declaration .
" we ’ ll first wait till the report is in our hands , " a spokesman from the ministry said on tuesday .
the spokesman however said that the german government of the time in 1990 had informed the parliament about such german supplies to iraq .
ever since iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 , there has been a strict embargo against the country .
the spokesman said that there have been a few cases of violation of the embargo and the government has initiated investigations .
german military exports to iraq nothing new explosive as the newspaper report may appear , it ’ s not the first of its kind .
for months rumors have been circulating in the german media of murky deals between german arms companies and businessmen with iraq despite the rigid embargoes in place .
in october this year , a magazine of the german radio channel , südwestrundfunk reported that electronics giant siemens had delivered specialized technical equipment to iraq for the treatment of kidney stones , but which could also under certain circumstances be used as a detonator for atom bombs .
siemens insisted that the device could not be misused because it had commissioned an iraqi company to regularly monitor the equipment .
in fact the delivery was even sanctioned by the sanctions council of the u.n. and the federal office of economics and export control -lrb- bafa -rrb- .
the latest newspaper report also touches upon the gray zone between medicine and armaments and writes of so-called dual-use goods that can be used for developing weapons as well as for civilian purposes .
the german government was apparently informed in 1999 of the delivery of such dual-use goods to iraq , but is said to have turned a blind eye .
german defense firms conduct roaring trade with baghdad german arms companies in the meantime have been conducting booming business with iraq in recent years .
according to the german federal statistics office , german military exports to iraq have been steadily rising from year to year .
from annual exports amounting to 21,7 million euro in 1997 , the volume of exports for the following year shot to some 76,4 million euro .
the trend continued in 2001 with exports to iraq bringing german firms profits in the range of 336,5 million euro .
german goods worth 226,2 million euro have already been shipped to iraq in the first half of this year .
some of the official heavyweights in the export scene are the german electronics firm siemens with medical equipment and energy distribution systems and carmaker daimlerchrysler .
both are reported to rake in revenues worth double digit figures in the millions .
chancellor schröder in precarious situation though the german government has not officially reacted to the iraqi declaration detailing its role in supplying iraq with arms , there is little doubt that the issue is bound to stoke passions .
ever since chancellor gerhard schröder refused to be part of any military action in iraq before the german general elections in september , berlin ’ s relation to washington has been a strained one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder with schröder sticking to his pacifist line , but dithering over the level of cooperation with the u.s. in the case of a war against iraq , the latest report is guaranteed to provide ammunition to the opposition who have strongly criticized schröder ’ s policy towards america .
another real fear is that schröder ’ s image as a staunch pacifist might now be sullied if it emerges that germany has all along been helping the very leader who it has been unwilling to topple , to stockpile his weapons .
the report could also provide the u.s. with an excuse to step up the pressure on germany to give in to american military demands for deployment of german troops and use of german military equipment in the case of a military attack on iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
germany will join the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member next year and head the sanctions committee on iraq , a position that could place it at odds with its own stated foreign policy .

the first may come when germany is welcomed onto the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member from jan .
1 , 2003 .
every two years , five assembly members are invited to join the five permanent countries on the security council .
it will be germany 's fifth turn on the council with the current subject at the top of the agenda being iraq , a theme that must be regularly waking the german chancellor in a cold sweat these days .
as a member of the security council , germany will be called into the front line of decision-making that will dictate what action takes place should iraq fail to adhere to resolution 1441 surrounding its alleged weapons of mass destruction programs .
it could result in the ultimate test of germany 's foreign policy resolve with the united states and britain again pushing for military action and france , russia and china likely to throw spanners in the works once more .
support pre-emptive action or incur america 's wrath ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein .
it could be the chancellor 's hardest choice .
siding with the pre-emptive strike lobby would sit awkwardly with his election declaration that america 's apparent desire for war with saddam hussein would lead to a " reckless adventure . "
a german show of council support for such action would erase the last remnants of credibility the government has on its increasingly shaky anti-involvement policy .
presumably , schröder could claim un obligations as reason enough for his reversal .
sticking to its non-firing guns and opposing a military campaign to disarm the iraqi dictator would set the germans against the americans at a time when recent wounds in the relationship are beginning to slowly heal .
the political effects of a decision which would thwart u.s. plans would last years , even though they would be taken in a united nations context .
conflict between the two nations may also erupt over the international criminal court , which the united states vehemently opposes and the germans unconditionally support , and the current impasse in negotiations between israel and the palestinians .
germany will also have to contend with conflicting interests over the face-offs in kashmir and in various areas of africa .
sanctions committee provides further policy dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil workers in iraq .
another situation where german delegates might face tough decisions that clash with their own foreign policy will be the un 's sanctions committee on iraq .
germany takes over from norway as the head of the body which was set up in 1991 around un resolution 661 , which came into being after the gulf war .
the committee oversees the so-called oil for food program that governs the sale of medical and infrastructure supplies to iraq while restricting any goods that may be used for military purposes .
germany is a supporter of the sanctions against iraq as a way of controlling the development of weapons of mass destruction .
foreign minister joschka fischer has spoken in the past of adapting the current measures on a humanitarian basis rather than tightening the strangle hold the sanctions have on the people of iraq .

the dossier is said to detail covert arms deals between german defense firms and iraq . just as the heated debates within the german government over the role of german troops and equipment in a possible war against iraq seem to be cooling down , another potential bombshell threatens to reignite the fires .
on tuesday , the berlin-based left-wing paper , tageszeitung reported that aspects of the 12,000-page iraqi report on iraq 's weapons programs , submitted to the u.n last week , could prove highly embarrassing for germany .
the newspaper - believed to be the first to have access to the top-secret dossier - has written that the iraqi declaration contains the names of 80 german firms , research laboratories and people , who are said to have helped iraq develop its weapons program .
germany , iraq ’ s number one arms supplier ?
the most contentious piece of news for germany is that the report names it as the number one supplier of weapons supplies to iraq .
german firms are supposed to easily outnumber the firms from other countries who have been exporting to iraq .
they have delivered technical know-how , components , basic substances and even entire technical facilities for the development of atomic , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to iraq right since 1975 .
in some cases , conventional military and technical dealings between germany and iraq are said to date till 2001 , ten years after the second gulf war and a time when international sanctions against saddam hussein are still in place .
the paper reports that the dossier contains several indications of cases , where german authorities right up to the finance ministry tolerated the illegal arms cooperation and also promoted to it to an extent .
wait and watch says german finance ministry the german finance ministry has said that it will react to the report only once it has studied the iraqi declaration .
" we ’ ll first wait till the report is in our hands , " a spokesman from the ministry said on tuesday .
the spokesman however said that the german government of the time in 1990 had informed the parliament about such german supplies to iraq .
ever since iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 , there has been a strict embargo against the country .
the spokesman said that there have been a few cases of violation of the embargo and the government has initiated investigations .
german military exports to iraq nothing new explosive as the newspaper report may appear , it ’ s not the first of its kind .
for months rumors have been circulating in the german media of murky deals between german arms companies and businessmen with iraq despite the rigid embargoes in place .
in october this year , a magazine of the german radio channel , südwestrundfunk reported that electronics giant siemens had delivered specialized technical equipment to iraq for the treatment of kidney stones , but which could also under certain circumstances be used as a detonator for atom bombs .
siemens insisted that the device could not be misused because it had commissioned an iraqi company to regularly monitor the equipment .
in fact the delivery was even sanctioned by the sanctions council of the u.n. and the federal office of economics and export control -lrb- bafa -rrb- .
the latest newspaper report also touches upon the gray zone between medicine and armaments and writes of so-called dual-use goods that can be used for developing weapons as well as for civilian purposes .
the german government was apparently informed in 1999 of the delivery of such dual-use goods to iraq , but is said to have turned a blind eye .
german defense firms conduct roaring trade with baghdad german arms companies in the meantime have been conducting booming business with iraq in recent years .
according to the german federal statistics office , german military exports to iraq have been steadily rising from year to year .
from annual exports amounting to 21,7 million euro in 1997 , the volume of exports for the following year shot to some 76,4 million euro .
the trend continued in 2001 with exports to iraq bringing german firms profits in the range of 336,5 million euro .
german goods worth 226,2 million euro have already been shipped to iraq in the first half of this year .
some of the official heavyweights in the export scene are the german electronics firm siemens with medical equipment and energy distribution systems and carmaker daimlerchrysler .
both are reported to rake in revenues worth double digit figures in the millions .
chancellor schröder in precarious situation though the german government has not officially reacted to the iraqi declaration detailing its role in supplying iraq with arms , there is little doubt that the issue is bound to stoke passions .
ever since chancellor gerhard schröder refused to be part of any military action in iraq before the german general elections in september , berlin ’ s relation to washington has been a strained one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder with schröder sticking to his pacifist line , but dithering over the level of cooperation with the u.s. in the case of a war against iraq , the latest report is guaranteed to provide ammunition to the opposition who have strongly criticized schröder ’ s policy towards america .
another real fear is that schröder ’ s image as a staunch pacifist might now be sullied if it emerges that germany has all along been helping the very leader who it has been unwilling to topple , to stockpile his weapons .
the report could also provide the u.s. with an excuse to step up the pressure on germany to give in to american military demands for deployment of german troops and use of german military equipment in the case of a military attack on iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
germany will join the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member next year and head the sanctions committee on iraq , a position that could place it at odds with its own stated foreign policy .

the first may come when germany is welcomed onto the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member from jan .
1 , 2003 .
every two years , five assembly members are invited to join the five permanent countries on the security council .
it will be germany 's fifth turn on the council with the current subject at the top of the agenda being iraq , a theme that must be regularly waking the german chancellor in a cold sweat these days .
as a member of the security council , germany will be called into the front line of decision-making that will dictate what action takes place should iraq fail to adhere to resolution 1441 surrounding its alleged weapons of mass destruction programs .
it could result in the ultimate test of germany 's foreign policy resolve with the united states and britain again pushing for military action and france , russia and china likely to throw spanners in the works once more .
support pre-emptive action or incur america 's wrath ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein .
it could be the chancellor 's hardest choice .
siding with the pre-emptive strike lobby would sit awkwardly with his election declaration that america 's apparent desire for war with saddam hussein would lead to a " reckless adventure . "
a german show of council support for such action would erase the last remnants of credibility the government has on its increasingly shaky anti-involvement policy .
presumably , schröder could claim un obligations as reason enough for his reversal .
sticking to its non-firing guns and opposing a military campaign to disarm the iraqi dictator would set the germans against the americans at a time when recent wounds in the relationship are beginning to slowly heal .
the political effects of a decision which would thwart u.s. plans would last years , even though they would be taken in a united nations context .
conflict between the two nations may also erupt over the international criminal court , which the united states vehemently opposes and the germans unconditionally support , and the current impasse in negotiations between israel and the palestinians .
germany will also have to contend with conflicting interests over the face-offs in kashmir and in various areas of africa .
sanctions committee provides further policy dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil workers in iraq .
another situation where german delegates might face tough decisions that clash with their own foreign policy will be the un 's sanctions committee on iraq .
germany takes over from norway as the head of the body which was set up in 1991 around un resolution 661 , which came into being after the gulf war .
the committee oversees the so-called oil for food program that governs the sale of medical and infrastructure supplies to iraq while restricting any goods that may be used for military purposes .
germany is a supporter of the sanctions against iraq as a way of controlling the development of weapons of mass destruction .
foreign minister joschka fischer has spoken in the past of adapting the current measures on a humanitarian basis rather than tightening the strangle hold the sanctions have on the people of iraq .
this is in direct opposition to the american and british opinion that threats of force and tougher sanctions will bring saddam 's regime into line .
delicate decisions at a time of inner divisions over iraq the german position is a delicate one .
a strong stance at home against military involvement aided the narrow re-election of schröder 's social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , but subsequent arguments within the spd and with coalition partners the green party have made the divisions over iraq embarrassingly public .
taking the arguments onto the international stage could be severely damaging to the administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
however , while chancellor schröder has reneged on many of his election promises , the main aim remains to keep germany out of any direct conflict in iraq .

the dossier is said to detail covert arms deals between german defense firms and iraq . just as the heated debates within the german government over the role of german troops and equipment in a possible war against iraq seem to be cooling down , another potential bombshell threatens to reignite the fires .
on tuesday , the berlin-based left-wing paper , tageszeitung reported that aspects of the 12,000-page iraqi report on iraq 's weapons programs , submitted to the u.n last week , could prove highly embarrassing for germany .
the newspaper - believed to be the first to have access to the top-secret dossier - has written that the iraqi declaration contains the names of 80 german firms , research laboratories and people , who are said to have helped iraq develop its weapons program .
germany , iraq ’ s number one arms supplier ?
the most contentious piece of news for germany is that the report names it as the number one supplier of weapons supplies to iraq .
german firms are supposed to easily outnumber the firms from other countries who have been exporting to iraq .
they have delivered technical know-how , components , basic substances and even entire technical facilities for the development of atomic , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to iraq right since 1975 .
in some cases , conventional military and technical dealings between germany and iraq are said to date till 2001 , ten years after the second gulf war and a time when international sanctions against saddam hussein are still in place .
the paper reports that the dossier contains several indications of cases , where german authorities right up to the finance ministry tolerated the illegal arms cooperation and also promoted to it to an extent .
wait and watch says german finance ministry the german finance ministry has said that it will react to the report only once it has studied the iraqi declaration .
" we ’ ll first wait till the report is in our hands , " a spokesman from the ministry said on tuesday .
the spokesman however said that the german government of the time in 1990 had informed the parliament about such german supplies to iraq .
ever since iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 , there has been a strict embargo against the country .
the spokesman said that there have been a few cases of violation of the embargo and the government has initiated investigations .
german military exports to iraq nothing new explosive as the newspaper report may appear , it ’ s not the first of its kind .
for months rumors have been circulating in the german media of murky deals between german arms companies and businessmen with iraq despite the rigid embargoes in place .
in october this year , a magazine of the german radio channel , südwestrundfunk reported that electronics giant siemens had delivered specialized technical equipment to iraq for the treatment of kidney stones , but which could also under certain circumstances be used as a detonator for atom bombs .
siemens insisted that the device could not be misused because it had commissioned an iraqi company to regularly monitor the equipment .
in fact the delivery was even sanctioned by the sanctions council of the u.n. and the federal office of economics and export control -lrb- bafa -rrb- .
the latest newspaper report also touches upon the gray zone between medicine and armaments and writes of so-called dual-use goods that can be used for developing weapons as well as for civilian purposes .
the german government was apparently informed in 1999 of the delivery of such dual-use goods to iraq , but is said to have turned a blind eye .
german defense firms conduct roaring trade with baghdad german arms companies in the meantime have been conducting booming business with iraq in recent years .
according to the german federal statistics office , german military exports to iraq have been steadily rising from year to year .
from annual exports amounting to 21,7 million euro in 1997 , the volume of exports for the following year shot to some 76,4 million euro .
the trend continued in 2001 with exports to iraq bringing german firms profits in the range of 336,5 million euro .
german goods worth 226,2 million euro have already been shipped to iraq in the first half of this year .
some of the official heavyweights in the export scene are the german electronics firm siemens with medical equipment and energy distribution systems and carmaker daimlerchrysler .
both are reported to rake in revenues worth double digit figures in the millions .
chancellor schröder in precarious situation though the german government has not officially reacted to the iraqi declaration detailing its role in supplying iraq with arms , there is little doubt that the issue is bound to stoke passions .
ever since chancellor gerhard schröder refused to be part of any military action in iraq before the german general elections in september , berlin ’ s relation to washington has been a strained one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder with schröder sticking to his pacifist line , but dithering over the level of cooperation with the u.s. in the case of a war against iraq , the latest report is guaranteed to provide ammunition to the opposition who have strongly criticized schröder ’ s policy towards america .
another real fear is that schröder ’ s image as a staunch pacifist might now be sullied if it emerges that germany has all along been helping the very leader who it has been unwilling to topple , to stockpile his weapons .
the report could also provide the u.s. with an excuse to step up the pressure on germany to give in to american military demands for deployment of german troops and use of german military equipment in the case of a military attack on iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
germany will join the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member next year and head the sanctions committee on iraq , a position that could place it at odds with its own stated foreign policy .

from annual exports amounting to 21,7 million euro in 1997 , the volume of exports for the following year shot to some 76,4 million euro .
the trend continued in 2001 with exports to iraq bringing german firms profits in the range of 336,5 million euro .
german goods worth 226,2 million euro have already been shipped to iraq in the first half of this year .
some of the official heavyweights in the export scene are the german electronics firm siemens with medical equipment and energy distribution systems and carmaker daimlerchrysler .
both are reported to rake in revenues worth double digit figures in the millions .
chancellor schröder in precarious situation though the german government has not officially reacted to the iraqi declaration detailing its role in supplying iraq with arms , there is little doubt that the issue is bound to stoke passions .
ever since chancellor gerhard schröder refused to be part of any military action in iraq before the german general elections in september , berlin ’ s relation to washington has been a strained one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder with schröder sticking to his pacifist line , but dithering over the level of cooperation with the u.s. in the case of a war against iraq , the latest report is guaranteed to provide ammunition to the opposition who have strongly criticized schröder ’ s policy towards america .
another real fear is that schröder ’ s image as a staunch pacifist might now be sullied if it emerges that germany has all along been helping the very leader who it has been unwilling to topple , to stockpile his weapons .
the report could also provide the u.s. with an excuse to step up the pressure on germany to give in to american military demands for deployment of german troops and use of german military equipment in the case of a military attack on iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
germany will join the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member next year and head the sanctions committee on iraq , a position that could place it at odds with its own stated foreign policy .

the first may come when germany is welcomed onto the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member from jan .
1 , 2003 .
every two years , five assembly members are invited to join the five permanent countries on the security council .
it will be germany 's fifth turn on the council with the current subject at the top of the agenda being iraq , a theme that must be regularly waking the german chancellor in a cold sweat these days .
as a member of the security council , germany will be called into the front line of decision-making that will dictate what action takes place should iraq fail to adhere to resolution 1441 surrounding its alleged weapons of mass destruction programs .
it could result in the ultimate test of germany 's foreign policy resolve with the united states and britain again pushing for military action and france , russia and china likely to throw spanners in the works once more .
support pre-emptive action or incur america 's wrath ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein .
it could be the chancellor 's hardest choice .
siding with the pre-emptive strike lobby would sit awkwardly with his election declaration that america 's apparent desire for war with saddam hussein would lead to a " reckless adventure . "
a german show of council support for such action would erase the last remnants of credibility the government has on its increasingly shaky anti-involvement policy .
presumably , schröder could claim un obligations as reason enough for his reversal .
sticking to its non-firing guns and opposing a military campaign to disarm the iraqi dictator would set the germans against the americans at a time when recent wounds in the relationship are beginning to slowly heal .
the political effects of a decision which would thwart u.s. plans would last years , even though they would be taken in a united nations context .
conflict between the two nations may also erupt over the international criminal court , which the united states vehemently opposes and the germans unconditionally support , and the current impasse in negotiations between israel and the palestinians .
germany will also have to contend with conflicting interests over the face-offs in kashmir and in various areas of africa .
sanctions committee provides further policy dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil workers in iraq .
another situation where german delegates might face tough decisions that clash with their own foreign policy will be the un 's sanctions committee on iraq .
germany takes over from norway as the head of the body which was set up in 1991 around un resolution 661 , which came into being after the gulf war .
the committee oversees the so-called oil for food program that governs the sale of medical and infrastructure supplies to iraq while restricting any goods that may be used for military purposes .
germany is a supporter of the sanctions against iraq as a way of controlling the development of weapons of mass destruction .
foreign minister joschka fischer has spoken in the past of adapting the current measures on a humanitarian basis rather than tightening the strangle hold the sanctions have on the people of iraq .
this is in direct opposition to the american and british opinion that threats of force and tougher sanctions will bring saddam 's regime into line .
delicate decisions at a time of inner divisions over iraq the german position is a delicate one .
a strong stance at home against military involvement aided the narrow re-election of schröder 's social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , but subsequent arguments within the spd and with coalition partners the green party have made the divisions over iraq embarrassingly public .
taking the arguments onto the international stage could be severely damaging to the administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
however , while chancellor schröder has reneged on many of his election promises , the main aim remains to keep germany out of any direct conflict in iraq .
but in recent weeks , the strong position has wavered with the definite borders of involvement set by the germans becoming increasingly blurred .

the dossier is said to detail covert arms deals between german defense firms and iraq . just as the heated debates within the german government over the role of german troops and equipment in a possible war against iraq seem to be cooling down , another potential bombshell threatens to reignite the fires .
on tuesday , the berlin-based left-wing paper , tageszeitung reported that aspects of the 12,000-page iraqi report on iraq 's weapons programs , submitted to the u.n last week , could prove highly embarrassing for germany .
the newspaper - believed to be the first to have access to the top-secret dossier - has written that the iraqi declaration contains the names of 80 german firms , research laboratories and people , who are said to have helped iraq develop its weapons program .
germany , iraq ’ s number one arms supplier ?
the most contentious piece of news for germany is that the report names it as the number one supplier of weapons supplies to iraq .
german firms are supposed to easily outnumber the firms from other countries who have been exporting to iraq .
they have delivered technical know-how , components , basic substances and even entire technical facilities for the development of atomic , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to iraq right since 1975 .
in some cases , conventional military and technical dealings between germany and iraq are said to date till 2001 , ten years after the second gulf war and a time when international sanctions against saddam hussein are still in place .
the paper reports that the dossier contains several indications of cases , where german authorities right up to the finance ministry tolerated the illegal arms cooperation and also promoted to it to an extent .
wait and watch says german finance ministry the german finance ministry has said that it will react to the report only once it has studied the iraqi declaration .
" we ’ ll first wait till the report is in our hands , " a spokesman from the ministry said on tuesday .
the spokesman however said that the german government of the time in 1990 had informed the parliament about such german supplies to iraq .
ever since iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 , there has been a strict embargo against the country .
the spokesman said that there have been a few cases of violation of the embargo and the government has initiated investigations .
german military exports to iraq nothing new explosive as the newspaper report may appear , it ’ s not the first of its kind .
for months rumors have been circulating in the german media of murky deals between german arms companies and businessmen with iraq despite the rigid embargoes in place .
in october this year , a magazine of the german radio channel , südwestrundfunk reported that electronics giant siemens had delivered specialized technical equipment to iraq for the treatment of kidney stones , but which could also under certain circumstances be used as a detonator for atom bombs .
siemens insisted that the device could not be misused because it had commissioned an iraqi company to regularly monitor the equipment .
in fact the delivery was even sanctioned by the sanctions council of the u.n. and the federal office of economics and export control -lrb- bafa -rrb- .
the latest newspaper report also touches upon the gray zone between medicine and armaments and writes of so-called dual-use goods that can be used for developing weapons as well as for civilian purposes .
the german government was apparently informed in 1999 of the delivery of such dual-use goods to iraq , but is said to have turned a blind eye .
german defense firms conduct roaring trade with baghdad german arms companies in the meantime have been conducting booming business with iraq in recent years .
according to the german federal statistics office , german military exports to iraq have been steadily rising from year to year .
from annual exports amounting to 21,7 million euro in 1997 , the volume of exports for the following year shot to some 76,4 million euro .
the trend continued in 2001 with exports to iraq bringing german firms profits in the range of 336,5 million euro .
german goods worth 226,2 million euro have already been shipped to iraq in the first half of this year .
some of the official heavyweights in the export scene are the german electronics firm siemens with medical equipment and energy distribution systems and carmaker daimlerchrysler .
both are reported to rake in revenues worth double digit figures in the millions .
chancellor schröder in precarious situation though the german government has not officially reacted to the iraqi declaration detailing its role in supplying iraq with arms , there is little doubt that the issue is bound to stoke passions .
ever since chancellor gerhard schröder refused to be part of any military action in iraq before the german general elections in september , berlin ’ s relation to washington has been a strained one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder with schröder sticking to his pacifist line , but dithering over the level of cooperation with the u.s. in the case of a war against iraq , the latest report is guaranteed to provide ammunition to the opposition who have strongly criticized schröder ’ s policy towards america .
another real fear is that schröder ’ s image as a staunch pacifist might now be sullied if it emerges that germany has all along been helping the very leader who it has been unwilling to topple , to stockpile his weapons .
the report could also provide the u.s. with an excuse to step up the pressure on germany to give in to american military demands for deployment of german troops and use of german military equipment in the case of a military attack on iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?

the eu will have access to a nato planning base in belgium , and will be able to use nato logistics and information resources . robertson called the new partnership “ a milestone in the history of relations between the nato and the eu . ” although closer cooperation has been in the works for a few years now , the move was only made possible by the change in turkey ’ s stance on the issue .
until last week , turkey – which belongs to nato but not to the eu – had blocked closer cooperation between the two organizations .
it feared its own security interests would be compromised vis-à-vis the island of cyprus which it co-governs with greece . turkey was forced to change its stance on the issue at last week ’ s eu enlargement summit in copenhagen .
there , france and germany heaped pressure on turkish prime minister abdullah gul to get turkey to stop blocking the berlin plus agreement . the pressure was set against the other conference decision on turkey : the eu will begin an assessment of turkey ’ s stance on human rights , democracy and its economy in october 2004 , with possible eu accession talks starting soon afterwards . giving credibility to pan-eu defence and security the european union decided to create its own military arm at the helsinki summit three years ago , when it launched plans for a european security and defence policy .
the move was seen as a natural step for the eu at a time when its influence in both political and economic realms continues to grow . the stated aim is a 60,000-strong european rapid reaction force intended for peace-keeping and humanitarian missions , which can be ready for deployment within 60 days and could remain in place for up to one year .
with nato ’ s cooperation , this will be up and running by 2003 . the first eu troops – who will wear their national uniforms with an added eu insignia – could be deployed within the next few weeks as the new eu forces take over operation " amber fox " in the balkan republic of macedonia .
and on january 1 , more than 500 eu troops will also take over a un peace-keeping mission in bosnia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european security and defense policy germany extends commitment in macedonia www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

every two years , five assembly members are invited to join the five permanent countries on the security council .
it will be germany 's fifth turn on the council with the current subject at the top of the agenda being iraq , a theme that must be regularly waking the german chancellor in a cold sweat these days .
as a member of the security council , germany will be called into the front line of decision-making that will dictate what action takes place should iraq fail to adhere to resolution 1441 surrounding its alleged weapons of mass destruction programs .
it could result in the ultimate test of germany 's foreign policy resolve with the united states and britain again pushing for military action and france , russia and china likely to throw spanners in the works once more .
support pre-emptive action or incur america 's wrath ?

it could be the chancellor 's hardest choice .
siding with the pre-emptive strike lobby would sit awkwardly with his election declaration that america 's apparent desire for war with saddam hussein would lead to a " reckless adventure . "
a german show of council support for such action would erase the last remnants of credibility the government has on its increasingly shaky anti-involvement policy .
presumably , schröder could claim un obligations as reason enough for his reversal .
sticking to its non-firing guns and opposing a military campaign to disarm the iraqi dictator would set the germans against the americans at a time when recent wounds in the relationship are beginning to slowly heal .
the political effects of a decision which would thwart u.s. plans would last years , even though they would be taken in a united nations context .
conflict between the two nations may also erupt over the international criminal court , which the united states vehemently opposes and the germans unconditionally support , and the current impasse in negotiations between israel and the palestinians .
germany will also have to contend with conflicting interests over the face-offs in kashmir and in various areas of africa .
sanctions committee provides further policy dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil workers in iraq .
another situation where german delegates might face tough decisions that clash with their own foreign policy will be the un 's sanctions committee on iraq .
germany takes over from norway as the head of the body which was set up in 1991 around un resolution 661 , which came into being after the gulf war .
the committee oversees the so-called oil for food program that governs the sale of medical and infrastructure supplies to iraq while restricting any goods that may be used for military purposes .
germany is a supporter of the sanctions against iraq as a way of controlling the development of weapons of mass destruction .
foreign minister joschka fischer has spoken in the past of adapting the current measures on a humanitarian basis rather than tightening the strangle hold the sanctions have on the people of iraq .
this is in direct opposition to the american and british opinion that threats of force and tougher sanctions will bring saddam 's regime into line .
delicate decisions at a time of inner divisions over iraq the german position is a delicate one .
a strong stance at home against military involvement aided the narrow re-election of schröder 's social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , but subsequent arguments within the spd and with coalition partners the green party have made the divisions over iraq embarrassingly public .

however , while chancellor schröder has reneged on many of his election promises , the main aim remains to keep germany out of any direct conflict in iraq .
but in recent weeks , the strong position has wavered with the definite borders of involvement set by the germans becoming increasingly blurred .
awacs and navy deployment may not be ' passive ' allowing the possible use of german air personnel as crews on awacs surveillance aircraft in a nato capacity could be seen as going beyond passive military support .
the united states has requested that 17 aircraft stationed in geilenkirchen , germany , part of 66 strong nato fleet of reconnaissance planes , be used in support of any american action against iraq .
the planes are manned by a multinational crew from 11 countries , nearly one-third of which is german .
in the event of a war against iraq the awacs are likely to be used to monitor turkish airspace .

the eu will have access to a nato planning base in belgium , and will be able to use nato logistics and information resources . robertson called the new partnership “ a milestone in the history of relations between the nato and the eu . ” although closer cooperation has been in the works for a few years now , the move was only made possible by the change in turkey ’ s stance on the issue .
until last week , turkey – which belongs to nato but not to the eu – had blocked closer cooperation between the two organizations .
it feared its own security interests would be compromised vis-à-vis the island of cyprus which it co-governs with greece . turkey was forced to change its stance on the issue at last week ’ s eu enlargement summit in copenhagen .

the first may come when germany is welcomed onto the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member from jan .
1 , 2003 .
every two years , five assembly members are invited to join the five permanent countries on the security council .
it will be germany 's fifth turn on the council with the current subject at the top of the agenda being iraq , a theme that must be regularly waking the german chancellor in a cold sweat these days .
as a member of the security council , germany will be called into the front line of decision-making that will dictate what action takes place should iraq fail to adhere to resolution 1441 surrounding its alleged weapons of mass destruction programs .
it could result in the ultimate test of germany 's foreign policy resolve with the united states and britain again pushing for military action and france , russia and china likely to throw spanners in the works once more .
support pre-emptive action or incur america 's wrath ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein .
it could be the chancellor 's hardest choice .
siding with the pre-emptive strike lobby would sit awkwardly with his election declaration that america 's apparent desire for war with saddam hussein would lead to a " reckless adventure . "
a german show of council support for such action would erase the last remnants of credibility the government has on its increasingly shaky anti-involvement policy .
presumably , schröder could claim un obligations as reason enough for his reversal .
sticking to its non-firing guns and opposing a military campaign to disarm the iraqi dictator would set the germans against the americans at a time when recent wounds in the relationship are beginning to slowly heal .
the political effects of a decision which would thwart u.s. plans would last years , even though they would be taken in a united nations context .
conflict between the two nations may also erupt over the international criminal court , which the united states vehemently opposes and the germans unconditionally support , and the current impasse in negotiations between israel and the palestinians .
germany will also have to contend with conflicting interests over the face-offs in kashmir and in various areas of africa .
sanctions committee provides further policy dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil workers in iraq .
another situation where german delegates might face tough decisions that clash with their own foreign policy will be the un 's sanctions committee on iraq .
germany takes over from norway as the head of the body which was set up in 1991 around un resolution 661 , which came into being after the gulf war .
the committee oversees the so-called oil for food program that governs the sale of medical and infrastructure supplies to iraq while restricting any goods that may be used for military purposes .
germany is a supporter of the sanctions against iraq as a way of controlling the development of weapons of mass destruction .
foreign minister joschka fischer has spoken in the past of adapting the current measures on a humanitarian basis rather than tightening the strangle hold the sanctions have on the people of iraq .
this is in direct opposition to the american and british opinion that threats of force and tougher sanctions will bring saddam 's regime into line .
delicate decisions at a time of inner divisions over iraq the german position is a delicate one .
a strong stance at home against military involvement aided the narrow re-election of schröder 's social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , but subsequent arguments within the spd and with coalition partners the green party have made the divisions over iraq embarrassingly public .
taking the arguments onto the international stage could be severely damaging to the administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
however , while chancellor schröder has reneged on many of his election promises , the main aim remains to keep germany out of any direct conflict in iraq .
but in recent weeks , the strong position has wavered with the definite borders of involvement set by the germans becoming increasingly blurred .
awacs and navy deployment may not be ' passive ' allowing the possible use of german air personnel as crews on awacs surveillance aircraft in a nato capacity could be seen as going beyond passive military support .
the united states has requested that 17 aircraft stationed in geilenkirchen , germany , part of 66 strong nato fleet of reconnaissance planes , be used in support of any american action against iraq .
the planes are manned by a multinational crew from 11 countries , nearly one-third of which is german .
in the event of a war against iraq the awacs are likely to be used to monitor turkish airspace .
the chancellor has defended his about-turn with statements of nato allegiance .
" germany will fulfill its obligations towards the alliance ... and that naturally also means protecting alliance territory , " he said on german television last wednesday .
another persuasive call from washington for further possible help came over the weekend when it was suggested that german naval vessels and personnel could be enlisted under their nato obligations to escort u.s. ships into the persian gulf .
defense minister peter struck , visiting german navy sailors on patrol off the horn of africa as part of operation enduring freedom , insisted the deployment of the german navy would not extend beyond its current anti-terrorist activities .
with increasingly high profile united nations positions on the horizon , the test of german resolve will have a larger audience and more extensive implications . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german navy warned of nato call-up for iraq german chancellor gerhard schroeder may find himself in yet another embarrassing position regarding decisions on iraq as the german navy gets warning of a potential call-up under its nato obligations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.12.2002 iraqi report could prove damaging to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volatile information - the weighty iraqi report on its weapons program iraq ’ s declaration of its weapons programs contains explosive news for germany , a berlin paper has reported .
the dossier is said to detail covert arms deals between german defense firms and iraq . just as the heated debates within the german government over the role of german troops and equipment in a possible war against iraq seem to be cooling down , another potential bombshell threatens to reignite the fires .
on tuesday , the berlin-based left-wing paper , tageszeitung reported that aspects of the 12,000-page iraqi report on iraq 's weapons programs , submitted to the u.n last week , could prove highly embarrassing for germany .
the newspaper - believed to be the first to have access to the top-secret dossier - has written that the iraqi declaration contains the names of 80 german firms , research laboratories and people , who are said to have helped iraq develop its weapons program .
germany , iraq ’ s number one arms supplier ?
the most contentious piece of news for germany is that the report names it as the number one supplier of weapons supplies to iraq .
german firms are supposed to easily outnumber the firms from other countries who have been exporting to iraq .
they have delivered technical know-how , components , basic substances and even entire technical facilities for the development of atomic , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to iraq right since 1975 .
in some cases , conventional military and technical dealings between germany and iraq are said to date till 2001 , ten years after the second gulf war and a time when international sanctions against saddam hussein are still in place .
the paper reports that the dossier contains several indications of cases , where german authorities right up to the finance ministry tolerated the illegal arms cooperation and also promoted to it to an extent .
wait and watch says german finance ministry the german finance ministry has said that it will react to the report only once it has studied the iraqi declaration .
" we ’ ll first wait till the report is in our hands , " a spokesman from the ministry said on tuesday .
the spokesman however said that the german government of the time in 1990 had informed the parliament about such german supplies to iraq .
ever since iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 , there has been a strict embargo against the country .
the spokesman said that there have been a few cases of violation of the embargo and the government has initiated investigations .
german military exports to iraq nothing new explosive as the newspaper report may appear , it ’ s not the first of its kind .
for months rumors have been circulating in the german media of murky deals between german arms companies and businessmen with iraq despite the rigid embargoes in place .
in october this year , a magazine of the german radio channel , südwestrundfunk reported that electronics giant siemens had delivered specialized technical equipment to iraq for the treatment of kidney stones , but which could also under certain circumstances be used as a detonator for atom bombs .
siemens insisted that the device could not be misused because it had commissioned an iraqi company to regularly monitor the equipment .
in fact the delivery was even sanctioned by the sanctions council of the u.n. and the federal office of economics and export control -lrb- bafa -rrb- .
the latest newspaper report also touches upon the gray zone between medicine and armaments and writes of so-called dual-use goods that can be used for developing weapons as well as for civilian purposes .
the german government was apparently informed in 1999 of the delivery of such dual-use goods to iraq , but is said to have turned a blind eye .
german defense firms conduct roaring trade with baghdad german arms companies in the meantime have been conducting booming business with iraq in recent years .
according to the german federal statistics office , german military exports to iraq have been steadily rising from year to year .
from annual exports amounting to 21,7 million euro in 1997 , the volume of exports for the following year shot to some 76,4 million euro .
the trend continued in 2001 with exports to iraq bringing german firms profits in the range of 336,5 million euro .
german goods worth 226,2 million euro have already been shipped to iraq in the first half of this year .
some of the official heavyweights in the export scene are the german electronics firm siemens with medical equipment and energy distribution systems and carmaker daimlerchrysler .
both are reported to rake in revenues worth double digit figures in the millions .
chancellor schröder in precarious situation though the german government has not officially reacted to the iraqi declaration detailing its role in supplying iraq with arms , there is little doubt that the issue is bound to stoke passions .
ever since chancellor gerhard schröder refused to be part of any military action in iraq before the german general elections in september , berlin ’ s relation to washington has been a strained one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder with schröder sticking to his pacifist line , but dithering over the level of cooperation with the u.s. in the case of a war against iraq , the latest report is guaranteed to provide ammunition to the opposition who have strongly criticized schröder ’ s policy towards america .
another real fear is that schröder ’ s image as a staunch pacifist might now be sullied if it emerges that germany has all along been helping the very leader who it has been unwilling to topple , to stockpile his weapons .
the report could also provide the u.s. with an excuse to step up the pressure on germany to give in to american military demands for deployment of german troops and use of german military equipment in the case of a military attack on iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
germany will join the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member next year and head the sanctions committee on iraq , a position that could place it at odds with its own stated foreign policy .

the dossier is said to detail covert arms deals between german defense firms and iraq . just as the heated debates within the german government over the role of german troops and equipment in a possible war against iraq seem to be cooling down , another potential bombshell threatens to reignite the fires .
on tuesday , the berlin-based left-wing paper , tageszeitung reported that aspects of the 12,000-page iraqi report on iraq 's weapons programs , submitted to the u.n last week , could prove highly embarrassing for germany .
the newspaper - believed to be the first to have access to the top-secret dossier - has written that the iraqi declaration contains the names of 80 german firms , research laboratories and people , who are said to have helped iraq develop its weapons program .
germany , iraq ’ s number one arms supplier ?
the most contentious piece of news for germany is that the report names it as the number one supplier of weapons supplies to iraq .
german firms are supposed to easily outnumber the firms from other countries who have been exporting to iraq .
they have delivered technical know-how , components , basic substances and even entire technical facilities for the development of atomic , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to iraq right since 1975 .
in some cases , conventional military and technical dealings between germany and iraq are said to date till 2001 , ten years after the second gulf war and a time when international sanctions against saddam hussein are still in place .
the paper reports that the dossier contains several indications of cases , where german authorities right up to the finance ministry tolerated the illegal arms cooperation and also promoted to it to an extent .
wait and watch says german finance ministry the german finance ministry has said that it will react to the report only once it has studied the iraqi declaration .
" we ’ ll first wait till the report is in our hands , " a spokesman from the ministry said on tuesday .
the spokesman however said that the german government of the time in 1990 had informed the parliament about such german supplies to iraq .
ever since iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 , there has been a strict embargo against the country .
the spokesman said that there have been a few cases of violation of the embargo and the government has initiated investigations .
german military exports to iraq nothing new explosive as the newspaper report may appear , it ’ s not the first of its kind .
for months rumors have been circulating in the german media of murky deals between german arms companies and businessmen with iraq despite the rigid embargoes in place .
in october this year , a magazine of the german radio channel , südwestrundfunk reported that electronics giant siemens had delivered specialized technical equipment to iraq for the treatment of kidney stones , but which could also under certain circumstances be used as a detonator for atom bombs .
siemens insisted that the device could not be misused because it had commissioned an iraqi company to regularly monitor the equipment .
in fact the delivery was even sanctioned by the sanctions council of the u.n. and the federal office of economics and export control -lrb- bafa -rrb- .
the latest newspaper report also touches upon the gray zone between medicine and armaments and writes of so-called dual-use goods that can be used for developing weapons as well as for civilian purposes .
the german government was apparently informed in 1999 of the delivery of such dual-use goods to iraq , but is said to have turned a blind eye .
german defense firms conduct roaring trade with baghdad german arms companies in the meantime have been conducting booming business with iraq in recent years .
according to the german federal statistics office , german military exports to iraq have been steadily rising from year to year .
from annual exports amounting to 21,7 million euro in 1997 , the volume of exports for the following year shot to some 76,4 million euro .
the trend continued in 2001 with exports to iraq bringing german firms profits in the range of 336,5 million euro .
german goods worth 226,2 million euro have already been shipped to iraq in the first half of this year .
some of the official heavyweights in the export scene are the german electronics firm siemens with medical equipment and energy distribution systems and carmaker daimlerchrysler .
both are reported to rake in revenues worth double digit figures in the millions .
chancellor schröder in precarious situation though the german government has not officially reacted to the iraqi declaration detailing its role in supplying iraq with arms , there is little doubt that the issue is bound to stoke passions .
ever since chancellor gerhard schröder refused to be part of any military action in iraq before the german general elections in september , berlin ’ s relation to washington has been a strained one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder with schröder sticking to his pacifist line , but dithering over the level of cooperation with the u.s. in the case of a war against iraq , the latest report is guaranteed to provide ammunition to the opposition who have strongly criticized schröder ’ s policy towards america .
another real fear is that schröder ’ s image as a staunch pacifist might now be sullied if it emerges that germany has all along been helping the very leader who it has been unwilling to topple , to stockpile his weapons .
the report could also provide the u.s. with an excuse to step up the pressure on germany to give in to american military demands for deployment of german troops and use of german military equipment in the case of a military attack on iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
germany will join the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member next year and head the sanctions committee on iraq , a position that could place it at odds with its own stated foreign policy .

the dossier is said to detail covert arms deals between german defense firms and iraq . just as the heated debates within the german government over the role of german troops and equipment in a possible war against iraq seem to be cooling down , another potential bombshell threatens to reignite the fires .
on tuesday , the berlin-based left-wing paper , tageszeitung reported that aspects of the 12,000-page iraqi report on iraq 's weapons programs , submitted to the u.n last week , could prove highly embarrassing for germany .
the newspaper - believed to be the first to have access to the top-secret dossier - has written that the iraqi declaration contains the names of 80 german firms , research laboratories and people , who are said to have helped iraq develop its weapons program .
germany , iraq ’ s number one arms supplier ?
the most contentious piece of news for germany is that the report names it as the number one supplier of weapons supplies to iraq .
german firms are supposed to easily outnumber the firms from other countries who have been exporting to iraq .
they have delivered technical know-how , components , basic substances and even entire technical facilities for the development of atomic , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to iraq right since 1975 .
in some cases , conventional military and technical dealings between germany and iraq are said to date till 2001 , ten years after the second gulf war and a time when international sanctions against saddam hussein are still in place .
the paper reports that the dossier contains several indications of cases , where german authorities right up to the finance ministry tolerated the illegal arms cooperation and also promoted to it to an extent .
wait and watch says german finance ministry the german finance ministry has said that it will react to the report only once it has studied the iraqi declaration .
" we ’ ll first wait till the report is in our hands , " a spokesman from the ministry said on tuesday .
the spokesman however said that the german government of the time in 1990 had informed the parliament about such german supplies to iraq .
ever since iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 , there has been a strict embargo against the country .
the spokesman said that there have been a few cases of violation of the embargo and the government has initiated investigations .
german military exports to iraq nothing new explosive as the newspaper report may appear , it ’ s not the first of its kind .
for months rumors have been circulating in the german media of murky deals between german arms companies and businessmen with iraq despite the rigid embargoes in place .
in october this year , a magazine of the german radio channel , südwestrundfunk reported that electronics giant siemens had delivered specialized technical equipment to iraq for the treatment of kidney stones , but which could also under certain circumstances be used as a detonator for atom bombs .
siemens insisted that the device could not be misused because it had commissioned an iraqi company to regularly monitor the equipment .
in fact the delivery was even sanctioned by the sanctions council of the u.n. and the federal office of economics and export control -lrb- bafa -rrb- .
the latest newspaper report also touches upon the gray zone between medicine and armaments and writes of so-called dual-use goods that can be used for developing weapons as well as for civilian purposes .
the german government was apparently informed in 1999 of the delivery of such dual-use goods to iraq , but is said to have turned a blind eye .
german defense firms conduct roaring trade with baghdad german arms companies in the meantime have been conducting booming business with iraq in recent years .
according to the german federal statistics office , german military exports to iraq have been steadily rising from year to year .
from annual exports amounting to 21,7 million euro in 1997 , the volume of exports for the following year shot to some 76,4 million euro .
the trend continued in 2001 with exports to iraq bringing german firms profits in the range of 336,5 million euro .
german goods worth 226,2 million euro have already been shipped to iraq in the first half of this year .
some of the official heavyweights in the export scene are the german electronics firm siemens with medical equipment and energy distribution systems and carmaker daimlerchrysler .
both are reported to rake in revenues worth double digit figures in the millions .
chancellor schröder in precarious situation though the german government has not officially reacted to the iraqi declaration detailing its role in supplying iraq with arms , there is little doubt that the issue is bound to stoke passions .
ever since chancellor gerhard schröder refused to be part of any military action in iraq before the german general elections in september , berlin ’ s relation to washington has been a strained one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder with schröder sticking to his pacifist line , but dithering over the level of cooperation with the u.s. in the case of a war against iraq , the latest report is guaranteed to provide ammunition to the opposition who have strongly criticized schröder ’ s policy towards america .
another real fear is that schröder ’ s image as a staunch pacifist might now be sullied if it emerges that germany has all along been helping the very leader who it has been unwilling to topple , to stockpile his weapons .

the eu will have access to a nato planning base in belgium , and will be able to use nato logistics and information resources . robertson called the new partnership “ a milestone in the history of relations between the nato and the eu . ” although closer cooperation has been in the works for a few years now , the move was only made possible by the change in turkey ’ s stance on the issue .
until last week , turkey – which belongs to nato but not to the eu – had blocked closer cooperation between the two organizations .
it feared its own security interests would be compromised vis-à-vis the island of cyprus which it co-governs with greece . turkey was forced to change its stance on the issue at last week ’ s eu enlargement summit in copenhagen .
there , france and germany heaped pressure on turkish prime minister abdullah gul to get turkey to stop blocking the berlin plus agreement . the pressure was set against the other conference decision on turkey : the eu will begin an assessment of turkey ’ s stance on human rights , democracy and its economy in october 2004 , with possible eu accession talks starting soon afterwards . giving credibility to pan-eu defence and security the european union decided to create its own military arm at the helsinki summit three years ago , when it launched plans for a european security and defence policy .
the move was seen as a natural step for the eu at a time when its influence in both political and economic realms continues to grow . the stated aim is a 60,000-strong european rapid reaction force intended for peace-keeping and humanitarian missions , which can be ready for deployment within 60 days and could remain in place for up to one year .
with nato ’ s cooperation , this will be up and running by 2003 . the first eu troops – who will wear their national uniforms with an added eu insignia – could be deployed within the next few weeks as the new eu forces take over operation " amber fox " in the balkan republic of macedonia .
and on january 1 , more than 500 eu troops will also take over a un peace-keeping mission in bosnia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european security and defense policy germany extends commitment in macedonia www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

the dossier is said to detail covert arms deals between german defense firms and iraq . just as the heated debates within the german government over the role of german troops and equipment in a possible war against iraq seem to be cooling down , another potential bombshell threatens to reignite the fires .
on tuesday , the berlin-based left-wing paper , tageszeitung reported that aspects of the 12,000-page iraqi report on iraq 's weapons programs , submitted to the u.n last week , could prove highly embarrassing for germany .
the newspaper - believed to be the first to have access to the top-secret dossier - has written that the iraqi declaration contains the names of 80 german firms , research laboratories and people , who are said to have helped iraq develop its weapons program .
germany , iraq ’ s number one arms supplier ?
the most contentious piece of news for germany is that the report names it as the number one supplier of weapons supplies to iraq .
german firms are supposed to easily outnumber the firms from other countries who have been exporting to iraq .
they have delivered technical know-how , components , basic substances and even entire technical facilities for the development of atomic , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to iraq right since 1975 .
in some cases , conventional military and technical dealings between germany and iraq are said to date till 2001 , ten years after the second gulf war and a time when international sanctions against saddam hussein are still in place .
the paper reports that the dossier contains several indications of cases , where german authorities right up to the finance ministry tolerated the illegal arms cooperation and also promoted to it to an extent .
wait and watch says german finance ministry the german finance ministry has said that it will react to the report only once it has studied the iraqi declaration .
" we ’ ll first wait till the report is in our hands , " a spokesman from the ministry said on tuesday .
the spokesman however said that the german government of the time in 1990 had informed the parliament about such german supplies to iraq .
ever since iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 , there has been a strict embargo against the country .
the spokesman said that there have been a few cases of violation of the embargo and the government has initiated investigations .
german military exports to iraq nothing new explosive as the newspaper report may appear , it ’ s not the first of its kind .
for months rumors have been circulating in the german media of murky deals between german arms companies and businessmen with iraq despite the rigid embargoes in place .
in october this year , a magazine of the german radio channel , südwestrundfunk reported that electronics giant siemens had delivered specialized technical equipment to iraq for the treatment of kidney stones , but which could also under certain circumstances be used as a detonator for atom bombs .
siemens insisted that the device could not be misused because it had commissioned an iraqi company to regularly monitor the equipment .
in fact the delivery was even sanctioned by the sanctions council of the u.n. and the federal office of economics and export control -lrb- bafa -rrb- .
the latest newspaper report also touches upon the gray zone between medicine and armaments and writes of so-called dual-use goods that can be used for developing weapons as well as for civilian purposes .
the german government was apparently informed in 1999 of the delivery of such dual-use goods to iraq , but is said to have turned a blind eye .
german defense firms conduct roaring trade with baghdad german arms companies in the meantime have been conducting booming business with iraq in recent years .
according to the german federal statistics office , german military exports to iraq have been steadily rising from year to year .
from annual exports amounting to 21,7 million euro in 1997 , the volume of exports for the following year shot to some 76,4 million euro .
the trend continued in 2001 with exports to iraq bringing german firms profits in the range of 336,5 million euro .

the first may come when germany is welcomed onto the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member from jan .
1 , 2003 .
every two years , five assembly members are invited to join the five permanent countries on the security council .
it will be germany 's fifth turn on the council with the current subject at the top of the agenda being iraq , a theme that must be regularly waking the german chancellor in a cold sweat these days .
as a member of the security council , germany will be called into the front line of decision-making that will dictate what action takes place should iraq fail to adhere to resolution 1441 surrounding its alleged weapons of mass destruction programs .
it could result in the ultimate test of germany 's foreign policy resolve with the united states and britain again pushing for military action and france , russia and china likely to throw spanners in the works once more .
support pre-emptive action or incur america 's wrath ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein .
it could be the chancellor 's hardest choice .
siding with the pre-emptive strike lobby would sit awkwardly with his election declaration that america 's apparent desire for war with saddam hussein would lead to a " reckless adventure . "
a german show of council support for such action would erase the last remnants of credibility the government has on its increasingly shaky anti-involvement policy .
presumably , schröder could claim un obligations as reason enough for his reversal .
sticking to its non-firing guns and opposing a military campaign to disarm the iraqi dictator would set the germans against the americans at a time when recent wounds in the relationship are beginning to slowly heal .
the political effects of a decision which would thwart u.s. plans would last years , even though they would be taken in a united nations context .
conflict between the two nations may also erupt over the international criminal court , which the united states vehemently opposes and the germans unconditionally support , and the current impasse in negotiations between israel and the palestinians .
germany will also have to contend with conflicting interests over the face-offs in kashmir and in various areas of africa .
sanctions committee provides further policy dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil workers in iraq .
another situation where german delegates might face tough decisions that clash with their own foreign policy will be the un 's sanctions committee on iraq .
germany takes over from norway as the head of the body which was set up in 1991 around un resolution 661 , which came into being after the gulf war .
the committee oversees the so-called oil for food program that governs the sale of medical and infrastructure supplies to iraq while restricting any goods that may be used for military purposes .
germany is a supporter of the sanctions against iraq as a way of controlling the development of weapons of mass destruction .
foreign minister joschka fischer has spoken in the past of adapting the current measures on a humanitarian basis rather than tightening the strangle hold the sanctions have on the people of iraq .
this is in direct opposition to the american and british opinion that threats of force and tougher sanctions will bring saddam 's regime into line .
delicate decisions at a time of inner divisions over iraq the german position is a delicate one .
a strong stance at home against military involvement aided the narrow re-election of schröder 's social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , but subsequent arguments within the spd and with coalition partners the green party have made the divisions over iraq embarrassingly public .
taking the arguments onto the international stage could be severely damaging to the administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
however , while chancellor schröder has reneged on many of his election promises , the main aim remains to keep germany out of any direct conflict in iraq .
but in recent weeks , the strong position has wavered with the definite borders of involvement set by the germans becoming increasingly blurred .
awacs and navy deployment may not be ' passive ' allowing the possible use of german air personnel as crews on awacs surveillance aircraft in a nato capacity could be seen as going beyond passive military support .
the united states has requested that 17 aircraft stationed in geilenkirchen , germany , part of 66 strong nato fleet of reconnaissance planes , be used in support of any american action against iraq .
the planes are manned by a multinational crew from 11 countries , nearly one-third of which is german .
in the event of a war against iraq the awacs are likely to be used to monitor turkish airspace .
the chancellor has defended his about-turn with statements of nato allegiance .
" germany will fulfill its obligations towards the alliance ... and that naturally also means protecting alliance territory , " he said on german television last wednesday .
another persuasive call from washington for further possible help came over the weekend when it was suggested that german naval vessels and personnel could be enlisted under their nato obligations to escort u.s. ships into the persian gulf .
defense minister peter struck , visiting german navy sailors on patrol off the horn of africa as part of operation enduring freedom , insisted the deployment of the german navy would not extend beyond its current anti-terrorist activities .

the dossier is said to detail covert arms deals between german defense firms and iraq . just as the heated debates within the german government over the role of german troops and equipment in a possible war against iraq seem to be cooling down , another potential bombshell threatens to reignite the fires .
on tuesday , the berlin-based left-wing paper , tageszeitung reported that aspects of the 12,000-page iraqi report on iraq 's weapons programs , submitted to the u.n last week , could prove highly embarrassing for germany .
the newspaper - believed to be the first to have access to the top-secret dossier - has written that the iraqi declaration contains the names of 80 german firms , research laboratories and people , who are said to have helped iraq develop its weapons program .
germany , iraq ’ s number one arms supplier ?
the most contentious piece of news for germany is that the report names it as the number one supplier of weapons supplies to iraq .
german firms are supposed to easily outnumber the firms from other countries who have been exporting to iraq .
they have delivered technical know-how , components , basic substances and even entire technical facilities for the development of atomic , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to iraq right since 1975 .
in some cases , conventional military and technical dealings between germany and iraq are said to date till 2001 , ten years after the second gulf war and a time when international sanctions against saddam hussein are still in place .
the paper reports that the dossier contains several indications of cases , where german authorities right up to the finance ministry tolerated the illegal arms cooperation and also promoted to it to an extent .
wait and watch says german finance ministry the german finance ministry has said that it will react to the report only once it has studied the iraqi declaration .
" we ’ ll first wait till the report is in our hands , " a spokesman from the ministry said on tuesday .
the spokesman however said that the german government of the time in 1990 had informed the parliament about such german supplies to iraq .
ever since iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 , there has been a strict embargo against the country .
the spokesman said that there have been a few cases of violation of the embargo and the government has initiated investigations .
german military exports to iraq nothing new explosive as the newspaper report may appear , it ’ s not the first of its kind .
for months rumors have been circulating in the german media of murky deals between german arms companies and businessmen with iraq despite the rigid embargoes in place .
in october this year , a magazine of the german radio channel , südwestrundfunk reported that electronics giant siemens had delivered specialized technical equipment to iraq for the treatment of kidney stones , but which could also under certain circumstances be used as a detonator for atom bombs .
siemens insisted that the device could not be misused because it had commissioned an iraqi company to regularly monitor the equipment .
in fact the delivery was even sanctioned by the sanctions council of the u.n. and the federal office of economics and export control -lrb- bafa -rrb- .
the latest newspaper report also touches upon the gray zone between medicine and armaments and writes of so-called dual-use goods that can be used for developing weapons as well as for civilian purposes .
the german government was apparently informed in 1999 of the delivery of such dual-use goods to iraq , but is said to have turned a blind eye .
german defense firms conduct roaring trade with baghdad german arms companies in the meantime have been conducting booming business with iraq in recent years .
according to the german federal statistics office , german military exports to iraq have been steadily rising from year to year .
from annual exports amounting to 21,7 million euro in 1997 , the volume of exports for the following year shot to some 76,4 million euro .
the trend continued in 2001 with exports to iraq bringing german firms profits in the range of 336,5 million euro .
german goods worth 226,2 million euro have already been shipped to iraq in the first half of this year .
some of the official heavyweights in the export scene are the german electronics firm siemens with medical equipment and energy distribution systems and carmaker daimlerchrysler .
both are reported to rake in revenues worth double digit figures in the millions .
chancellor schröder in precarious situation though the german government has not officially reacted to the iraqi declaration detailing its role in supplying iraq with arms , there is little doubt that the issue is bound to stoke passions .
ever since chancellor gerhard schröder refused to be part of any military action in iraq before the german general elections in september , berlin ’ s relation to washington has been a strained one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder with schröder sticking to his pacifist line , but dithering over the level of cooperation with the u.s. in the case of a war against iraq , the latest report is guaranteed to provide ammunition to the opposition who have strongly criticized schröder ’ s policy towards america .
another real fear is that schröder ’ s image as a staunch pacifist might now be sullied if it emerges that germany has all along been helping the very leader who it has been unwilling to topple , to stockpile his weapons .
the report could also provide the u.s. with an excuse to step up the pressure on germany to give in to american military demands for deployment of german troops and use of german military equipment in the case of a military attack on iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?

the eu will have access to a nato planning base in belgium , and will be able to use nato logistics and information resources . robertson called the new partnership “ a milestone in the history of relations between the nato and the eu . ” although closer cooperation has been in the works for a few years now , the move was only made possible by the change in turkey ’ s stance on the issue .
until last week , turkey – which belongs to nato but not to the eu – had blocked closer cooperation between the two organizations .
it feared its own security interests would be compromised vis-à-vis the island of cyprus which it co-governs with greece . turkey was forced to change its stance on the issue at last week ’ s eu enlargement summit in copenhagen .
there , france and germany heaped pressure on turkish prime minister abdullah gul to get turkey to stop blocking the berlin plus agreement . the pressure was set against the other conference decision on turkey : the eu will begin an assessment of turkey ’ s stance on human rights , democracy and its economy in october 2004 , with possible eu accession talks starting soon afterwards . giving credibility to pan-eu defence and security the european union decided to create its own military arm at the helsinki summit three years ago , when it launched plans for a european security and defence policy .
the move was seen as a natural step for the eu at a time when its influence in both political and economic realms continues to grow . the stated aim is a 60,000-strong european rapid reaction force intended for peace-keeping and humanitarian missions , which can be ready for deployment within 60 days and could remain in place for up to one year .
with nato ’ s cooperation , this will be up and running by 2003 . the first eu troops – who will wear their national uniforms with an added eu insignia – could be deployed within the next few weeks as the new eu forces take over operation " amber fox " in the balkan republic of macedonia .
and on january 1 , more than 500 eu troops will also take over a un peace-keeping mission in bosnia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european security and defense policy germany extends commitment in macedonia www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

every two years , five assembly members are invited to join the five permanent countries on the security council .
it will be germany 's fifth turn on the council with the current subject at the top of the agenda being iraq , a theme that must be regularly waking the german chancellor in a cold sweat these days .
as a member of the security council , germany will be called into the front line of decision-making that will dictate what action takes place should iraq fail to adhere to resolution 1441 surrounding its alleged weapons of mass destruction programs .
it could result in the ultimate test of germany 's foreign policy resolve with the united states and britain again pushing for military action and france , russia and china likely to throw spanners in the works once more .

it could be the chancellor 's hardest choice .
siding with the pre-emptive strike lobby would sit awkwardly with his election declaration that america 's apparent desire for war with saddam hussein would lead to a " reckless adventure . "

presumably , schröder could claim un obligations as reason enough for his reversal .
sticking to its non-firing guns and opposing a military campaign to disarm the iraqi dictator would set the germans against the americans at a time when recent wounds in the relationship are beginning to slowly heal .
the political effects of a decision which would thwart u.s. plans would last years , even though they would be taken in a united nations context .
conflict between the two nations may also erupt over the international criminal court , which the united states vehemently opposes and the germans unconditionally support , and the current impasse in negotiations between israel and the palestinians .
germany will also have to contend with conflicting interests over the face-offs in kashmir and in various areas of africa .

germany takes over from norway as the head of the body which was set up in 1991 around un resolution 661 , which came into being after the gulf war .
the committee oversees the so-called oil for food program that governs the sale of medical and infrastructure supplies to iraq while restricting any goods that may be used for military purposes .
germany is a supporter of the sanctions against iraq as a way of controlling the development of weapons of mass destruction .
foreign minister joschka fischer has spoken in the past of adapting the current measures on a humanitarian basis rather than tightening the strangle hold the sanctions have on the people of iraq .
this is in direct opposition to the american and british opinion that threats of force and tougher sanctions will bring saddam 's regime into line .
delicate decisions at a time of inner divisions over iraq the german position is a delicate one .
a strong stance at home against military involvement aided the narrow re-election of schröder 's social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , but subsequent arguments within the spd and with coalition partners the green party have made the divisions over iraq embarrassingly public .

awacs and navy deployment may not be ' passive ' allowing the possible use of german air personnel as crews on awacs surveillance aircraft in a nato capacity could be seen as going beyond passive military support .
the united states has requested that 17 aircraft stationed in geilenkirchen , germany , part of 66 strong nato fleet of reconnaissance planes , be used in support of any american action against iraq .
the planes are manned by a multinational crew from 11 countries , nearly one-third of which is german .
in the event of a war against iraq the awacs are likely to be used to monitor turkish airspace .
the chancellor has defended his about-turn with statements of nato allegiance .
" germany will fulfill its obligations towards the alliance ... and that naturally also means protecting alliance territory , " he said on german television last wednesday .
another persuasive call from washington for further possible help came over the weekend when it was suggested that german naval vessels and personnel could be enlisted under their nato obligations to escort u.s. ships into the persian gulf .

the eu will have access to a nato planning base in belgium , and will be able to use nato logistics and information resources . robertson called the new partnership “ a milestone in the history of relations between the nato and the eu . ” although closer cooperation has been in the works for a few years now , the move was only made possible by the change in turkey ’ s stance on the issue .
until last week , turkey – which belongs to nato but not to the eu – had blocked closer cooperation between the two organizations .
it feared its own security interests would be compromised vis-à-vis the island of cyprus which it co-governs with greece . turkey was forced to change its stance on the issue at last week ’ s eu enlargement summit in copenhagen .
there , france and germany heaped pressure on turkish prime minister abdullah gul to get turkey to stop blocking the berlin plus agreement . the pressure was set against the other conference decision on turkey : the eu will begin an assessment of turkey ’ s stance on human rights , democracy and its economy in october 2004 , with possible eu accession talks starting soon afterwards . giving credibility to pan-eu defence and security the european union decided to create its own military arm at the helsinki summit three years ago , when it launched plans for a european security and defence policy .
the move was seen as a natural step for the eu at a time when its influence in both political and economic realms continues to grow . the stated aim is a 60,000-strong european rapid reaction force intended for peace-keeping and humanitarian missions , which can be ready for deployment within 60 days and could remain in place for up to one year .
with nato ’ s cooperation , this will be up and running by 2003 . the first eu troops – who will wear their national uniforms with an added eu insignia – could be deployed within the next few weeks as the new eu forces take over operation " amber fox " in the balkan republic of macedonia .

the eu will have access to a nato planning base in belgium , and will be able to use nato logistics and information resources . robertson called the new partnership “ a milestone in the history of relations between the nato and the eu . ” although closer cooperation has been in the works for a few years now , the move was only made possible by the change in turkey ’ s stance on the issue .
until last week , turkey – which belongs to nato but not to the eu – had blocked closer cooperation between the two organizations .
it feared its own security interests would be compromised vis-à-vis the island of cyprus which it co-governs with greece . turkey was forced to change its stance on the issue at last week ’ s eu enlargement summit in copenhagen .
there , france and germany heaped pressure on turkish prime minister abdullah gul to get turkey to stop blocking the berlin plus agreement . the pressure was set against the other conference decision on turkey : the eu will begin an assessment of turkey ’ s stance on human rights , democracy and its economy in october 2004 , with possible eu accession talks starting soon afterwards . giving credibility to pan-eu defence and security the european union decided to create its own military arm at the helsinki summit three years ago , when it launched plans for a european security and defence policy .
the move was seen as a natural step for the eu at a time when its influence in both political and economic realms continues to grow . the stated aim is a 60,000-strong european rapid reaction force intended for peace-keeping and humanitarian missions , which can be ready for deployment within 60 days and could remain in place for up to one year .
with nato ’ s cooperation , this will be up and running by 2003 . the first eu troops – who will wear their national uniforms with an added eu insignia – could be deployed within the next few weeks as the new eu forces take over operation " amber fox " in the balkan republic of macedonia .
and on january 1 , more than 500 eu troops will also take over a un peace-keeping mission in bosnia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european security and defense policy germany extends commitment in macedonia www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

the dossier is said to detail covert arms deals between german defense firms and iraq . just as the heated debates within the german government over the role of german troops and equipment in a possible war against iraq seem to be cooling down , another potential bombshell threatens to reignite the fires .
on tuesday , the berlin-based left-wing paper , tageszeitung reported that aspects of the 12,000-page iraqi report on iraq 's weapons programs , submitted to the u.n last week , could prove highly embarrassing for germany .
the newspaper - believed to be the first to have access to the top-secret dossier - has written that the iraqi declaration contains the names of 80 german firms , research laboratories and people , who are said to have helped iraq develop its weapons program .
germany , iraq ’ s number one arms supplier ?
the most contentious piece of news for germany is that the report names it as the number one supplier of weapons supplies to iraq .
german firms are supposed to easily outnumber the firms from other countries who have been exporting to iraq .
they have delivered technical know-how , components , basic substances and even entire technical facilities for the development of atomic , chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction to iraq right since 1975 .
in some cases , conventional military and technical dealings between germany and iraq are said to date till 2001 , ten years after the second gulf war and a time when international sanctions against saddam hussein are still in place .
the paper reports that the dossier contains several indications of cases , where german authorities right up to the finance ministry tolerated the illegal arms cooperation and also promoted to it to an extent .
wait and watch says german finance ministry the german finance ministry has said that it will react to the report only once it has studied the iraqi declaration .
" we ’ ll first wait till the report is in our hands , " a spokesman from the ministry said on tuesday .
the spokesman however said that the german government of the time in 1990 had informed the parliament about such german supplies to iraq .
ever since iraq invaded kuwait in 1990 , there has been a strict embargo against the country .
the spokesman said that there have been a few cases of violation of the embargo and the government has initiated investigations .
german military exports to iraq nothing new explosive as the newspaper report may appear , it ’ s not the first of its kind .
for months rumors have been circulating in the german media of murky deals between german arms companies and businessmen with iraq despite the rigid embargoes in place .
in october this year , a magazine of the german radio channel , südwestrundfunk reported that electronics giant siemens had delivered specialized technical equipment to iraq for the treatment of kidney stones , but which could also under certain circumstances be used as a detonator for atom bombs .
siemens insisted that the device could not be misused because it had commissioned an iraqi company to regularly monitor the equipment .
in fact the delivery was even sanctioned by the sanctions council of the u.n. and the federal office of economics and export control -lrb- bafa -rrb- .
the latest newspaper report also touches upon the gray zone between medicine and armaments and writes of so-called dual-use goods that can be used for developing weapons as well as for civilian purposes .
the german government was apparently informed in 1999 of the delivery of such dual-use goods to iraq , but is said to have turned a blind eye .
german defense firms conduct roaring trade with baghdad german arms companies in the meantime have been conducting booming business with iraq in recent years .
according to the german federal statistics office , german military exports to iraq have been steadily rising from year to year .
from annual exports amounting to 21,7 million euro in 1997 , the volume of exports for the following year shot to some 76,4 million euro .
the trend continued in 2001 with exports to iraq bringing german firms profits in the range of 336,5 million euro .
german goods worth 226,2 million euro have already been shipped to iraq in the first half of this year .
some of the official heavyweights in the export scene are the german electronics firm siemens with medical equipment and energy distribution systems and carmaker daimlerchrysler .
both are reported to rake in revenues worth double digit figures in the millions .
chancellor schröder in precarious situation though the german government has not officially reacted to the iraqi declaration detailing its role in supplying iraq with arms , there is little doubt that the issue is bound to stoke passions .
ever since chancellor gerhard schröder refused to be part of any military action in iraq before the german general elections in september , berlin ’ s relation to washington has been a strained one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder with schröder sticking to his pacifist line , but dithering over the level of cooperation with the u.s. in the case of a war against iraq , the latest report is guaranteed to provide ammunition to the opposition who have strongly criticized schröder ’ s policy towards america .
another real fear is that schröder ’ s image as a staunch pacifist might now be sullied if it emerges that germany has all along been helping the very leader who it has been unwilling to topple , to stockpile his weapons .

the eu will have access to a nato planning base in belgium , and will be able to use nato logistics and information resources . robertson called the new partnership “ a milestone in the history of relations between the nato and the eu . ” although closer cooperation has been in the works for a few years now , the move was only made possible by the change in turkey ’ s stance on the issue .
until last week , turkey – which belongs to nato but not to the eu – had blocked closer cooperation between the two organizations .
it feared its own security interests would be compromised vis-à-vis the island of cyprus which it co-governs with greece . turkey was forced to change its stance on the issue at last week ’ s eu enlargement summit in copenhagen .
there , france and germany heaped pressure on turkish prime minister abdullah gul to get turkey to stop blocking the berlin plus agreement . the pressure was set against the other conference decision on turkey : the eu will begin an assessment of turkey ’ s stance on human rights , democracy and its economy in october 2004 , with possible eu accession talks starting soon afterwards . giving credibility to pan-eu defence and security the european union decided to create its own military arm at the helsinki summit three years ago , when it launched plans for a european security and defence policy .
the move was seen as a natural step for the eu at a time when its influence in both political and economic realms continues to grow . the stated aim is a 60,000-strong european rapid reaction force intended for peace-keeping and humanitarian missions , which can be ready for deployment within 60 days and could remain in place for up to one year .
with nato ’ s cooperation , this will be up and running by 2003 . the first eu troops – who will wear their national uniforms with an added eu insignia – could be deployed within the next few weeks as the new eu forces take over operation " amber fox " in the balkan republic of macedonia .
and on january 1 , more than 500 eu troops will also take over a un peace-keeping mission in bosnia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european security and defense policy germany extends commitment in macedonia www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

the first may come when germany is welcomed onto the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member from jan .
1 , 2003 .
every two years , five assembly members are invited to join the five permanent countries on the security council .
it will be germany 's fifth turn on the council with the current subject at the top of the agenda being iraq , a theme that must be regularly waking the german chancellor in a cold sweat these days .
as a member of the security council , germany will be called into the front line of decision-making that will dictate what action takes place should iraq fail to adhere to resolution 1441 surrounding its alleged weapons of mass destruction programs .
it could result in the ultimate test of germany 's foreign policy resolve with the united states and britain again pushing for military action and france , russia and china likely to throw spanners in the works once more .
support pre-emptive action or incur america 's wrath ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saddam hussein .
it could be the chancellor 's hardest choice .
siding with the pre-emptive strike lobby would sit awkwardly with his election declaration that america 's apparent desire for war with saddam hussein would lead to a " reckless adventure . "
a german show of council support for such action would erase the last remnants of credibility the government has on its increasingly shaky anti-involvement policy .
presumably , schröder could claim un obligations as reason enough for his reversal .
sticking to its non-firing guns and opposing a military campaign to disarm the iraqi dictator would set the germans against the americans at a time when recent wounds in the relationship are beginning to slowly heal .
the political effects of a decision which would thwart u.s. plans would last years , even though they would be taken in a united nations context .
conflict between the two nations may also erupt over the international criminal court , which the united states vehemently opposes and the germans unconditionally support , and the current impasse in negotiations between israel and the palestinians .
germany will also have to contend with conflicting interests over the face-offs in kashmir and in various areas of africa .
sanctions committee provides further policy dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil workers in iraq .
another situation where german delegates might face tough decisions that clash with their own foreign policy will be the un 's sanctions committee on iraq .
germany takes over from norway as the head of the body which was set up in 1991 around un resolution 661 , which came into being after the gulf war .
the committee oversees the so-called oil for food program that governs the sale of medical and infrastructure supplies to iraq while restricting any goods that may be used for military purposes .
germany is a supporter of the sanctions against iraq as a way of controlling the development of weapons of mass destruction .
foreign minister joschka fischer has spoken in the past of adapting the current measures on a humanitarian basis rather than tightening the strangle hold the sanctions have on the people of iraq .
this is in direct opposition to the american and british opinion that threats of force and tougher sanctions will bring saddam 's regime into line .
delicate decisions at a time of inner divisions over iraq the german position is a delicate one .
a strong stance at home against military involvement aided the narrow re-election of schröder 's social democrat party -lrb- spd -rrb- , but subsequent arguments within the spd and with coalition partners the green party have made the divisions over iraq embarrassingly public .
taking the arguments onto the international stage could be severely damaging to the administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
however , while chancellor schröder has reneged on many of his election promises , the main aim remains to keep germany out of any direct conflict in iraq .
but in recent weeks , the strong position has wavered with the definite borders of involvement set by the germans becoming increasingly blurred .
awacs and navy deployment may not be ' passive ' allowing the possible use of german air personnel as crews on awacs surveillance aircraft in a nato capacity could be seen as going beyond passive military support .
the united states has requested that 17 aircraft stationed in geilenkirchen , germany , part of 66 strong nato fleet of reconnaissance planes , be used in support of any american action against iraq .
the planes are manned by a multinational crew from 11 countries , nearly one-third of which is german .
in the event of a war against iraq the awacs are likely to be used to monitor turkish airspace .
the chancellor has defended his about-turn with statements of nato allegiance .
" germany will fulfill its obligations towards the alliance ... and that naturally also means protecting alliance territory , " he said on german television last wednesday .
another persuasive call from washington for further possible help came over the weekend when it was suggested that german naval vessels and personnel could be enlisted under their nato obligations to escort u.s. ships into the persian gulf .
defense minister peter struck , visiting german navy sailors on patrol off the horn of africa as part of operation enduring freedom , insisted the deployment of the german navy would not extend beyond its current anti-terrorist activities .
with increasingly high profile united nations positions on the horizon , the test of german resolve will have a larger audience and more extensive implications . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german navy warned of nato call-up for iraq german chancellor gerhard schroeder may find himself in yet another embarrassing position regarding decisions on iraq as the german navy gets warning of a potential call-up under its nato obligations .

research by the university of hertfordshire showed a third of fathers spent more than 50 hours a week in the office , compared with a quarter of childless men and one in 20 childless women doing equivalent time . "
british fathers are putting in such long hours at work that they are missing out on valuable time with their children " dr christine cousins hectic work schedules meant eight out of 10 respondents had difficulty fulfilling family duties and household tasks .
according to the survey , which questioned 945 people aged between 18 and 64 years old , fathers said they worked long hours to provide for their children , but wanted to be more involved in their youngsters ' lives .
almost two-fifths said they would prefer to work fewer hours with two-thirds of these giving spending more time with their family as the reason .
euro dads dr christine cousins , co-author of the report , said : " british fathers are putting in such long hours at work that they are missing out on valuable time with their children .
" it seems we could learn a thing or two from our west european cousins in the netherlands and sweden who have a more balanced home and work life . "
working dads 40 % want less hours 33 % work 50 hours a week 80 % can not manage family chores 80 % work late or weekends the research , which is part of an eu study , showed fathers in britain work longer hours than their european counterparts .
four in 10 fathers work more than the 48 hours per week specified by the eu working time directive , compared with two in 10 fathers in the netherlands and in sweden .
in the past decade the british working week has lengthened with eight out of 10 fathers working late at least once a week or at weekends , which compares with fewer than half of female respondents without children and two-thirds of childless men .
the survey is part of an eu framework project including eight participating countries in central , east and west europe .
do you feel you work too many hours that take you away from your children ?
your reaction " the word my son hears most from me is ' goodbye ' " stuart underwood , england i do not think fathers are at all well looked after in the uk .
i get two days fully paid paternity leave and will soon be able to take up to two more weeks off when i will be paid less than £ 100 a week .
help with childcare is means tested and all in all i have no choice but to work all the overtime i can to stop my family sinking deeper and deeper into debt .
having children is a huge financial burden .
i would love to spend more time with my wife and son but i know this is never going to happen .
the word my son hears most from me is " goodbye " .
stuart underwood , england there is often a way to get more time but many men either do n't want to , or are n't prepared to take the risk of finding another option .
i gave up a well-paid job that demanded long hours for one that paid less closer to home .
mike , uk i will probably never make it as employee of the year and that my chances of reaching senior management have been dented , but there are some things that money can not buy and seeing your young child grow up and develop is one of them .
adam , scotland of course i want to work fewer hours and see more of my kids .
i see my kids at bedtime during the week if i 'm lucky .
however , i need to work to earn money , and i 'm terrified of losing my job .
any answers ?
steve cahill , england i used to be guilty of working too many hours , then the wife was rushed into hospital and my life changed .
i realised what was important and now work 40 ish hours a week and spend time with my son .
material things can be bought later , my son growing up is once in a lifetime .
companies will only continue to harass the workforce into working long hours whilst the workforce lets them .
r how , uk husbands are sometimes unfairly accused of spending too little time with the wife / family .
in fact it is harder for us to live two lives - one of the tension in the office and being the bread provider as well as being caring husbands and fathers when we return from work .

working dads 40 % want less hours 33 % work 50 hours a week 80 % can not manage family chores 80 % work late or weekends the research , which is part of an eu study , showed fathers in britain work longer hours than their european counterparts .
four in 10 fathers work more than the 48 hours per week specified by the eu working time directive , compared with two in 10 fathers in the netherlands and in sweden .
in the past decade the british working week has lengthened with eight out of 10 fathers working late at least once a week or at weekends , which compares with fewer than half of female respondents without children and two-thirds of childless men .
the survey is part of an eu framework project including eight participating countries in central , east and west europe .
do you feel you work too many hours that take you away from your children ?
your reaction the word my son hears most from me is ' goodbye ' stuart underwood , england i do not think fathers are at all well looked after in the uk .
i get two days fully paid paternity leave and will soon be able to take up to two more weeks off when i will be paid less than £ 100 a week .
help with childcare is means tested and all in all i have no choice but to work all the overtime i can to stop my family sinking deeper and deeper into debt .
having children is a huge financial burden .
i would love to spend more time with my wife and son but i know this is never going to happen .
the word my son hears most from me is " goodbye " .
stuart underwood , england there is often a way to get more time but many men either do n't want to , or are n't prepared to take the risk of finding another option .
i gave up a well-paid job that demanded long hours for one that paid less closer to home .
mike , uk i will probably never make it as employee of the year and that my chances of reaching senior management have been dented , but there are some things that money can not buy and seeing your young child grow up and develop is one of them .
adam , scotland of course i want to work fewer hours and see more of my kids .
i see my kids at bedtime during the week if i 'm lucky .
however , i need to work to earn money , and i 'm terrified of losing my job .
any answers ?
steve cahill , england i used to be guilty of working too many hours , then the wife was rushed into hospital and my life changed .
i realised what was important and now work 40 ish hours a week and spend time with my son .
material things can be bought later , my son growing up is once in a lifetime .
companies will only continue to harass the workforce into working long hours whilst the workforce lets them .
r how , uk husbands are sometimes unfairly accused of spending too little time with the wife / family .
in fact it is harder for us to live two lives - one of the tension in the office and being the bread provider as well as being caring husbands and fathers when we return from work .

the executives of the argyll and clyde nhs board quit after the report found the region where they were working was beset by infighting .
a culture of managerial and financial incompetence was also uncovered and the health authority is now facing debts of up to £ 30m .
pressure had been mounting on the managers to go and they were offered a choice of resigning or being sacked .
they took the option with a pay-off .
i 'm determined that we see management approaches adopted that devolve responsibility and decision-making to staff who are directly involved in delivering health care malcolm chisholm health minister health minister malcolm chisholm ordered a support team to investigate the relationship between the board and the three nhs trusts in the area .
mr chisholm acted after concerns were raised about the way health services were being run .
the three-man support team , which delivered its findings to the health board on monday night , found a catalogue of problems .
they included a lack of any clear direction , a " them and us " culture between the board and trusts , and financial shortcomings .
ineffective relationships with the local authority , clinicians and other stakeholders , as well as a lack of understanding of a financial shortfall of between £ 25m and £ 30m were also found by the team .
maternity closure the chief executives of the board and the three trusts have all stepped down .
the men who quit were neil mcconachie of argyll and clyde nhs trust ; david sillito of argyll and clyde acute hospitals ; michael bews of lomond and argyll primary care ; and george buchanan of renfrewshire and inverclyde primary care .
the issue came to a head in october when vale of leven hospital 's maternity unit was forced to close when the resignation of an on-call doctor left it short of cover .
mr chisholm ordered the support team , made up of two external nhs chiefs and an advisor from pricewaterhousecoopers , to go in after argyll and bute council asked him to intervene .
maternity services were affected an interim management team has been put in place to run healthcare services in the region until a new management structure is established .
mr chisholm welcomed the changes , saying that patients would benefit from a new approach .
he said : " i am absolutely determined that we see management approaches adopted that devolve responsibility and decision-making to staff who are directly involved in delivering health care .
" that is the best way to achieve an effective health service which responds directly to patients ' needs and which motivates staff to really give of their best . "
' work together ' mr chisholm added : " nhs argyll and clyde now needs to look ahead . "
john mullin , chairman of nhs argyll and clyde , said efforts would now be directed at re-establishing confidence with the general public , patients and staff .
he said : " we will work together to remove organisational and bureaucratic barriers . "
