but opinion polls indicate that schröder may no longer be in power when it goes into effect . german finance minister hans eichel has an ambitious goal .
in four years time , he wants to present germany 's first balanced budget since 1970 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel on wednesday , eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- made some progress towards that goal , when the cabinet approved his draft budget for 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's draft , spending will decrease by 0.5 percent to 246.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 234.5 billion -rrb- and new borrowing will be cut from 21 billion euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- this year to 15.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.75 billion -rrb- in 2003 .
promises to balance the budget chancellor schröder 's government has made cutting spending one of its top priorities .
it does n't want to burden future generations with high interest payments on old debts .
in addition , schröder 's government narrowly avoided an eu warning about its high budget deficit in february .
last year , germany 's deficit rose to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
that 's dangerously close to the three percent eu limit that ensures the stability of the euro .
the german government was only able to avoid an embarrassing eu rebuke by promising to bring the country 's budget close to balance .
but economists and germany 's conservative opposition immediately criticized the finance minister 's pledge as unrealistic .
hans eichel 's reduced budget for 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless germans waiting at the employment office the biggest single item in eichel 's draft for 2003 is the labor minister 's budget .
it will increase by 1.3 percent in 2003 to 93.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 88.9 billion -rrb- because of germany 's high jobless rate .
around four million people are out of work in germany .
the finance minister 's draft is based on the assumption that the number of unemployed will go down to 3.8 million next year .
more people working would mean more people paying taxes , and therefore higher revenues and less spending on unemployment .
the second biggest chunk of the budget – though considerably smaller than that of the labor ministry - will go to the federal ministry of transport , building and housing .
at 26.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- , it remains roughly unchanged from this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german recruits the defense budget is the third-biggest item of the draft .
it 's set to increase in by 3.3 percent in 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's planning , the defense minister will have 23.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 23.2 billion -rrb- to spend next year .
government approves 2003 draft budget on wednesday , eichel had no problems getting the other government ministers to approve his draft budget for 2003 .
however this was only one small step on a long rocky road for eichel .
the draft still has to be approved by parliament , which is set to debate the budget plan after the september elections .
by then , eichel may no longer be in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber recent polls show schröder 's government coalition trailing behind his conservative opponent edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- .
germany 's conservative opposition has already made clear that it will thoroughly rework hans eichel 's budget plan in case of an election victory .
opposition is critical the conservatives criticized that eichel 's draft budget was based on wrong assumptions .
dietrich austermann , a budget expert with the christian democrats , said it was risky to assume gdp would grow by 2.5 percent .
if it failed to reach that target , important cornerstones of the budget would not be met .
austermann said that if the conservatives win the september election , they will cut spending even more .
they want to introduce more flexibility in the german labor market and they plan to reform the country 's pensions system .
austermann also announced the conservatives would save money by cutting back subsidies for what he called " pet projects " of the present government – ecological farming for instance .
but some economists say the conservatives ' plans for reforming the country 's finances are just as vague as those of the present government .
stoiber , the opposition candidate for chancellor , announced ambitious economic plans and projects a few weeks ago .
when journalists asked how he would finance them , however , stoiber 's answer was simply through the economic upswing that his government would bring about . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germany ca n't fund eu expansion the chancellor says germany will be unable to bring its household budget in order while at the same time providing agricultural subsidies to the eu 's eastern european accession states .

but opinion polls indicate that schröder may no longer be in power when it goes into effect . german finance minister hans eichel has an ambitious goal .
in four years time , he wants to present germany 's first balanced budget since 1970 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel on wednesday , eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- made some progress towards that goal , when the cabinet approved his draft budget for 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's draft , spending will decrease by 0.5 percent to 246.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 234.5 billion -rrb- and new borrowing will be cut from 21 billion euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- this year to 15.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.75 billion -rrb- in 2003 .
promises to balance the budget chancellor schröder 's government has made cutting spending one of its top priorities .
it does n't want to burden future generations with high interest payments on old debts .
in addition , schröder 's government narrowly avoided an eu warning about its high budget deficit in february .
last year , germany 's deficit rose to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
that 's dangerously close to the three percent eu limit that ensures the stability of the euro .
the german government was only able to avoid an embarrassing eu rebuke by promising to bring the country 's budget close to balance .
but economists and germany 's conservative opposition immediately criticized the finance minister 's pledge as unrealistic .
hans eichel 's reduced budget for 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless germans waiting at the employment office the biggest single item in eichel 's draft for 2003 is the labor minister 's budget .
it will increase by 1.3 percent in 2003 to 93.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 88.9 billion -rrb- because of germany 's high jobless rate .
around four million people are out of work in germany .
the finance minister 's draft is based on the assumption that the number of unemployed will go down to 3.8 million next year .
more people working would mean more people paying taxes , and therefore higher revenues and less spending on unemployment .
the second biggest chunk of the budget – though considerably smaller than that of the labor ministry - will go to the federal ministry of transport , building and housing .
at 26.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- , it remains roughly unchanged from this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german recruits the defense budget is the third-biggest item of the draft .
it 's set to increase in by 3.3 percent in 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's planning , the defense minister will have 23.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 23.2 billion -rrb- to spend next year .
government approves 2003 draft budget on wednesday , eichel had no problems getting the other government ministers to approve his draft budget for 2003 .
however this was only one small step on a long rocky road for eichel .
the draft still has to be approved by parliament , which is set to debate the budget plan after the september elections .
by then , eichel may no longer be in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber recent polls show schröder 's government coalition trailing behind his conservative opponent edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- .
germany 's conservative opposition has already made clear that it will thoroughly rework hans eichel 's budget plan in case of an election victory .
opposition is critical the conservatives criticized that eichel 's draft budget was based on wrong assumptions .
dietrich austermann , a budget expert with the christian democrats , said it was risky to assume gdp would grow by 2.5 percent .
if it failed to reach that target , important cornerstones of the budget would not be met .
austermann said that if the conservatives win the september election , they will cut spending even more .
they want to introduce more flexibility in the german labor market and they plan to reform the country 's pensions system .
austermann also announced the conservatives would save money by cutting back subsidies for what he called " pet projects " of the present government – ecological farming for instance .
but some economists say the conservatives ' plans for reforming the country 's finances are just as vague as those of the present government .
stoiber , the opposition candidate for chancellor , announced ambitious economic plans and projects a few weeks ago .
when journalists asked how he would finance them , however , stoiber 's answer was simply through the economic upswing that his government would bring about . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germany ca n't fund eu expansion the chancellor says germany will be unable to bring its household budget in order while at the same time providing agricultural subsidies to the eu 's eastern european accession states .

but opinion polls indicate that schröder may no longer be in power when it goes into effect . german finance minister hans eichel has an ambitious goal .
in four years time , he wants to present germany 's first balanced budget since 1970 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel on wednesday , eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- made some progress towards that goal , when the cabinet approved his draft budget for 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's draft , spending will decrease by 0.5 percent to 246.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 234.5 billion -rrb- and new borrowing will be cut from 21 billion euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- this year to 15.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.75 billion -rrb- in 2003 .
promises to balance the budget chancellor schröder 's government has made cutting spending one of its top priorities .
it does n't want to burden future generations with high interest payments on old debts .
in addition , schröder 's government narrowly avoided an eu warning about its high budget deficit in february .
last year , germany 's deficit rose to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
that 's dangerously close to the three percent eu limit that ensures the stability of the euro .
the german government was only able to avoid an embarrassing eu rebuke by promising to bring the country 's budget close to balance .
but economists and germany 's conservative opposition immediately criticized the finance minister 's pledge as unrealistic .
hans eichel 's reduced budget for 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless germans waiting at the employment office the biggest single item in eichel 's draft for 2003 is the labor minister 's budget .
it will increase by 1.3 percent in 2003 to 93.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 88.9 billion -rrb- because of germany 's high jobless rate .
around four million people are out of work in germany .
the finance minister 's draft is based on the assumption that the number of unemployed will go down to 3.8 million next year .
more people working would mean more people paying taxes , and therefore higher revenues and less spending on unemployment .
the second biggest chunk of the budget – though considerably smaller than that of the labor ministry - will go to the federal ministry of transport , building and housing .
at 26.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- , it remains roughly unchanged from this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german recruits the defense budget is the third-biggest item of the draft .
it 's set to increase in by 3.3 percent in 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's planning , the defense minister will have 23.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 23.2 billion -rrb- to spend next year .
government approves 2003 draft budget on wednesday , eichel had no problems getting the other government ministers to approve his draft budget for 2003 .
however this was only one small step on a long rocky road for eichel .
the draft still has to be approved by parliament , which is set to debate the budget plan after the september elections .
by then , eichel may no longer be in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber recent polls show schröder 's government coalition trailing behind his conservative opponent edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- .
germany 's conservative opposition has already made clear that it will thoroughly rework hans eichel 's budget plan in case of an election victory .
opposition is critical the conservatives criticized that eichel 's draft budget was based on wrong assumptions .
dietrich austermann , a budget expert with the christian democrats , said it was risky to assume gdp would grow by 2.5 percent .
if it failed to reach that target , important cornerstones of the budget would not be met .
austermann said that if the conservatives win the september election , they will cut spending even more .
they want to introduce more flexibility in the german labor market and they plan to reform the country 's pensions system .
austermann also announced the conservatives would save money by cutting back subsidies for what he called " pet projects " of the present government – ecological farming for instance .
but some economists say the conservatives ' plans for reforming the country 's finances are just as vague as those of the present government .
stoiber , the opposition candidate for chancellor , announced ambitious economic plans and projects a few weeks ago .
when journalists asked how he would finance them , however , stoiber 's answer was simply through the economic upswing that his government would bring about . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germany ca n't fund eu expansion the chancellor says germany will be unable to bring its household budget in order while at the same time providing agricultural subsidies to the eu 's eastern european accession states .

but opinion polls indicate that schröder may no longer be in power when it goes into effect . german finance minister hans eichel has an ambitious goal .
in four years time , he wants to present germany 's first balanced budget since 1970 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel on wednesday , eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- made some progress towards that goal , when the cabinet approved his draft budget for 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's draft , spending will decrease by 0.5 percent to 246.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 234.5 billion -rrb- and new borrowing will be cut from 21 billion euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- this year to 15.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.75 billion -rrb- in 2003 .
promises to balance the budget chancellor schröder 's government has made cutting spending one of its top priorities .
it does n't want to burden future generations with high interest payments on old debts .
in addition , schröder 's government narrowly avoided an eu warning about its high budget deficit in february .
last year , germany 's deficit rose to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
that 's dangerously close to the three percent eu limit that ensures the stability of the euro .
the german government was only able to avoid an embarrassing eu rebuke by promising to bring the country 's budget close to balance .
but economists and germany 's conservative opposition immediately criticized the finance minister 's pledge as unrealistic .
hans eichel 's reduced budget for 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless germans waiting at the employment office the biggest single item in eichel 's draft for 2003 is the labor minister 's budget .
it will increase by 1.3 percent in 2003 to 93.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 88.9 billion -rrb- because of germany 's high jobless rate .
around four million people are out of work in germany .
the finance minister 's draft is based on the assumption that the number of unemployed will go down to 3.8 million next year .
more people working would mean more people paying taxes , and therefore higher revenues and less spending on unemployment .
the second biggest chunk of the budget – though considerably smaller than that of the labor ministry - will go to the federal ministry of transport , building and housing .
at 26.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- , it remains roughly unchanged from this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german recruits the defense budget is the third-biggest item of the draft .
it 's set to increase in by 3.3 percent in 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's planning , the defense minister will have 23.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 23.2 billion -rrb- to spend next year .
government approves 2003 draft budget on wednesday , eichel had no problems getting the other government ministers to approve his draft budget for 2003 .
however this was only one small step on a long rocky road for eichel .
the draft still has to be approved by parliament , which is set to debate the budget plan after the september elections .
by then , eichel may no longer be in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber recent polls show schröder 's government coalition trailing behind his conservative opponent edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- .
germany 's conservative opposition has already made clear that it will thoroughly rework hans eichel 's budget plan in case of an election victory .
opposition is critical the conservatives criticized that eichel 's draft budget was based on wrong assumptions .
dietrich austermann , a budget expert with the christian democrats , said it was risky to assume gdp would grow by 2.5 percent .
if it failed to reach that target , important cornerstones of the budget would not be met .
austermann said that if the conservatives win the september election , they will cut spending even more .
they want to introduce more flexibility in the german labor market and they plan to reform the country 's pensions system .
austermann also announced the conservatives would save money by cutting back subsidies for what he called " pet projects " of the present government – ecological farming for instance .
but some economists say the conservatives ' plans for reforming the country 's finances are just as vague as those of the present government .
stoiber , the opposition candidate for chancellor , announced ambitious economic plans and projects a few weeks ago .

but opinion polls indicate that schröder may no longer be in power when it goes into effect . german finance minister hans eichel has an ambitious goal .
in four years time , he wants to present germany 's first balanced budget since 1970 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel on wednesday , eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- made some progress towards that goal , when the cabinet approved his draft budget for 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's draft , spending will decrease by 0.5 percent to 246.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 234.5 billion -rrb- and new borrowing will be cut from 21 billion euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- this year to 15.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.75 billion -rrb- in 2003 .
promises to balance the budget chancellor schröder 's government has made cutting spending one of its top priorities .
it does n't want to burden future generations with high interest payments on old debts .
in addition , schröder 's government narrowly avoided an eu warning about its high budget deficit in february .
last year , germany 's deficit rose to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
that 's dangerously close to the three percent eu limit that ensures the stability of the euro .
the german government was only able to avoid an embarrassing eu rebuke by promising to bring the country 's budget close to balance .
but economists and germany 's conservative opposition immediately criticized the finance minister 's pledge as unrealistic .
hans eichel 's reduced budget for 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless germans waiting at the employment office the biggest single item in eichel 's draft for 2003 is the labor minister 's budget .
it will increase by 1.3 percent in 2003 to 93.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 88.9 billion -rrb- because of germany 's high jobless rate .
around four million people are out of work in germany .
the finance minister 's draft is based on the assumption that the number of unemployed will go down to 3.8 million next year .
more people working would mean more people paying taxes , and therefore higher revenues and less spending on unemployment .
the second biggest chunk of the budget – though considerably smaller than that of the labor ministry - will go to the federal ministry of transport , building and housing .
at 26.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- , it remains roughly unchanged from this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german recruits the defense budget is the third-biggest item of the draft .
it 's set to increase in by 3.3 percent in 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's planning , the defense minister will have 23.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 23.2 billion -rrb- to spend next year .
government approves 2003 draft budget on wednesday , eichel had no problems getting the other government ministers to approve his draft budget for 2003 .
however this was only one small step on a long rocky road for eichel .
the draft still has to be approved by parliament , which is set to debate the budget plan after the september elections .
by then , eichel may no longer be in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber recent polls show schröder 's government coalition trailing behind his conservative opponent edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- .
germany 's conservative opposition has already made clear that it will thoroughly rework hans eichel 's budget plan in case of an election victory .
opposition is critical the conservatives criticized that eichel 's draft budget was based on wrong assumptions .
dietrich austermann , a budget expert with the christian democrats , said it was risky to assume gdp would grow by 2.5 percent .
if it failed to reach that target , important cornerstones of the budget would not be met .
austermann said that if the conservatives win the september election , they will cut spending even more .
they want to introduce more flexibility in the german labor market and they plan to reform the country 's pensions system .
austermann also announced the conservatives would save money by cutting back subsidies for what he called " pet projects " of the present government – ecological farming for instance .
but some economists say the conservatives ' plans for reforming the country 's finances are just as vague as those of the present government .
stoiber , the opposition candidate for chancellor , announced ambitious economic plans and projects a few weeks ago .
when journalists asked how he would finance them , however , stoiber 's answer was simply through the economic upswing that his government would bring about . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germany ca n't fund eu expansion the chancellor says germany will be unable to bring its household budget in order while at the same time providing agricultural subsidies to the eu 's eastern european accession states .

but opinion polls indicate that schröder may no longer be in power when it goes into effect . german finance minister hans eichel has an ambitious goal .
in four years time , he wants to present germany 's first balanced budget since 1970 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel on wednesday , eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- made some progress towards that goal , when the cabinet approved his draft budget for 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's draft , spending will decrease by 0.5 percent to 246.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 234.5 billion -rrb- and new borrowing will be cut from 21 billion euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- this year to 15.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.75 billion -rrb- in 2003 .
promises to balance the budget chancellor schröder 's government has made cutting spending one of its top priorities .
it does n't want to burden future generations with high interest payments on old debts .
in addition , schröder 's government narrowly avoided an eu warning about its high budget deficit in february .
last year , germany 's deficit rose to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
that 's dangerously close to the three percent eu limit that ensures the stability of the euro .
the german government was only able to avoid an embarrassing eu rebuke by promising to bring the country 's budget close to balance .
but economists and germany 's conservative opposition immediately criticized the finance minister 's pledge as unrealistic .
hans eichel 's reduced budget for 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless germans waiting at the employment office the biggest single item in eichel 's draft for 2003 is the labor minister 's budget .
it will increase by 1.3 percent in 2003 to 93.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 88.9 billion -rrb- because of germany 's high jobless rate .
around four million people are out of work in germany .
the finance minister 's draft is based on the assumption that the number of unemployed will go down to 3.8 million next year .
more people working would mean more people paying taxes , and therefore higher revenues and less spending on unemployment .
the second biggest chunk of the budget – though considerably smaller than that of the labor ministry - will go to the federal ministry of transport , building and housing .
at 26.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- , it remains roughly unchanged from this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german recruits the defense budget is the third-biggest item of the draft .
it 's set to increase in by 3.3 percent in 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's planning , the defense minister will have 23.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 23.2 billion -rrb- to spend next year .
government approves 2003 draft budget on wednesday , eichel had no problems getting the other government ministers to approve his draft budget for 2003 .
however this was only one small step on a long rocky road for eichel .
the draft still has to be approved by parliament , which is set to debate the budget plan after the september elections .
by then , eichel may no longer be in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber recent polls show schröder 's government coalition trailing behind his conservative opponent edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- .
germany 's conservative opposition has already made clear that it will thoroughly rework hans eichel 's budget plan in case of an election victory .
opposition is critical the conservatives criticized that eichel 's draft budget was based on wrong assumptions .
dietrich austermann , a budget expert with the christian democrats , said it was risky to assume gdp would grow by 2.5 percent .
if it failed to reach that target , important cornerstones of the budget would not be met .
austermann said that if the conservatives win the september election , they will cut spending even more .
they want to introduce more flexibility in the german labor market and they plan to reform the country 's pensions system .
austermann also announced the conservatives would save money by cutting back subsidies for what he called " pet projects " of the present government – ecological farming for instance .
but some economists say the conservatives ' plans for reforming the country 's finances are just as vague as those of the present government .
stoiber , the opposition candidate for chancellor , announced ambitious economic plans and projects a few weeks ago .

but opinion polls indicate that schröder may no longer be in power when it goes into effect . german finance minister hans eichel has an ambitious goal .
in four years time , he wants to present germany 's first balanced budget since 1970 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel on wednesday , eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- made some progress towards that goal , when the cabinet approved his draft budget for 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's draft , spending will decrease by 0.5 percent to 246.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 234.5 billion -rrb- and new borrowing will be cut from 21 billion euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- this year to 15.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.75 billion -rrb- in 2003 .
promises to balance the budget chancellor schröder 's government has made cutting spending one of its top priorities .
it does n't want to burden future generations with high interest payments on old debts .
in addition , schröder 's government narrowly avoided an eu warning about its high budget deficit in february .
last year , germany 's deficit rose to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
that 's dangerously close to the three percent eu limit that ensures the stability of the euro .
the german government was only able to avoid an embarrassing eu rebuke by promising to bring the country 's budget close to balance .
but economists and germany 's conservative opposition immediately criticized the finance minister 's pledge as unrealistic .
hans eichel 's reduced budget for 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless germans waiting at the employment office the biggest single item in eichel 's draft for 2003 is the labor minister 's budget .
it will increase by 1.3 percent in 2003 to 93.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 88.9 billion -rrb- because of germany 's high jobless rate .
around four million people are out of work in germany .
the finance minister 's draft is based on the assumption that the number of unemployed will go down to 3.8 million next year .
more people working would mean more people paying taxes , and therefore higher revenues and less spending on unemployment .
the second biggest chunk of the budget – though considerably smaller than that of the labor ministry - will go to the federal ministry of transport , building and housing .
at 26.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- , it remains roughly unchanged from this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german recruits the defense budget is the third-biggest item of the draft .
it 's set to increase in by 3.3 percent in 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's planning , the defense minister will have 23.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 23.2 billion -rrb- to spend next year .
government approves 2003 draft budget on wednesday , eichel had no problems getting the other government ministers to approve his draft budget for 2003 .
however this was only one small step on a long rocky road for eichel .
the draft still has to be approved by parliament , which is set to debate the budget plan after the september elections .
by then , eichel may no longer be in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber recent polls show schröder 's government coalition trailing behind his conservative opponent edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- .
germany 's conservative opposition has already made clear that it will thoroughly rework hans eichel 's budget plan in case of an election victory .
opposition is critical the conservatives criticized that eichel 's draft budget was based on wrong assumptions .
dietrich austermann , a budget expert with the christian democrats , said it was risky to assume gdp would grow by 2.5 percent .
if it failed to reach that target , important cornerstones of the budget would not be met .
austermann said that if the conservatives win the september election , they will cut spending even more .
they want to introduce more flexibility in the german labor market and they plan to reform the country 's pensions system .
austermann also announced the conservatives would save money by cutting back subsidies for what he called " pet projects " of the present government – ecological farming for instance .
but some economists say the conservatives ' plans for reforming the country 's finances are just as vague as those of the present government .
stoiber , the opposition candidate for chancellor , announced ambitious economic plans and projects a few weeks ago .
when journalists asked how he would finance them , however , stoiber 's answer was simply through the economic upswing that his government would bring about . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germany ca n't fund eu expansion the chancellor says germany will be unable to bring its household budget in order while at the same time providing agricultural subsidies to the eu 's eastern european accession states .

but opinion polls indicate that schröder may no longer be in power when it goes into effect . german finance minister hans eichel has an ambitious goal .
in four years time , he wants to present germany 's first balanced budget since 1970 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel on wednesday , eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- made some progress towards that goal , when the cabinet approved his draft budget for 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's draft , spending will decrease by 0.5 percent to 246.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 234.5 billion -rrb- and new borrowing will be cut from 21 billion euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- this year to 15.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.75 billion -rrb- in 2003 .
promises to balance the budget chancellor schröder 's government has made cutting spending one of its top priorities .
it does n't want to burden future generations with high interest payments on old debts .
in addition , schröder 's government narrowly avoided an eu warning about its high budget deficit in february .
last year , germany 's deficit rose to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
that 's dangerously close to the three percent eu limit that ensures the stability of the euro .
the german government was only able to avoid an embarrassing eu rebuke by promising to bring the country 's budget close to balance .
but economists and germany 's conservative opposition immediately criticized the finance minister 's pledge as unrealistic .
hans eichel 's reduced budget for 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless germans waiting at the employment office the biggest single item in eichel 's draft for 2003 is the labor minister 's budget .
it will increase by 1.3 percent in 2003 to 93.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 88.9 billion -rrb- because of germany 's high jobless rate .
around four million people are out of work in germany .
the finance minister 's draft is based on the assumption that the number of unemployed will go down to 3.8 million next year .
more people working would mean more people paying taxes , and therefore higher revenues and less spending on unemployment .
the second biggest chunk of the budget – though considerably smaller than that of the labor ministry - will go to the federal ministry of transport , building and housing .
at 26.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- , it remains roughly unchanged from this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german recruits the defense budget is the third-biggest item of the draft .
it 's set to increase in by 3.3 percent in 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's planning , the defense minister will have 23.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 23.2 billion -rrb- to spend next year .
government approves 2003 draft budget on wednesday , eichel had no problems getting the other government ministers to approve his draft budget for 2003 .
however this was only one small step on a long rocky road for eichel .
the draft still has to be approved by parliament , which is set to debate the budget plan after the september elections .
by then , eichel may no longer be in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber recent polls show schröder 's government coalition trailing behind his conservative opponent edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- .
germany 's conservative opposition has already made clear that it will thoroughly rework hans eichel 's budget plan in case of an election victory .
opposition is critical the conservatives criticized that eichel 's draft budget was based on wrong assumptions .
dietrich austermann , a budget expert with the christian democrats , said it was risky to assume gdp would grow by 2.5 percent .
if it failed to reach that target , important cornerstones of the budget would not be met .
austermann said that if the conservatives win the september election , they will cut spending even more .
they want to introduce more flexibility in the german labor market and they plan to reform the country 's pensions system .
austermann also announced the conservatives would save money by cutting back subsidies for what he called " pet projects " of the present government – ecological farming for instance .
but some economists say the conservatives ' plans for reforming the country 's finances are just as vague as those of the present government .
stoiber , the opposition candidate for chancellor , announced ambitious economic plans and projects a few weeks ago .
when journalists asked how he would finance them , however , stoiber 's answer was simply through the economic upswing that his government would bring about . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germany ca n't fund eu expansion the chancellor says germany will be unable to bring its household budget in order while at the same time providing agricultural subsidies to the eu 's eastern european accession states .

but opinion polls indicate that schröder may no longer be in power when it goes into effect . german finance minister hans eichel has an ambitious goal .
in four years time , he wants to present germany 's first balanced budget since 1970 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel on wednesday , eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- made some progress towards that goal , when the cabinet approved his draft budget for 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's draft , spending will decrease by 0.5 percent to 246.3 billion euro -lrb- $ 234.5 billion -rrb- and new borrowing will be cut from 21 billion euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- this year to 15.5 billion euro -lrb- $ 14.75 billion -rrb- in 2003 .
promises to balance the budget chancellor schröder 's government has made cutting spending one of its top priorities .
it does n't want to burden future generations with high interest payments on old debts .
in addition , schröder 's government narrowly avoided an eu warning about its high budget deficit in february .
last year , germany 's deficit rose to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
that 's dangerously close to the three percent eu limit that ensures the stability of the euro .
the german government was only able to avoid an embarrassing eu rebuke by promising to bring the country 's budget close to balance .
but economists and germany 's conservative opposition immediately criticized the finance minister 's pledge as unrealistic .
hans eichel 's reduced budget for 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobless germans waiting at the employment office the biggest single item in eichel 's draft for 2003 is the labor minister 's budget .
it will increase by 1.3 percent in 2003 to 93.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 88.9 billion -rrb- because of germany 's high jobless rate .
around four million people are out of work in germany .
the finance minister 's draft is based on the assumption that the number of unemployed will go down to 3.8 million next year .
more people working would mean more people paying taxes , and therefore higher revenues and less spending on unemployment .
the second biggest chunk of the budget – though considerably smaller than that of the labor ministry - will go to the federal ministry of transport , building and housing .
at 26.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 25 billion -rrb- , it remains roughly unchanged from this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german recruits the defense budget is the third-biggest item of the draft .
it 's set to increase in by 3.3 percent in 2003 .
according to the finance minister 's planning , the defense minister will have 23.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 23.2 billion -rrb- to spend next year .
government approves 2003 draft budget on wednesday , eichel had no problems getting the other government ministers to approve his draft budget for 2003 .
however this was only one small step on a long rocky road for eichel .
the draft still has to be approved by parliament , which is set to debate the budget plan after the september elections .
by then , eichel may no longer be in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber recent polls show schröder 's government coalition trailing behind his conservative opponent edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- .
germany 's conservative opposition has already made clear that it will thoroughly rework hans eichel 's budget plan in case of an election victory .
opposition is critical the conservatives criticized that eichel 's draft budget was based on wrong assumptions .
dietrich austermann , a budget expert with the christian democrats , said it was risky to assume gdp would grow by 2.5 percent .
if it failed to reach that target , important cornerstones of the budget would not be met .
austermann said that if the conservatives win the september election , they will cut spending even more .
they want to introduce more flexibility in the german labor market and they plan to reform the country 's pensions system .
austermann also announced the conservatives would save money by cutting back subsidies for what he called " pet projects " of the present government – ecological farming for instance .
but some economists say the conservatives ' plans for reforming the country 's finances are just as vague as those of the present government .
stoiber , the opposition candidate for chancellor , announced ambitious economic plans and projects a few weeks ago .
when journalists asked how he would finance them , however , stoiber 's answer was simply through the economic upswing that his government would bring about . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder says germany ca n't fund eu expansion the chancellor says germany will be unable to bring its household budget in order while at the same time providing agricultural subsidies to the eu 's eastern european accession states .
-lrb- june 17 , 2002 -rrb- it ’ s the labor market , stupid an upswing is in sight , but not for germany .
the country will lag behind its european neighbors , say economists , as long as the government refuses to tackle its biggest culprit : the labor market .
-lrb- april 25 , 2002 -rrb- germany , short on cash ?
there will be less money pouring into germany ’ s state coffers from tax revenues this year - at least € 4.6 billion less .
the weak economy is to blame , says the government , and crosses its fingers for a recovery .

anti-drugs campaigners in rhyl want an apology after david a 'herne , wales ' so called crime czar , was quoted as saying that he would n't " go to rhyl without steel boots " in case he " stepped on hypodermic needles " .
chief constable richard brunstrom says rhyl needs extra effort mr a 'herne maintains his comments were taken out of context and , in a statement , said drugs misuse in wales needs to be tackled by a partnership approach .
in march this year , uk home secretary david blunkett named a section of the town as one of uk 's five crime hotspots .
rhyl 's link with drugs culture has been in the spotlight in recent weeks after a businessman announced plans to open a dutch-style cannabis cafe in the town .
the chief constable of north wales police , richard brunstrom , had already opened up the issue with his call for a new debate on the country 's policies on tackling illegal drugs .
however , mr brunstrom has vowed to close down the proposed cannabis cafe even though this month has seen north wales police drugs squad officers travel to amsterdam to find out how their dutch counterparts deal with the issue of drugs possession .
needles can be found near rhyl 's seafront it is against this background that mr a 'herne , a former chief superintendent with south wales police , made his " steel boots " comment during an assembly committee meeting .
his remarks have been supported by some of those who work on rhyl 's seafront , who have said the drug takers are a nuisance .
shopkeeper , dave jones , said : " they are coming and pinching from the shops .
that 's paying for their habits . "
but his comment runs against the ideas of some of those trying to improve the town 's image .
rhyl west councillor joan butterfield said : " rhyl is a nice place to live - we do have problems but so has every other town within the principality . "
the bishop of st asaph has publicly defended the seaside resort , warning its label as a crime hotspot could " stigmatise " the town .

a man identified as a loyalist killer tells the programme - to be broadcast on wednesday - that the targets included the lawyer , pat finucane , who was murdered 13 years ago .
mr finucane was a thorn in the side of the british establishment in northern ireland until the sunday evening in 1989 when loyalist gunmen burst into his home and shot him dead in front of his wife and children .
as panorama reveals , the story of who killed him and why continues to haunt the authorities in belfast and london .
it also raises disturbing questions about collusion between elements of the security forces and loyalist murder gangs .
the central charge in the programme is that such collusion resulted in the murder of a number of innocent catholics - among them mr finucane .
in one extraordinary moment , reporter john ware sits in a car with ken barrett , a loyalist paramilitary who is unaware that this meeting and others are being secretly filmed and recorded .
pat finucane : allegations of collusion surround murder barrett tells ware bluntly : " finucane would have been alive today if the peelers -lrb- police -rrb- had n't interfered . "
barrett - described in the programme by a veteran detective as " a killer " - says a special branch officer encouraged loyalists to murder pat finucane .
they then tipped off the assassination squad on the fatal night that the coast around his house was clear - in other words that there were no police or army patrols around it .
it is shocking stuff , but the programme suggests it is part of a pattern , and that at the centre of that pattern were paramilitaries like ken barrett , but also the still more sinister figure of brian nelson .
' more professional ' nelson was a former soldier from northern ireland recruited by military intelligence and sent back to belfast to infiltrate the loyalist paramilitary organisation the ulster defence association -lrb- uda -rrb- .
in partnership with his handlers though , his job rapidly and dangerously expanded until he was supplying loyalist killers with intelligence documents from the security forces .
sir john says he never believed that story and makes it plain he believes the shadowy forces he was investigating were out to stop him the aim , according to the programme , was to make the targeting by loyalists " more professional " .
the result was that innocent catholics were killed .
since 1989 , sir john stevens , who is now commissioner of the metropolitan police , has been investigating the allegation that shadowy elements within military intelligence and the ruc special branch were colluding with loyalist assassination squads .
duplicate office the obstruction he has faced was most dramatically illustrated by the fire which destroyed the offices in which officers working for him were based , in a police station near carrickfergus , county antrim , in 1990 .
there was a story the fire had been caused by a discarded cigarette end .

a man identified as a loyalist killer tells the programme - to be broadcast on wednesday - that the targets included the lawyer , pat finucane , who was murdered 13 years ago .
mr finucane was a thorn in the side of the british establishment in northern ireland until the sunday evening in 1989 when loyalist gunmen burst into his home and shot him dead in front of his wife and children .
as panorama reveals , the story of who killed him and why continues to haunt the authorities in belfast and london .
it also raises disturbing questions about collusion between elements of the security forces and loyalist murder gangs .
the central charge in the programme is that such collusion resulted in the murder of a number of innocent catholics - among them mr finucane .
in one extraordinary moment , reporter john ware sits in a car with ken barrett , a loyalist paramilitary who is unaware that this meeting and others are being secretly filmed and recorded .
barrett tells ware bluntly : " finucane would have been alive today if the peelers -lrb- police -rrb- had n't interfered . "
barrett - described in the programme by a veteran detective as " a killer " - says a special branch officer encouraged loyalists to murder pat finucane .
they then tipped off the assassination squad on the fatal night that the coast around his house was clear - in other words that there were no police or army patrols around it .
it is shocking stuff , but the programme suggests it is part of a pattern , and that at the centre of that pattern were paramilitaries like ken barrett , but also the still more sinister figure of brian nelson .
' more professional ' nelson was a former soldier from northern ireland recruited by military intelligence and sent back to belfast to infiltrate the loyalist paramilitary organisation the ulster defence association -lrb- uda -rrb- .
in partnership with his handlers though , his job rapidly and dangerously expanded until he was supplying loyalist killers with intelligence documents from the security forces . "
sir john says he never believed that story and makes it plain he believes the shadowy forces he was investigating were out to stop him " the aim , according to the programme , was to make the targeting by loyalists " more professional " .
the result was that innocent catholics were killed .
since 1989 , sir john stevens , who is now commissioner of the metropolitan police , has been investigating the allegation that shadowy elements within military intelligence and the ruc special branch were colluding with loyalist assassination squads .
duplicate office the obstruction he has faced was most dramatically illustrated by the fire which destroyed the offices in which officers working for him were based , in a police station near carrickfergus , county antrim , in 1990 .
there was a story the fire had been caused by a discarded cigarette end .
but in the panorama programme , sir john says he never believed that story and makes it plain he believes the shadowy forces he was investigating were out to stop him . "
panorama has shed light on a murky and dangerous world , and will tell a british audience one dark aspect of what was undertaken in their name " " what happened was , round about the second or third day of that inquiry , we were given some notification that something might well happen .
" that 's the reason why we had a duplicate office in cambridgeshire where we had statements which made sure that when the fire took place we could continue with the inquiry . "
the stevens report is due out soon , but this panorama report - with detectives who worked on the inquiry helping to paint a picture of this murky world of collusion and bereaved catholic families telling of its human cost - seems to point to the conclusions it will reach .

kim hong-up appeared for questioning at the supreme prosecutor 's office which was packed with reporters .
president kim 's younger son is already in jail the 52-year-old , a former head of the non-profit making organisation the kim dae-jung peace foundation , denies any link with alleged money-laundering .
earlier this month , another of the president 's sons , his youngest , kim hong-gul , was charged with influence-peddling and tax evasion .
he is in jail awaiting trial .
the scandals are being blamed as a major factor for the governing millennium democratic party 's crushing defeat in local elections last week .
president kim is constitutionally barred from standing for a second term in december 's presidential elections .
but his party 's presidential candidate , roh moo-hyun , will have to work harder to distance himself from the president and his entourage if he is to have a fighting chance of victory .
president kim , a nobel peace prize winner , has not personally been accused of any wrongdoing in any of the cases , but the investigation has dented his image .

the festival bill has been kept secret but has not prevented tickets selling out early .
now organisers have revealed their line-up for the three-day somerset rock festival .
veteran stewart and former pink floyd member waters find themselves on the bill with younger talent such as ash and the white stripes .
this year 's festival is the first for two years , with security at an all time high to prevent fence-jumping .
organisers have warned that large numbers trying to gatecrash the event without paying could lead to its eventual demise .
founder michael eavis has spent £ 1m on a 12ft-high " super fence " but many locals are worried about what will happen if ticketless fans are turned away .
leading acts this year 's crowd of 100,000 paying festivalgoers and 40,000 others will be the biggest official crowd for some years .
as well as a host of leading rock acts , chillout bands such as groove armada and air and uk r & b act mis-teeq are also on the bill .
friday 's line-up will feature coldplay , faithless , ash , nelly furtado , doves , the dandy warhols , bush , alabama 3 , spiritualized , garbage , and mercury rev. on saturday festivalgoers will see mystery guests as well as the charlatans , the white stripes , starsailor , ian brown , no doubt , jools holland , orbital , mis-teeq , and kosheen .
and the last day of the festival will include rod stewart , roger waters , isaac hayes , badly drawn boy , rolf harris , air , groove armada , and belle and sebastian .
but those at the festival are set to miss the world cup final - held on the final sunday .
" we are not going to be showing it because we are about music and arts and that is neither , " a spokesman told the guardian newspaper .
the three-day festival runs from friday 28 june to sunday 30 june .
