after months of talks with the united states , the european commission has condemned the duties as " illegal " and is seeking to refer the case to the world trade organisation .
europe prepares for action as discussions fail with no amicable solution in sight , the spokeswoman for eu trade commissioner pascal lamy told the bbc , " we are not going to sit and wait . "

the european commission values leu exports at 506.8 million euro -lrb- $ 500m -rrb- - or one third of the u.s. market the current dispute over uranium follows spats between the u.s. and europe over corporate tax breaks and trade in steel , bananas and beef .
two years ago , the u.s. enrichment corporation -lrb- usec -rrb- , the only enricher of uranium in the united states , lodged a complaint against the french government 's eurodif and urenco , a british-dutch-german government consortium , complaining of unfair subsidies .
this was followed by an investigation by the international trade commission -lrb- itc -rrb- , which recommended the imposition of duties .
the subsequent report stated that ' subsidised ' european leu was harming the domestic industry in the united states .
threat to u.s. industry prompted extra duties for europe as a result , eurodif now pays an extra 34 per cent duty , and urenco 2.23 per cent , on exports to the u.s. the european commission estimates usec will receive about 101.3 million euro -lrb- $ 100m -rrb- in extra annual income from the duties .
urenco disputes the findings and plans to appeal to the u.s. court of international trade .
the itc also found state-owned power company electricite de france -lrb- edf -rrb- had bought eurodif 's uranium at about 13 per cent above market prices , and that the proceeds were then used to bankroll the sale of uranium in the united states at 19.5 per cent below usec prices .
usec has a monopoly on uranium enrichment in america and is the world 's leading supplier of fuel to nuclear power plants .
the company is also the only middleman for recycling weapons grade material from decommissioned russian nuclear warheads .
the u.s. government hopes the deal will keep the material out of terrorist hands .
urenco plans to break up usec monopoly in america however , usec could soon face domestic competition from urenco , which reputedly produces the cheapest enriched uranium in the world , has the newest technology and is expanding capacity rapidly .
it is part of a consortium that plans to build a 1.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.1bn -rrb- uranium processing plant in the u.s. , the first since the 1980s , which would break usec 's monopoly .

after months of talks with the united states , the european commission has condemned the duties as " illegal " and is seeking to refer the case to the world trade organisation .

after months of talks with the united states , the european commission has condemned the duties as " illegal " and is seeking to refer the case to the world trade organisation .
europe prepares for action as discussions fail with no amicable solution in sight , the spokeswoman for eu trade commissioner pascal lamy told the bbc , " we are not going to sit and wait . "
" we will send our final consultation documentation to our member states in the next couple of weeks and do not expect any obstacles . "
the european commission values leu exports at 506.8 million euro -lrb- $ 500m -rrb- - or one third of the u.s. market the current dispute over uranium follows spats between the u.s. and europe over corporate tax breaks and trade in steel , bananas and beef .
two years ago , the u.s. enrichment corporation -lrb- usec -rrb- , the only enricher of uranium in the united states , lodged a complaint against the french government 's eurodif and urenco , a british-dutch-german government consortium , complaining of unfair subsidies .
this was followed by an investigation by the international trade commission -lrb- itc -rrb- , which recommended the imposition of duties .
the subsequent report stated that ' subsidised ' european leu was harming the domestic industry in the united states .
threat to u.s. industry prompted extra duties for europe as a result , eurodif now pays an extra 34 per cent duty , and urenco 2.23 per cent , on exports to the u.s. the european commission estimates usec will receive about 101.3 million euro -lrb- $ 100m -rrb- in extra annual income from the duties .
urenco disputes the findings and plans to appeal to the u.s. court of international trade .
the itc also found state-owned power company electricite de france -lrb- edf -rrb- had bought eurodif 's uranium at about 13 per cent above market prices , and that the proceeds were then used to bankroll the sale of uranium in the united states at 19.5 per cent below usec prices .
usec has a monopoly on uranium enrichment in america and is the world 's leading supplier of fuel to nuclear power plants .
the company is also the only middleman for recycling weapons grade material from decommissioned russian nuclear warheads .
the u.s. government hopes the deal will keep the material out of terrorist hands .
urenco plans to break up usec monopoly in america however , usec could soon face domestic competition from urenco , which reputedly produces the cheapest enriched uranium in the world , has the newest technology and is expanding capacity rapidly .
it is part of a consortium that plans to build a 1.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.1bn -rrb- uranium processing plant in the u.s. , the first since the 1980s , which would break usec 's monopoly .

europe prepares for action as discussions fail with no amicable solution in sight , the spokeswoman for eu trade commissioner pascal lamy told the bbc , " we are not going to sit and wait . "
" we will send our final consultation documentation to our member states in the next couple of weeks and do not expect any obstacles . "
the european commission values leu exports at 506.8 million euro -lrb- $ 500m -rrb- - or one third of the u.s. market the current dispute over uranium follows spats between the u.s. and europe over corporate tax breaks and trade in steel , bananas and beef .
two years ago , the u.s. enrichment corporation -lrb- usec -rrb- , the only enricher of uranium in the united states , lodged a complaint against the french government 's eurodif and urenco , a british-dutch-german government consortium , complaining of unfair subsidies .
this was followed by an investigation by the international trade commission -lrb- itc -rrb- , which recommended the imposition of duties .
the subsequent report stated that ' subsidised ' european leu was harming the domestic industry in the united states .
threat to u.s. industry prompted extra duties for europe as a result , eurodif now pays an extra 34 per cent duty , and urenco 2.23 per cent , on exports to the u.s. the european commission estimates usec will receive about 101.3 million euro -lrb- $ 100m -rrb- in extra annual income from the duties .
urenco disputes the findings and plans to appeal to the u.s. court of international trade .
the itc also found state-owned power company electricite de france -lrb- edf -rrb- had bought eurodif 's uranium at about 13 per cent above market prices , and that the proceeds were then used to bankroll the sale of uranium in the united states at 19.5 per cent below usec prices .
usec has a monopoly on uranium enrichment in america and is the world 's leading supplier of fuel to nuclear power plants .
the company is also the only middleman for recycling weapons grade material from decommissioned russian nuclear warheads .
the u.s. government hopes the deal will keep the material out of terrorist hands .
urenco plans to break up usec monopoly in america however , usec could soon face domestic competition from urenco , which reputedly produces the cheapest enriched uranium in the world , has the newest technology and is expanding capacity rapidly .
it is part of a consortium that plans to build a 1.1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.1bn -rrb- uranium processing plant in the u.s. , the first since the 1980s , which would break usec 's monopoly .
the output from the plant , which could be operational by 2007 , would not be subject to duties and would be significantly cheaper to operate . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de who has the last say in trade ?

this jury should have focused on what the plaintiff knew about the health risks of smoking philip morris lawyer philip morris said it would ask the californian court to order a new trial or - if that is denied - a reduction in the size of the award .
the award , the biggest ever in an individual smoking-related lawsuit , comes on top of an initial $ 850,000 payout intended to compensate the plaintiff - a 64-year-old woman suffering from lung cancer - for her illness .
the verdict wiped 6 % off philip morris ' share price , and dragged other tobacco stocks lower in sympathy .
the bbc 's patrick o 'connell says this suggests that investors are not yet as convinced as lawyers for philip morris that this award , and indeed the trial itself , can be overturned .
cover-up lawyers for the plaintiff argued in court that the tobacco giant had deliberately concealed evidence about the links between smoking and cancer .
but philip morris ' legal team said the company should not be blamed for her personal decision to keep on smoking .
" this jury should have focused on what the plaintiff knew about the health risks of smoking , and whether anything the company ever said or did improperly influenced her decision to smoke or not to quit , " said philip morris lawyer william ohlemeyer .
" testimony during the trial showed that ms bullock was aware of the health risks of smoking and was warned repeatedly of those risks by her doctors over four decades , and her daughter also urged her to quit , " he said .
the plaintiff , betty bullock , smoked from the age of 17 until she was diagnosed with cancer in february last year .
the disease has since spread to her liver .
it is estimated that she has just months to live .
record breaker the punitive damages bill dwarfs an earlier $ 3bn award set at a separate tobacco trial in june last year .
that award was later reduced to $ 100m .
philip morris has said that the award to ms bullock breaches us supreme court guidelines which limit punitive damages to four times the size of the compensatory damages .
if she were to receive the money , ms bullock would become one of the richest people in america . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's patrick o 'connell " a record punishment of $ 28 billion " counsel for philip morris william ohlemeyer " we 'll ask the trial judge to reduce this award " forest 's simon clark " if you go back to the second world war cigarettes were known as ' coffin nails " ' see also : 27 sep 02 -pipe- business giant cigarette firm feels pinch 10 aug 01 -pipe- business court cuts record tobacco damages 07 jun 01 -pipe- americas us smoker wins billions in damages 17 jul 01 -pipe- business philip morris : tobacco and food giant 17 jul 01 -pipe- americas fury over ' benefits of smoking ' report 07 jun 01 -pipe- business tobacco ' tailspin ' fears after jury ruling 07 jun 01 -pipe- business what now for big tobacco ? 07 jun 01 -pipe- business q & a : tobacco litigation internet links : philip morris the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : hacker breaches credit card security job losses escalate at reuters new sec chief pledges tough line oil prices push higher rwanda denies drc plundering overseas sales drive wal-mart congo 's finance minister resigns blair keeps euro options open links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

"
it 's clear that there has to be constant pressure to get the iraqis to comply " dr hans blix , un weapons inspections chief dr hans blix said there had been an " erosion " of the inspection regime and pressure needed to be put on iraq to comply with the un-mandated checks .
he was speaking after a meeting with us secretary of state colin powell and mohammed el-baradei , head of the international atomic energy agency which would be responsible for checking any nuclear programme in iraq .
the us has meanwhile been keeping up the pressure at home and internationally , as it seeks to win support for a fresh resolution on iraq .
cia dossier on iraq iraq tried to get material to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons biological weapons can be made at hard-to-detect mobile factories hundreds of tonnes of chemical weapons stockpiled missile-development programme continuing the director of the cia , george tenet , briefed us senators in a secret session on the situation in iraq and his agency released its own dossier backing the view that iraq has significant caches of illegal arms .
much of the declassified information covers areas already mentioned by a british report .
senators also urged mr tenet to release any evidence which contradicted the white house view that iraq was a threat .
correspondents say that a national address by president george w bush scheduled for monday is likely to be an attempt to win support from wavering politicians and public as well as the united nations .
draft resolution mr powell said the us continued to favour a single , strong new un resolution demanding action from iraq but acknowledged there were other views in the security council , which have been hardening against the us .
the americans have circulated a controversial draft resolution which carries a clear threat of military intervention if baghdad fails to comply with the mission of the weapons inspectors .
neither the us nor britain wants inspectors to return to iraq until a new resolution has been adopted .
dr blix had wanted to return to baghdad by the middle of this month , but acknowledged it would be awkward if his team received new instructions from the security council once they were in iraq .
" the security council resolution that is now being discussed is one that i think we would welcome , " he said .
" it 's clear that there has to be constant pressure to get the iraqis to comply , " he added .
us ' optimistic ' mr powell said he was optimistic that an agreement would be reached soon among the 15 members of the un security council .
us draft resolution for un a un member state can use " all necessary means " should baghdad not co-operate with inspectors any permanent member of the security council can join an inspection mission and recommend sites to be inspected inspectors can declare no-fly and no-drive exclusion zones anywhere in iraq access to all sites including presidential palaces " there has been , as dr blix said , an erosion of the inspection regime ... and we have to fix that , " he said .
but opposition to the us line on iraq has been hardening at the united nations , with russia and france rejecting the tough draft resolution .
russia 's president vladimir putin said on friday that un weapons inspectors had to go back to iraq " as soon as possible " .
the french have been pushing a two-phase set of resolutions - the first outlining the inspectors ' mission and the second , only if needed , detailing action to be taken against iraq .
and turkey , a key us military ally bordering iraq , said any us attack on iraq must have international backing .

she shares the doorways and street corner and whatever food she can beg with some other street children .

which child , i ask .
the two-year-old or the one she is expecting .
but the boy is so far gone from glue that he is making little sense .
the conversation drifts off into a tumble of mismatched sentences .
just then a man - i guess he was in his 50s - walked by .
cynthia immediately walked up to him .
she caressed him .
he took some money from his pocket and then , noticing that we were watching , put it back again .
they walked to the end of the street , out of sight .
but cynthia reappeared soon after .
nothing had happened , she said .
the american writer william styron once wrote of the " lost and broken children of the world . "
he meant , i think , those who lived in a world in which they were powerless , the numberless army of those without a voice .
there are 20,000 of these children in honduras - 150 million around the world .
they exist because so much of our world is a mess .
they live in countries where families can not feed their young ; where shacks are too small to house growing families ; where natural disasters like hurricanes and earthquakes have driven hundreds of thousands from their homes ; and where war and drought have reduced once prosperous nations to beggardom .

disappear them . "

as it happens they are not street children .
but the policemen who abduct them do n't believe this .
a few days later the boys ' bodies are found .
they have been savagely tortured .
their genitals have been cut off .
a few human rights groups make noise .
but the streets are not filled with vast protesting crowds .
there is no national uproar .
no government falls .
honduras is not alone in this degree of indifference .
in the minds of too many , street children equal crime equal social vermin ... to be eradicated .
some street children are involved in crime .
i have been robbed by them in nairobi .
i watched them pull a knife on a colleague in mongolia .
i have been harassed and annoyed by them and wished they would vanish from my sight .
getting tough on crime sitting at traffic lights i have averted my gaze from their outstretched hands .
go away .
you frighten me .
you make me feel guilty .
what do you expect me to do about you ?
which , of course , is how society responds .
but i still struggle to understand how a policeman or vigilante makes the journey to pulling the trigger or wielding the knife that kills a child .
i have heard it explained that in countries like honduras and brazil where the military and police have a long history of being able to do as they wish ... that a culture of impunity also brutalises the police ... add to that pressure from politicians and the public to get tough on crime ... you end up with thousands of street children murdered .
it 's a large part of the explanation .
we know from all the wars of our time that men can kill children easily enough .
what is harder to explain is our collective human indifference .
the statistics are published every year ; the aid agencies appeal for help for these children and they call for legislation to protect them .
but the killing goes on and on .
we are not scandalised .
i can not explain our indifference .
is it simply that we are weary of these miseries ?
in tegucigalpa , the children have a disconcerting habit .
it pulls you to the heart of this matter - to what is needed and what is denied .
some of the smaller ones throw their arms around your waist and cling to you .
there is no aggression in the gesture .
it is only longing .
but you wonder how to respond .
if you follow your instinct and show affection will the child expect more ?
want to be rescued ?
but after a while standing there you realise they are not asking for anything at all .
they long ago passed the stage of expecting adults to deliver them from the streets .
all that is asked here is a gesture that recognises that they are human , not animal , not invisible .
which of course is nothing to ask - and everything .

the new government , expected to be from the centre-right , is likely to take the country into the european union , and possibly into nato .
with two parties in the outgoing coalition floundering in the polls , the race to come top in the election is between a third coalition party - the people 's party - and a brand new party , new era .
the latest poll suggests that these parties are neck and neck , each with roughly 14 % support .
the same poll suggests that the latvia 's way party of prime minister andris berzins , and the union for fatherland and freedom , one of its coalition partners , could struggle to cross the 5 % threshold for representation in parliament .
whizz kid the new era party is led by the former head of latvia 's central bank , einars repse , whose impressive performance is attributed to his personal charisma and reputation for honesty " before every election there is a tradition in latvia of some newcomer promising to deliver everything " prime minister andris berzins latvians know mr repse as a whizz kid who took over the central bank at the age of 30 and steered the country 's economy through the tricky post-soviet years .
he managed the replacement of the russian rouble by a stable national currency , the lat , that is seen as marking the beginning of latvia 's economic revival .
he stepped down from the bank 10 months ago , set up his party , and has topped almost all popularity polls since .
corruption analysts say it was discontent with the government , including accusations of corruption , that opened the political door for mr repse . "
this election is not about nato and the eu at all , but it should be " zaneta ozolina , latvian university latvia ranked 52nd out of 102 countries in a corruption index drawn up by the transparency international consultancy this year - putting it together with sri lanka , morocco , slovakia and the czech republic .
efforts to privatize the latvian shipping co . , one of the largest state-owned companies , have failed four times since 1995 and have led to the demise of two governments amid unproven allegations of bribery .
mr repse 's political rivals say they had to make unpopular decisions , while he was sheltered from the political storm in his office in the central bank .
" before every election there is a tradition in latvia of some newcomer promising to deliver everything , " says prime minister berzins .
high expectations two of the most important issues regarding latvia 's future - entry into nato and the european union - have not been major issues in the campaign , because all right-wing parties are in favour .
" this election is not about nato and the eu at all , but it should be as these are the all-important issues for latvia , and not the petty squabbles we 've seen in this campaign , " said zaneta ozolina , a politics professor at the latvian university .
latvia firmly expects an invitation to join nato at a summit in prague in november and to enter the european union in 2004 .
msot analysts expect the result to be a broad centre-right coalition with either mr repse or three-times premier andris skele - head of the people 's party - at the helm .
this would ensure reforms along western market lines are kept on track .

if you start doing things because you hate others and want to screw them over the end result is bad " linus torvalds talking to bbc world clickonline at his home in silicon valley , the inventor of the linux operating system admitted that he has never been in the same room with his arch-rival .
" we have been at the same conferences but never in the same room .

mr torvalds enjoys the notoriety he has achieved as the man that challenged the microsoft empire with his open source alternative operating system .
rising to the challenge " in a way it is fun .
i 'm pleased to be a poster boy .
it gives me some self-importance , " he said .
he would not , however , want to become personally involved in the dispute with microsoft .
" i 've tried to stay out of the microsoft debate .

people may hate windows but they run it despite that because , quite frankly , they do n't care about computers " linus torvalds the main reason he developed linux in the first place had as much to do with wanting a challenge as being fed up with an operating system that would not do what he wanted it to .
like most technology projects it ran way over the time allotted to it and , to this day , is not truly finished .
" it was a lot harder than i expected .
i thought , like most of my projects , it would talk half a year and then i 'd lose interest , " he said .
to the relief of his legion of followers he did persevere and eleven years on is still working on it .
reluctance to change while linux is gradually gaining ground on microsoft it might well not be suitable for everyone , mr torvalds admitted .
" most people do n't want to change .
they may hate windows but they run it despite that because , quite frankly , they do n't care about computers , " he said .
linux facts worth about $ 280m by 2006 cheaper than microsoft software source code is open for others to look and change ibm is one of its biggest fans and even those that do care , often install linux without much idea of what they want it to do , he said .
mr torvalds is not convinced that the open source movement , which has radically altered both the operating system landscape and the mindset of microsoft itself , will ever entirely topple the gates empire .
" i think , in the end , linux will be a big part of why it happens but microsoft is not going to shrink into nothingness in the foreseeable future , " he said .
instead it is more likely that microsoft will become like ibm - " still huge but not the dominant force anymore " , he said .

bullet fragments found at the scene of the sixth killing matched those from at least three of the five slayings initially blamed on the random shooter , authorities said .
police are hunting for a sniper and a driver accomplice .
the sixth victim - 72-year-old pascal charlot - was killed by a single shot while walking on a street corner in the us capital , close to its border with maryland .
he was shot at 2115 on thursday , nearly 12 hours after the 15-hour period when the other five shootings occurred , all with a five-mile -lrb- eight-kilometre -rrb- radius in maryland 's montgomery county .
three men and two women were shot and killed with high-velocity bullets in the separate incidents - two at petrol stations and one outside a post office in an affluent suburb of washington dc . "
you 've got a driver , you 've got a shooter " charles moose local police chief police said the victims were hit " from a distance , " probably with .223-calibre bullets from an assault or hunting rifle .
nearly 150 state troopers and federal agents - including the fbi and secret service - are investigating the case and the local authorities have offered a reward of $ 50,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction .
no obvious pattern the police believe the killings are linked , they are struggling to find any connection between them .
" there is not a lot of indication at this time that any of these individuals know each other , " said montgomery country police chief charles moose .
one victim was shot dead while riding a lawnmower , another while cleaning her car at a petrol station .
none of the six appeared to have been robbed .
police also said race did not seem to be a motive .
the victims were white , black , hispanic and a man from india .
" we 're across the board in genders and ethnic backgrounds , " police spokeswoman nancy demme said .
the ages of the victims ranged from to 25 to 72 .
ms demme gave more details of the killings : a 55-year-old man was the first to be killed , in a parking lot of a grocery store in wheaton on wednesday evening a man riding a lawnmower was killed at 0745 on thursday in the white flint area a taxi driver was shot dead while filling his car at a petrol station at 0815 in the aspen hill area at about 0845 a woman died after being shot in the head at a post office in silver spring a woman was shot dead at a shell petrol station in kensington a man was shot in the chest as he walked in washington dc ' one or more ' police said they were searching for a white van with black lettering , possibly with some damage to the rear , which was spotted speeding from the scene of the post office shooting .
a witness saw two people inside the vehicle , the number of which has not been traced .
the shootings , which took place in one of the country 's wealthiest counties , spread terror across washington dc and its suburbs .
