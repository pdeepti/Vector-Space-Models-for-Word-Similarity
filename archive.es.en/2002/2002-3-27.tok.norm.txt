the initiative will change the way in which cervical cell samples are handled .
the aim is to see a dramatic reduction in the number of inconclusive results .
smear tests have helped to reduce the rate of cervical cancer , which is now rare in the uk because of the success of screening and treatment programmes .
malcolm chisholm is spending £ 3m however , some cell samples can be damaged on the way to the laboratory , leading to inconclusive results .
some 24,000 women are required to repeat the test each year in scotland , and more than 3,000 are referred for unnecessary treatment .
health minister malcolm chisholm is spending almost £ 3m to overhaul the system .
the test itself will not change - but the cell samples taken from patients will now be placed in preservative fluid .
that should protect the samples and lead to faster and more accurate readings .
the expansion of the initiative follows pilot schemes at hospitals in inverness , aberdeen , dundee and lanarkshire .
the new procedure is not yet widely used in england , but should be standard practice across scotland by 2004 .

joseph berardino , who had been with andersen for 30 years , said he was leaving in bid to prevent the firm 's collapse . "
the fact is that the improper shredding of documents took place on my watch " joseph berardino departing andersen chief andersen faces criminal charges over allegations of destroying papers relating to the collapse of power giant enron , which filed for bankruptcy four months ago in the biggest ever us corporate failure .
" i felt i had to take this step today to put an exclamation point behind the voices of our people ... to say we are serious and we are a serious firm that deserves to continue here in the united states , " mr berardino told cnn 's moneyline show .
professor itzhak sharav from columbia university told the bbc 's world business report he believes mr berardino 's resignation heralds the collapse of andersen .
" clients who have been quitting , leaving in droves will continue to do so , in fact they will probably panic and think that they should do it as quickly as possible , " he said .
volcker deal mr berardino 's decision comes four days after paul volcker , who andersen appointed last month to come up with suggestions for restoring the firm 's reputation , urged a shake-up of senior personnel .
mr volcker , former chairman of the federal reserve , the us central bank , proposed a fresh seven-member board to run andersen .
he urged the us justice department in return to drop charges against andersen - although that is looking increasingly unlikely after new allegations about andersen involvement in inflated earnings reports at former client waste management .
the firm 's 1,700 partners , attempting to stem an exodus of clients in the wake of the enron scandal , have also urged mr berardino to step down .
mr berardino , whose term had been due to end in august 2004 , said he would leave the firm once a successor was appointed .
" while my nature is to keep fighting to protect our people and our clients , the fact is that the improper shredding of documents took place on my watch - and i believe it is now in the best interests of the firm for me to step down , " he wrote in an e-mail to staff .
fat four ?
in the meantime , the break-up of andersen 's global operations is continuing , with most of its asian units continuing to talk to kpmg - another of the big five auditors - about a merger .
five - in china , hong kong , russia , new zealand and australia - have decided to turn to other big five members , but the rest could still side with kpmg .
and the consolidation could spell trouble for accounting in general , according to a member of the only international accounting standards organisation .
the move from big five to fat four - kpmg , deloitte touch tohmatsu , pricewaterhousecoopers and ernst & young - is creating an " oligopoly " , gilbert gelard , one of the international accounting standards board 's 14 members , told afp newswire .
" i do not know how international accounting will be able to function with only four major auditors , " he warned .
lifelong employee mr berardino 's resignation comes 14 months after he was appointed chief executive , after three years on the board of the firm 's global overseeing body , andersen worldwide .
he was appointed a partner in 1982 and is a member of us organisations including the conference board , an esteemed new york-based business group .
he is also an adviser to the british american business council , and to the mayor of shanghai .
' serious errors ' within a year of his appointment , mr berardino was testifying before congress over andersen 's role in enron 's collapse .
" if my firm has made errors of judgement , we will acknowledge them , " he told the house of representatives committee on financial services .
" we will make changes needed to restore confidence . "
a month later , he admitted to reporters that andersen staff " made serious errors in judgement " in destroying documents .
" it was wrong .
there 's no other word for it , " he added .
but has insisted that andersen had not been involved in creating the web of partnerships implicated in enron 's collapse .
" we did not help to establish .
we reviewed the accounting that others developed , " he said .
silver lining earlier on tuesday , alan greenspan , the fed 's current chairman , said that business leaders had improved their regimes since the enron scandal broke .
" corporate reputation is fortunately re-emerging out of the ashes of the enron debacle as a significant economic value , " mr greenspan said in a speech at new york university 's stern school of business .
" corporate governance has doubtless already measurably improved as a result of this greater market discipline in the wake of recent events , " he said .

the visit of uk education minister estelle morris ' to city hall was amongst the events affected by the strike .

" it is quite clear with the timing it was about much more . "
angry workers are staging a one-day strike at city hall in a bid to overturn the ruling .
the visit of uk education minister estelle morris ' to city hall was amongst the events affected by the strike .

he highlighted problems faced by the children 's services department at cardiff county council and councillors rejected an appeal earlier in march .
unison 's cardiff branch secretary peter king said local union members were " disgusted , to say the least . "
" this was a very difficult decision to make , " he said .
" but we simply can not allow the authority to ' shoot the messenger ' instead of dealing with serious under-resorting of children 's services .
" unless we stand up for charles faber , then this authority is quite capable of declaring open season on any member who gets in their way . "
claims dismissed he claimed authority officials had banned use of e-mail for union business and hinted industrial action may not be confined to cardiff .
but councillors have denied the claims and maintained mr faber was fired on legitimate grounds .
the strike is affecting some leisure centres , libraries and council offices , but refuse collection would still go ahead , unison said .

at a summit in nigeria on tuesday , 21 african states agreed on a communique which proposed eight draft codes of behaviour to be judged by an independent , credible african institute " separate from the political process and structures " .
the african peer review mechanism , as it has been dubbed , should make sure " that policies of african countries are based on best current knowledge and practices " , the communique said .

the immediate accolades from many neighbouring states for robert mugabe 's win in zimbabwe 's presidential elections earlier this month - despite credible evidence of widespread abuse of the electoral process by his government - sparked sharp criticism .
