police carried out a series of baton charges on a section of england supporters who tried to tear down metal fences separating them from slovak fans .
but the fa says the authorities used excessive force in dealing with the fans .
it will also be making an official complaint about the racist chanting which emile heskey and ashley cole were subjected to by the home crowd .
england manager sven-goran eriksson said : " it looked like many years ago when i was in belgium in the heysel stadium .
it 's crazy that football should still be like that .
" it did not look good at all , there were people running all over the place and i hope no-one was injured . "
" it looked like many years ago when i was in belgium in the heysel stadium .
it 's crazy that football should still be like that . "
sven-goran eriksson fa spokesman adrian bevington said : " the racism is very disappointing .
" throughout the game emile heskey and ashley cole , in particular , suffered a torrent of racist abuse whenever they got the ball and they deserve credit for the way they conducted themselves throughout that . "
heskey added : " it was n't just a few people it was the whole stadium .
it was very hard but we just tried to block it out . "
the violence occurred during the first half of the game , but calm was quickly restored .
the second half passed off peacefully and england went on to score two goals , both from michael owen , to clinch the tie .
the trouble apparently started when visiting fans in the stands behind one goal began hurling missiles at nearby slovak supporters .
as seats were being thrown , police wearing riot helmets and wielding batons forced england supporters to retreat .
loudspeaker announcements in english urged the visiting fans to behave .
the violence was the last thing the fa wanted , particularly after two fans were wounded in a shooting incident the previous night .
phil holland , 31 , from worcester , was shot in the leg while gareth jones , 30 , from coventry , was shot in the throat .
police in bratislava investigating the shooting have questioned a pair of private security workers .
they said the manager of a bar in the city centre called a security service to remove about 60 england fans after they had reportedly been trying to pull their own pints of beer .
security guards opened fire , said police spokeswoman marta bujnakova .
surgery police found 16 cartridges in the bar and have detained two security officers , but are still searching for another .
mr holland , a tiler , said : " we had been in the pub in the main square and were walking towards a nightclub when we heard some shots being fired .
" at first they seemed to be firing into the air .
" we all moved away from the noise - but then i suddenly realised i had been shot in the leg . "
mr jones has undergone surgery to remove the bullet , but is said to be in a stable condition .

" i intended no disrespect to any sincere , law-abiding muslim . "
in an interview conducted on 30 september for the 6 october edition of 60 minutes , mr falwell said : " i think mohammed was a terrorist .
i read enough by both muslims and non-muslims , -lrb- to decide -rrb- that he was a violent man , a man of war . "
' outrageous ' the iranian foreign minister , kamal kharrazi , condemned mr falwell 's remarks as an incitement to conflict .
" what this american priest said encourages war among civilisations and also increases crises and it should be confronted , " mr kharrazi said .
he said the remarks were " part of a propaganda war by the us mass media and the zionists " .
falwell said the question he was asked was " loaded " british foreign secretary jack straw said mr falwell 's remarks were " outrageous and insulting " and " as much an insult to me as a christian as they are to muslims " .
mr falwell insisted that he has always respected other faiths .
" i have always shown respect for other religions , faiths and denominations , " he said .
" unfortunately , i answered one controversial and loaded question at the conclusion of an hour-long cbs interview which i should not have answered .
that was a mistake and i apologise . "

mr falwell , a leading figure of the american christian right , is well-known for making controversial comments .
shortly after the 11 september attacks , he said that gays , atheists , civil-rights activists and legal abortions in the us had angered god and " helped this happen " .

he declined both offers .

i 'm not about to admit to something i did n't do .

cinea has won a grant to develop its system further and hopes to have a prototype ready within two years .
currently there are few cinemas that are showing digital versions of films , and the numbers that can do so are not expected to rise significantly by 2004 .
however , cinea claims that eventually it will be able to cut film piracy by 50 % .

cinea has won a grant to develop its system further and hopes to have a prototype ready within two years .
currently there are few cinemas that are showing digital versions of films , and the numbers that can do so are not expected to rise significantly by 2004 .
however , cinea claims that eventually it will be able to cut film piracy by 50 % .

military ruler general pervez musharraf said the poll had been ' free and fair ' .
senior pakistani officials believe the muted response by the united states on the allegations of pre-poll manipulations is an indirect endorsement of the election process .
the bbc 's correspondent in islamabad , zaffar abbas , says such criticism is not likely to affect president musharraf 's relations with the western countries .
no overall majority results from thursday 's election give a party allied to president pervez musharraf the most seats , but it is well short of an overall majority .
in a preliminary report , the eu observers said the authorities had misused state resources to favour political parties , especially the pakistan muslim league quaid-e-azam .
official results pakistan muslim league-quaid-e-azam - 77 pakistan people 's party - 63 muttahida majlis-e-amal - 45 seats pakistan muslim league-nawaz - 14 others - 68 poll void in one constituency there will be repolling in two constituencies eu chief observer john cushnahan said the pakistani military authorities engaged in " unjustified interference with electoral arrangements and the democratic process " .
" regrettably ... the pakistan authorities engaged in a course of action which resulted in serious flaws in the electoral process , " mr cushnahan said .
the observers also accused general musharraf of hampering the election campaign by restricting rallies and banning processions .
and they criticised the new constitutional amendments made by general musharraf before the elections , which include giving him the right to dismiss parliament .
but they also said a number of steps had been taken to improve the electoral process , including reducing the voter age to 18 and reserving seats in parliament for women .
and the observers praised polling staff for performing their duties in often difficult conditions .
religious revival it was pakistan 's first general election since general musharraf seized power in a coup in 1999 .
a coalition of religious parties which criticised general musharraf for backing the american military campaign in afghanistan did much better than expected , coming a strong third after the party of former prime minister benazir bhutto .
observers say the religious parties could hold the balance of power .
quaid-e-azam , seen as supportive of general musharraf , won 77 of the 272 contested constituency seats , according to the official count .
the pakistan people 's party , aligned with former prime minister benazir bhutto - who was banned from participating - came in second with 63 seats , while the religious muttahida majlis-e-amal -lrb- mma -rrb- won 45 .
the party aligned with former prime minister nawaz sharif , the pakistan muslim league-nawaz , won 14 seats - and he also criticised the election .
traditionally , the religious parties have had trouble winning seats , but the mma 's anti-us message went down particularly well in areas bordering afghanistan , where there had been some support for the taleban .
our correspondent says that although general musharraf has declared his full backing for the us operations , it is clear he has not taken the whole country with him .
mrs bhutto , speaking from london , questioned what her party says was an inexplicable delay in the counting of the ballots and announcing the results .
" it has been a highly controversial election and we believe there has been widespread rigging , " she said .
mr sharif , who was overthrown by general musharraf and accused of corruption , was also banned from participation .
the united states welcomed the election as " an important milestone in pakistan 's ongoing transition to democracy " .

mr mcconnell said football clubs , politicians , police and local councils should work together and use their influence to vanquish the generations-old blight of bigotry .
violence and arrests at the celtic-rangers old firm clash in glasgow last week showed scotland 's " darkest side " and was a " wake-up call " that bigotry was alive and well .
he said : " an old firm football match , once again , was the trigger that resulted in a very public display of the deep-rooted sectarianism that permeates much of scotland 's society . "
" football clubs must ban those who are responsible for whipping up the frenzy of hatred and violence and they must act against the sale of symbols of hatred at their grounds . "
the problem was not just confined to the west of scotland , the motherwell and wishaw msp insisted , but infected communities everywhere north of the border .
writing in the sunday herald he added : " i have become convinced that this is not just a scar on scotland 's past , but a reality today . "
the scots labour leader , who is from a church of scotland family but married into a catholic family , said he had himself encountered bigotry when he left home and went to university .
" i quickly learned that being asked which school you went to was not a casual inquiry into your background , it was a short way of asking your religion , " he wrote .
' culture of shame ' " i also have first-hand experience of the repercussions that follow when you make a stand against sectarianism , the whispering behind your back as people try to work out what religion you are . "
he said that police officers and the judiciary must be seen to be impartial and above suspicion of sectarian motivation .
and he welcomed initiatives by local councils to develop joint denominational and non-denominational schools .
mr mcconnell warned : " to eliminate sectarianism everyone must accept that this is not harmless banter - this is mindless violence and a culture of shame . "

they were trying to digest the news , filtering through from the surfing town of kuta , that a bomb had killed many people on a busy saturday night .
i 've been working here for nine years , taking people down the rapids twice a day .
this is the first time i 've felt unhappy moon , balinese rafting guide one of the water rafting guides , a young balinese man called moon , tried to mask how upset he was at the news .
asked about what had happened in kuta , he whispered a few vagaries about an " accident " and " people killed " .
but he was worried about the safety of his family living in kuta , whom he had not yet heard from .
he added : " i 've been working here for nine years , taking people down the rapids twice a day .
this is the first time i 've felt unhappy . "
tranquil no more bali has a reputation as a harmonious island , with hindus , muslims and christians living here peacefully .
this sort of thing was thought to happen on the neighbouring island of lombok , rafting guide moon said , but not here .
bali had a reputation as a peaceful place among the tourists , especially the australians , the talk was of people packing their bags and getting on the next available flight home .
the sari club in kuta , known locally as sc , was well liked by the many foreigners who chose the town as their base on bali .
one of the reasons it was popular among tourists was because it actively discouraged local gigolos who cruise the town .
reassuring tourists the explosion at the club was so loud that it could be heard 25 minutes ' drive away in the quiet beach resort of sanur .
there , local hoteliers were endeavouring to reassure their guests that nothing similar would happen to them .
visitors returned to their hotel rooms to find a photocopied sheet explaining what had happened the night before , and telling them that a state of security had now been declared throughout the island .
bali tv was showing continuous footage from saturday night 's explosions , accompanied by mournful music .
some of the scenes were graphic images of bodies wrapped in white , bloodstained sheets , while others showed people being treated in hospital for their injuries .
the balinese have a tradition of placing flower offerings to ward off demons outside their houses and businesses .
but on saturday night , it seems that those demons came to town .

they were trying to digest the news , filtering through from the surfing town of kuta , that a bomb had killed many people on a busy saturday night . "
i 've been working here for nine years , taking people down the rapids twice a day .
this is the first time i 've felt unhappy " moon , balinese rafting guide one of the water rafting guides , a young balinese man called moon , tried to mask how upset he was at the news .
asked about what had happened in kuta , he whispered a few vagaries about an " accident " and " people killed " .
but he was worried about the safety of his family living in kuta , whom he had not yet heard from .
he added : " i 've been working here for nine years , taking people down the rapids twice a day .
this is the first time i 've felt unhappy . "
tranquil no more bali has a reputation as a harmonious island , with hindus , muslims and christians living here peacefully .
this sort of thing was thought to happen on the neighbouring island of lombok , rafting guide moon said , but not here .
among the tourists , especially the australians , the talk was of people packing their bags and getting on the next available flight home .
the sari club in kuta , known locally as sc , was well liked by the many foreigners who chose the town as their base on bali .
one of the reasons it was popular among tourists was because it actively discouraged local gigolos who cruise the town .
reassuring tourists the explosion at the club was so loud that it could be heard 25 minutes ' drive away in the quiet beach resort of sanur .
there , local hoteliers were endeavouring to reassure their guests that nothing similar would happen to them .
visitors returned to their hotel rooms to find a photocopied sheet explaining what had happened the night before , and telling them that a state of security had now been declared throughout the island .
bali tv was showing continuous footage from saturday night 's explosions , accompanied by mournful music .
some of the scenes were graphic images of bodies wrapped in white , bloodstained sheets , while others showed people being treated in hospital for their injuries .
the balinese have a tradition of placing flower offerings to ward off demons outside their houses and businesses .
but on saturday night , it seems that those demons came to town .

bertie ahern : good morning david .
david frost : good morning .
bertie ahern : i think david unfortunately it looks as if again we 're going to see the suspension of the institutions but we 're not seeing the suspension of the agreement so working closely with tony blair , working closely with the british government and john reid , i think we have to , to now try and look at all of the outstanding issues and their many , what david and martin have been saying clearly , the fact that violence still exists , clearly the fact that there is still not a full move away from the past , from the activities of the past into total democratic means , that 's creating tensions , it 's , it 's breaking trust and what we have to try to deal with , that problem along with a lot of the other outstanding problems and there are outstanding problems , there 's demilitarisation , there is the whole issue of paramilitary activities , there 's the sectarianism that , that 's in northern society and i think we have to try in this period of suspension to come to a total and holistic approach to dealing with these issues .
david frost : but i think that , yes absolutely , i think seeing both david trimble and martin mcguinness there back to back as it were , there did n't seem to be much , much room for debate or movement , no movement from martin mcguinness on those points , what can you do , what 's the magic formula that could make the two sides meet up again ?
bertie ahern : well you know i know they 've opposing views that , that 's always the issue and both of those , both martin and david both sit in the executive , they 're cabinet colleagues together and you can see the problems but i think probably if there was a good bit of this david , is that we have moved an awful lot of the problems , the outstanding problems out of the way , there remains a number , they 're very serious ones , they 're complex ones .
what i do believe giving a span of time and hopefully not too much time because i would not like to see the institutions being suspended for long , i do n't like to see the institutions suspended at all quite frankly , what the two governments are , are the guardians of the agreement and both tony blair and i and john reid and brian cowan we 're very clear on what the issues are and what we have to try between the parties to build the trust and come to solutions to these problems and there are problems what martin and david said are both correct and these are problems of last week , there was the fact that we were going to see the institutions suspended by the 18th of january .
so we have to try and , it 's no good dodging the issues , we know the half a dozen issues that are there , we know that there has to be a full move away from violence to democratic means and we have to look at these issues and try to broker agreement between them .
david frost : but at the moment it would seem that from what tony blair has said and what david trimble has said and so on , that the next move lies with sinn fein to come up with answers to john reid 's questions and tony blair 's question , the next move is up to them is n't it ?
bertie ahern : well i think in some ways martin mcguinness answered that question for you david and i think it 's a useful answer , he said that both he and gerry adams are totally committed to trying to deal with the question of moving the ira from the past into the future and of course that is the question that creates most difficulty for the trust in the unionist community and for david trimble .
and the other side of it martin mcguinness 's agenda there 's the fact that the sectarianism , that it was quite a different , difficult summer , there was problems at the inter-faith areas , it 's no good saying who is , who is to blame for that because there was blame i suppose on all sides .
but , these are difficulties they have to come to resolution in , i think that having moved on , it 's eight years now david since the first ceasefire , it 's five years since the second , enormous progress has been made , it 's a pity we have to suspend institutions to resolve the problems but if that 's what has to happen i think we should use the time as quickly as possible to try and resolve this because there are elections next may and i do not think it would be a good thing to have a suspension all the way to next may because that would create vacuums and tensions and you , you and i know what happens when that happens .
david frost : there are , there are also elections coming up next weekend but of course they 're in , in the irish republic and there 's this vital vote , the second time this vote has taken place to ratify the nice treaty which has to be unanimously ratified and therefore when , when your people by 54 i think to 46 rejected it that put the whole thing in danger .
are you very confident you 're going to turn that around next week because the polls yesterday were encouraging but with a large number of do n't knows would you say you 're confident , mildly confident or fearful ?
bertie ahern : well hopeful i 'd say david , neither of those things , but we , we have worked very hard since september of last year to change the context of what 's happened last time around , we 've had a forum for europe that 's gone around the country debating the issues , explaining the issues of europe .
we have given constitutional guarantee to the issue of neutrality so next week a vote for irish neutrality is a yes vote because we 're now putting the neutrality wording into our own constitution .
we have also done our best to change our parliamentary scrutiny of eu matters which was an issue people were concerned about .
but you 're correct david it 's a crucial vote , it 's a crucial vote for ireland , it 's a crucial vote for europe , it 's a crucial vote to the whole process of enlargement .
the 12 countries that want to join europe in this decade we stand between that and hopefully the , as the debate goes on here and comes to the last number of days that , and it has been a lively debate , it 's been a very intensive campaign , totally opposite to the last time , that i hope that the irish people will support this .
i hope they see the importance to all this , it 's important to us nationally , it 's important to our present economic position to the role that we hold in europe , the significant part that we play in europe and very much it 's important to the applicant countries who wish to join for the future .
david frost : and are you predicting victory next sunday ?
bertie ahern : well we , we certainly hope that , i mean the polls would show that we 're ahead but as you know david , there 's only one poll that ever matters in an election , the people that come out on the day .
david frost : that 's what , that 's what the politician always said , yes to deal with the polls and the one that really matters but on the one that really matters if it went wrong , i mean a no , does that mean in fact that the whole idea of enlargement is dead , does it mean that in fact ireland might have to leave the european union ?
bertie ahern : well it would create grave questions for us , i think people would certainly immediately question our sincerity to the european model , they would question whether we were sincere about the role we play within europe and we have argued all of those during the campaign .
of course the bigger question for europe is , there is no other mechanism , there is no other way of enlargement proceeding without the ratification by all member states of the nice treaty so therefore we would create huge uncertainty , an enormous dilemma because a week after the irish vote , the following weekend the european council , the final stages of the discussions with ten countries start and they 've all to be finished by christmas , they 're very well advanced and they 're probably very near completion anyway .
so we would throw that into chaos and certainly david that is not what i want to see happen , it 's not what the government want to see , but more importantly i think it 's not what the irish people really want to do and so therefore i 'm hoping that the importance of this vote will be understood by the irish people , i 've done my best to explain it as i 've many groups outside of the political domain and inside the political domain so that we can get a yes vote and let europe move on the way the irish people have always ... the last 30 years played a positive constructive role in european matters .
david frost : thank you very much indeed bertie ahern , thank you bertie .
