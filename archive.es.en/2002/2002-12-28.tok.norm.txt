in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .
the company has not offered any proof but has said it will allow independent researchers to conduct genetic testing of the baby girl , named " eve , " in order to confirm its assertion .
there is currently no world-wide ban on human cloning , but it is forbidden in most countries .
experts warn that the consequences of cloning are incalculable - and the few successful attempts that have been undertaken have been riddled with genetic errors .
for example : dolly , the sheep cloned in 1997 , has developed early arthritis .
cloned mice live relatively short lives and become unusually overweight in their later years .
cloning researcher george seidel at colorado state university says the success rate in animal cloning is only two percent - meaning for every 50 animals cloned , only two would be successful .
" that may be acceptable for cattle , " he says , " but it 's surely not for human children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severino antinori the debate over the morality and ethics of human cloning has been roaring since italian doctor severino antinori -lrb- photo -rrb- announced , separately , in april that the first cloned baby would be born in january 2003 .
but doubt also looms over antinori 's claims .
" it is assumed worldwide that mr. antinori lacks the scientific capacity , " says markus montag , chairman of the german working group on human reproduction biology .
montag notes that current cloning technologies are inefficient and that researchers would need to use thousands of egg cells from hundreds of women .
" it 's hardly possible that antinori would be able to do something like that on the quiet , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2002 german economic outlook a mixed bag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2002 was an ' annus horribilis ' for the german economy experts are predicting a gradual improvement in germany 's economic growth .
but they 're also saying the number of people out of work could reach 4.5 million next year .
so what 's the prognosis ? as the year comes to an end , germans are hoping they 'll be able to put what 's been an economic ' annus horribilis ' behind them .
europe 's leading economic power found the going in 2002 especially tough .
after the relatively smooth introduction of the euro as legal tender on jan .
1 , 2002 , the economy took a slow and determined dive from which it has yet to surface .
with the global economic forecast for 2003 looking slightly better , germany is hoping to feel the effects of a faster us-led recovery in the coming year .
but there still no firm indications that growth will be solid , and many people believe europe will be lucky to see any sort of rebound .
pessimism the prognoses for the germany economy in the coming year are mostly negative .
some studies suggest business confidence is at a 10-year low .
the director of the german economic institute , gerhard fels , says a survey of 44 employer organizations has shown that most businesses predict zero- or negative growth in the areas of turnover , investment and employment .
and industry leaders are pointing their fingers at the government 's soft approach to the unions , says fels .
germany 's retail sector is reeling after poor christmas sales .
shops have dropped their prices dramatically this week , desparate to move stock " at practically any price , " says the head of the retailers ' association handelsverband bag , johann hellwege .
even as prices drop , budget cuts are expected to start to bite in the coming months , and that means germans will have less money in their pockets to spend .
this is not good news for the country 's economic prospects .
unless consumer demand increases , businesses will not be able to invest , and the brakes will be applied once more .
fuel , meanwhile , has already become more expensive , as a result of the threat of war in the middle east , which has led opec to curb oil production , and strikes in venezuela .
germany 's biggest fuel company , aral / bp , is charging 1.05 euro -lrb- $ 1.10 -rrb- per liter for gas , and a new environment tax to be introduced on the first of january will send the price up by a further 3 to 5 cents .
unemployment rising the economic outlook for 2003 looks bleakest of all in germany 's eastern states .
unemployment , much higher than in the west , is at best expected to bottom out in the coming year .
economists have warned against drawing false conclusions from the higher growth forecasts in the east , which is still recovering from the devastating effects of the floods in 2002 .
in the country as a whole , the number of people out of work shot up to 4.22 million in december , the highest level in five years .
blaming seasonal factors and the long-term ill health of the economy , the government now forecasts a rise in the number of people without jobs to more than 4.5 million in february .
the latest forecast comes less than a week after the economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said he was confident unemployment would fall below 4 million in 2003 .
growth forecast unrealistic even if the pressure on europe 's economies eases slightly in 2003 , the change will not be dramatic .
experts are predicting the euro zone to expand by only 1.3 percent .
the german government has forecast 1.5 percent growth in 2003 .
but the european commission believes this is too optimistic .
it expects the euro zone 's leading economy to expand by no more than one percent next year .
this will mean the government wo n't be able to bring down its budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product as required by the european stability and growth pact , which ensures the stability of the euro .
seeing the brighter side despite the gloomy forecasts , optimists are also making their voices heard .
the president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , on friday called for the doomsday predictions to stop .
indeed , official figures for 2002 show germany 's economy stabilizing , after reaching its lowest point in the first quarter of the year .

but they 're also saying the number of people out of work could reach 4.5 million next year .
so what 's the prognosis ? as the year comes to an end , germans are hoping they 'll be able to put what 's been an economic ' annus horribilis ' behind them .
europe 's leading economic power found the going in 2002 especially tough .
after the relatively smooth introduction of the euro as legal tender on jan .
1 , 2002 , the economy took a slow and determined dive from which it has yet to surface .
with the global economic forecast for 2003 looking slightly better , germany is hoping to feel the effects of a faster us-led recovery in the coming year .
but there still no firm indications that growth will be solid , and many people believe europe will be lucky to see any sort of rebound .
pessimism the prognoses for the germany economy in the coming year are mostly negative .
some studies suggest business confidence is at a 10-year low .
the director of the german economic institute , gerhard fels , says a survey of 44 employer organizations has shown that most businesses predict zero- or negative growth in the areas of turnover , investment and employment .
and industry leaders are pointing their fingers at the government 's soft approach to the unions , says fels .
germany 's retail sector is reeling after poor christmas sales .
shops have dropped their prices dramatically this week , desparate to move stock " at practically any price , " says the head of the retailers ' association handelsverband bag , johann hellwege .
even as prices drop , budget cuts are expected to start to bite in the coming months , and that means germans will have less money in their pockets to spend .
this is not good news for the country 's economic prospects .

in the country as a whole , the number of people out of work shot up to 4.22 million in december , the highest level in five years .
blaming seasonal factors and the long-term ill health of the economy , the government now forecasts a rise in the number of people without jobs to more than 4.5 million in february .
the latest forecast comes less than a week after the economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said he was confident unemployment would fall below 4 million in 2003 .
growth forecast unrealistic even if the pressure on europe 's economies eases slightly in 2003 , the change will not be dramatic .
experts are predicting the euro zone to expand by only 1.3 percent .
the german government has forecast 1.5 percent growth in 2003 .
but the european commission believes this is too optimistic .
it expects the euro zone 's leading economy to expand by no more than one percent next year .
this will mean the government wo n't be able to bring down its budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product as required by the european stability and growth pact , which ensures the stability of the euro .

in the latest softening of its position on a possible war against iraq , germany 's foreign minister says it 's possible berlin will vote in favor of such action at the un - depending on the conditions . the german government is further distancing itself from a clear refusal to participate in a war against iraq .
foreign minister joschka fischer said this weekend the possibility could not be ruled out that germany would vote in favor of military action if faced with the decision at the u.n. security council .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.12.2002 german religious leaders , scientists condemn " frankenstein " clone doctors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an army of me ?
in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .
the company has not offered any proof but has said it will allow independent researchers to conduct genetic testing of the baby girl , named " eve , " in order to confirm its assertion .
there is currently no world-wide ban on human cloning , but it is forbidden in most countries .
experts warn that the consequences of cloning are incalculable - and the few successful attempts that have been undertaken have been riddled with genetic errors .
for example : dolly , the sheep cloned in 1997 , has developed early arthritis .

in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .
the company has not offered any proof but has said it will allow independent researchers to conduct genetic testing of the baby girl , named " eve , " in order to confirm its assertion .
there is currently no world-wide ban on human cloning , but it is forbidden in most countries .
experts warn that the consequences of cloning are incalculable - and the few successful attempts that have been undertaken have been riddled with genetic errors .
for example : dolly , the sheep cloned in 1997 , has developed early arthritis .
cloned mice live relatively short lives and become unusually overweight in their later years .
cloning researcher george seidel at colorado state university says the success rate in animal cloning is only two percent - meaning for every 50 animals cloned , only two would be successful .

in the latest softening of its position on a possible war against iraq , germany 's foreign minister says it 's possible berlin will vote in favor of such action at the un - depending on the conditions . the german government is further distancing itself from a clear refusal to participate in a war against iraq .
foreign minister joschka fischer said this weekend the possibility could not be ruled out that germany would vote in favor of military action if faced with the decision at the u.n. security council .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .
1 .
no military participation in the interview , however , fischer reiterated the previous government position that germany would not send any soldiers into combat if war breaks out with iraq " if it is n't 100 percent convinced of the necessity of doing so . "
" what is certain is that we will not participate militarily in an intervention , " fischer told der spiegel .
it has become clear in recent weeks that it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in the event of an emergency .
since then , berlin has changed its tenor slightly .
the government has softened its refusal , saying it will not " actively " participate in a military action .
what it will do , however , is allow allies flyover rights and to use military bases located in germany in their actions .
diplomatic splits but the diplomatic situation for the federal government could get trickier come january , when a german representative participates in security council meetings .
hans blix , who is heading the un monitoring , verification and control commission in iraq , has until jan .
27 to declare whether or not iraq has fulfilled the tough weapons of mass destructions requirements set forth in un resolution 1441 .
at that point , the security council may consider taking military action against iraq .
if it does , germany could be forced to make a difficult decision .
then , in february , germany will become chair of the security council for a month , making the situation yet more difficult .
still , even fischer concedes the ultimate decision wo n't likely fall into german hands .
" we 're not the decisive player here - that 's the five standing members who have veto rights , " he told der spiegel .
and the chair position holds little by way of concrete power - most of its duties are related to mediation and organization . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
germany will join the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member next year and head the sanctions committee on iraq , a position that could place it at odds with its own stated foreign policy .

but there still no firm indications that growth will be solid , and many people believe europe will be lucky to see any sort of rebound .
pessimism the prognoses for the germany economy in the coming year are mostly negative .
some studies suggest business confidence is at a 10-year low .
the director of the german economic institute , gerhard fels , says a survey of 44 employer organizations has shown that most businesses predict zero- or negative growth in the areas of turnover , investment and employment .

the german government has forecast 1.5 percent growth in 2003 .
but the european commission believes this is too optimistic .
it expects the euro zone 's leading economy to expand by no more than one percent next year .

the director of the german economic institute , gerhard fels , says a survey of 44 employer organizations has shown that most businesses predict zero- or negative growth in the areas of turnover , investment and employment .

this is not good news for the country 's economic prospects .
unless consumer demand increases , businesses will not be able to invest , and the brakes will be applied once more .
fuel , meanwhile , has already become more expensive , as a result of the threat of war in the middle east , which has led opec to curb oil production , and strikes in venezuela .
germany 's biggest fuel company , aral / bp , is charging 1.05 euro -lrb- $ 1.10 -rrb- per liter for gas , and a new environment tax to be introduced on the first of january will send the price up by a further 3 to 5 cents .

the german government has forecast 1.5 percent growth in 2003 .
but the european commission believes this is too optimistic .

in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .
the company has not offered any proof but has said it will allow independent researchers to conduct genetic testing of the baby girl , named " eve , " in order to confirm its assertion .
there is currently no world-wide ban on human cloning , but it is forbidden in most countries .
experts warn that the consequences of cloning are incalculable - and the few successful attempts that have been undertaken have been riddled with genetic errors .
for example : dolly , the sheep cloned in 1997 , has developed early arthritis .
cloned mice live relatively short lives and become unusually overweight in their later years .
cloning researcher george seidel at colorado state university says the success rate in animal cloning is only two percent - meaning for every 50 animals cloned , only two would be successful .
" that may be acceptable for cattle , " he says , " but it 's surely not for human children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severino antinori the debate over the morality and ethics of human cloning has been roaring since italian doctor severino antinori -lrb- photo -rrb- announced , separately , in april that the first cloned baby would be born in january 2003 .
but doubt also looms over antinori 's claims .
" it is assumed worldwide that mr. antinori lacks the scientific capacity , " says markus montag , chairman of the german working group on human reproduction biology .
montag notes that current cloning technologies are inefficient and that researchers would need to use thousands of egg cells from hundreds of women .
" it 's hardly possible that antinori would be able to do something like that on the quiet , " he said .

in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .

in the latest softening of its position on a possible war against iraq , germany 's foreign minister says it 's possible berlin will vote in favor of such action at the un - depending on the conditions . the german government is further distancing itself from a clear refusal to participate in a war against iraq .
foreign minister joschka fischer said this weekend the possibility could not be ruled out that germany would vote in favor of military action if faced with the decision at the u.n. security council .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .
1 .
no military participation in the interview , however , fischer reiterated the previous government position that germany would not send any soldiers into combat if war breaks out with iraq " if it is n't 100 percent convinced of the necessity of doing so . "
" what is certain is that we will not participate militarily in an intervention , " fischer told der spiegel .
it has become clear in recent weeks that it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in the event of an emergency .
since then , berlin has changed its tenor slightly .
the government has softened its refusal , saying it will not " actively " participate in a military action .
what it will do , however , is allow allies flyover rights and to use military bases located in germany in their actions .
diplomatic splits but the diplomatic situation for the federal government could get trickier come january , when a german representative participates in security council meetings .
hans blix , who is heading the un monitoring , verification and control commission in iraq , has until jan .
27 to declare whether or not iraq has fulfilled the tough weapons of mass destructions requirements set forth in un resolution 1441 .
at that point , the security council may consider taking military action against iraq .
if it does , germany could be forced to make a difficult decision .
then , in february , germany will become chair of the security council for a month , making the situation yet more difficult .
still , even fischer concedes the ultimate decision wo n't likely fall into german hands .
" we 're not the decisive player here - that 's the five standing members who have veto rights , " he told der spiegel .
and the chair position holds little by way of concrete power - most of its duties are related to mediation and organization . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
germany will join the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member next year and head the sanctions committee on iraq , a position that could place it at odds with its own stated foreign policy .

in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .
the company has not offered any proof but has said it will allow independent researchers to conduct genetic testing of the baby girl , named " eve , " in order to confirm its assertion .
there is currently no world-wide ban on human cloning , but it is forbidden in most countries .
experts warn that the consequences of cloning are incalculable - and the few successful attempts that have been undertaken have been riddled with genetic errors .
for example : dolly , the sheep cloned in 1997 , has developed early arthritis .
cloned mice live relatively short lives and become unusually overweight in their later years .
cloning researcher george seidel at colorado state university says the success rate in animal cloning is only two percent - meaning for every 50 animals cloned , only two would be successful .
" that may be acceptable for cattle , " he says , " but it 's surely not for human children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severino antinori the debate over the morality and ethics of human cloning has been roaring since italian doctor severino antinori -lrb- photo -rrb- announced , separately , in april that the first cloned baby would be born in january 2003 .
but doubt also looms over antinori 's claims .
" it is assumed worldwide that mr. antinori lacks the scientific capacity , " says markus montag , chairman of the german working group on human reproduction biology .
montag notes that current cloning technologies are inefficient and that researchers would need to use thousands of egg cells from hundreds of women .
" it 's hardly possible that antinori would be able to do something like that on the quiet , " he said .
seeking a global ban germany and france together introduced a proposal for a global ban on cloning humans for reproductive purposes at the united nations , but negotiations have been stalled until september 2003 under strong resistance from the united states , spain and the philippines , who thought the resolution was n't restrictive enough . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants u.n.-sponsored ban on cloning germany renewed calls for a worldwide ban on cloning following italian doctor severino antorini 's announcment this week that the first cloned baby could be born in january .

in the latest softening of its position on a possible war against iraq , germany 's foreign minister says it 's possible berlin will vote in favor of such action at the un - depending on the conditions . the german government is further distancing itself from a clear refusal to participate in a war against iraq .
foreign minister joschka fischer said this weekend the possibility could not be ruled out that germany would vote in favor of military action if faced with the decision at the u.n. security council .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .

it has become clear in recent weeks that it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in the event of an emergency .
since then , berlin has changed its tenor slightly .
the government has softened its refusal , saying it will not " actively " participate in a military action .

at that point , the security council may consider taking military action against iraq .
if it does , germany could be forced to make a difficult decision .
then , in february , germany will become chair of the security council for a month , making the situation yet more difficult .
still , even fischer concedes the ultimate decision wo n't likely fall into german hands .
" we 're not the decisive player here - that 's the five standing members who have veto rights , " he told der spiegel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.12.2002 german economic outlook a mixed bag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2002 was an ' annus horribilis ' for the german economy experts are predicting a gradual improvement in germany 's economic growth .
but they 're also saying the number of people out of work could reach 4.5 million next year .
so what 's the prognosis ? as the year comes to an end , germans are hoping they 'll be able to put what 's been an economic ' annus horribilis ' behind them .
europe 's leading economic power found the going in 2002 especially tough .
after the relatively smooth introduction of the euro as legal tender on jan .
1 , 2002 , the economy took a slow and determined dive from which it has yet to surface .
with the global economic forecast for 2003 looking slightly better , germany is hoping to feel the effects of a faster us-led recovery in the coming year .
but there still no firm indications that growth will be solid , and many people believe europe will be lucky to see any sort of rebound .
pessimism the prognoses for the germany economy in the coming year are mostly negative .
some studies suggest business confidence is at a 10-year low .
the director of the german economic institute , gerhard fels , says a survey of 44 employer organizations has shown that most businesses predict zero- or negative growth in the areas of turnover , investment and employment .
and industry leaders are pointing their fingers at the government 's soft approach to the unions , says fels .
germany 's retail sector is reeling after poor christmas sales .
shops have dropped their prices dramatically this week , desparate to move stock " at practically any price , " says the head of the retailers ' association handelsverband bag , johann hellwege .
even as prices drop , budget cuts are expected to start to bite in the coming months , and that means germans will have less money in their pockets to spend .
this is not good news for the country 's economic prospects .
unless consumer demand increases , businesses will not be able to invest , and the brakes will be applied once more .
fuel , meanwhile , has already become more expensive , as a result of the threat of war in the middle east , which has led opec to curb oil production , and strikes in venezuela .
germany 's biggest fuel company , aral / bp , is charging 1.05 euro -lrb- $ 1.10 -rrb- per liter for gas , and a new environment tax to be introduced on the first of january will send the price up by a further 3 to 5 cents .
unemployment rising the economic outlook for 2003 looks bleakest of all in germany 's eastern states .
unemployment , much higher than in the west , is at best expected to bottom out in the coming year .
economists have warned against drawing false conclusions from the higher growth forecasts in the east , which is still recovering from the devastating effects of the floods in 2002 .
in the country as a whole , the number of people out of work shot up to 4.22 million in december , the highest level in five years .
blaming seasonal factors and the long-term ill health of the economy , the government now forecasts a rise in the number of people without jobs to more than 4.5 million in february .
the latest forecast comes less than a week after the economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said he was confident unemployment would fall below 4 million in 2003 .
growth forecast unrealistic even if the pressure on europe 's economies eases slightly in 2003 , the change will not be dramatic .
experts are predicting the euro zone to expand by only 1.3 percent .
the german government has forecast 1.5 percent growth in 2003 .
but the european commission believes this is too optimistic .
it expects the euro zone 's leading economy to expand by no more than one percent next year .
this will mean the government wo n't be able to bring down its budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product as required by the european stability and growth pact , which ensures the stability of the euro .
seeing the brighter side despite the gloomy forecasts , optimists are also making their voices heard .
the president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , on friday called for the doomsday predictions to stop .
indeed , official figures for 2002 show germany 's economy stabilizing , after reaching its lowest point in the first quarter of the year .
that 's led some financial experts to predict improvement in the coming year , citing growing business confidence and expectations of the benefits to flow from the government 's labor reforms .
" the economy is looking to the future with more confidence , " financial consultant roland berger told germany 's bild newspaper .

but they 're also saying the number of people out of work could reach 4.5 million next year .
so what 's the prognosis ? as the year comes to an end , germans are hoping they 'll be able to put what 's been an economic ' annus horribilis ' behind them .
europe 's leading economic power found the going in 2002 especially tough .
after the relatively smooth introduction of the euro as legal tender on jan .
1 , 2002 , the economy took a slow and determined dive from which it has yet to surface .
with the global economic forecast for 2003 looking slightly better , germany is hoping to feel the effects of a faster us-led recovery in the coming year .
but there still no firm indications that growth will be solid , and many people believe europe will be lucky to see any sort of rebound .
pessimism the prognoses for the germany economy in the coming year are mostly negative .
some studies suggest business confidence is at a 10-year low .
the director of the german economic institute , gerhard fels , says a survey of 44 employer organizations has shown that most businesses predict zero- or negative growth in the areas of turnover , investment and employment .
and industry leaders are pointing their fingers at the government 's soft approach to the unions , says fels .
germany 's retail sector is reeling after poor christmas sales .
shops have dropped their prices dramatically this week , desparate to move stock " at practically any price , " says the head of the retailers ' association handelsverband bag , johann hellwege .
even as prices drop , budget cuts are expected to start to bite in the coming months , and that means germans will have less money in their pockets to spend .
this is not good news for the country 's economic prospects .
unless consumer demand increases , businesses will not be able to invest , and the brakes will be applied once more .
fuel , meanwhile , has already become more expensive , as a result of the threat of war in the middle east , which has led opec to curb oil production , and strikes in venezuela .
germany 's biggest fuel company , aral / bp , is charging 1.05 euro -lrb- $ 1.10 -rrb- per liter for gas , and a new environment tax to be introduced on the first of january will send the price up by a further 3 to 5 cents .
unemployment rising the economic outlook for 2003 looks bleakest of all in germany 's eastern states .
unemployment , much higher than in the west , is at best expected to bottom out in the coming year .
economists have warned against drawing false conclusions from the higher growth forecasts in the east , which is still recovering from the devastating effects of the floods in 2002 .
in the country as a whole , the number of people out of work shot up to 4.22 million in december , the highest level in five years .
blaming seasonal factors and the long-term ill health of the economy , the government now forecasts a rise in the number of people without jobs to more than 4.5 million in february .
the latest forecast comes less than a week after the economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said he was confident unemployment would fall below 4 million in 2003 .
growth forecast unrealistic even if the pressure on europe 's economies eases slightly in 2003 , the change will not be dramatic .
experts are predicting the euro zone to expand by only 1.3 percent .
the german government has forecast 1.5 percent growth in 2003 .
but the european commission believes this is too optimistic .
it expects the euro zone 's leading economy to expand by no more than one percent next year .
this will mean the government wo n't be able to bring down its budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product as required by the european stability and growth pact , which ensures the stability of the euro .
seeing the brighter side despite the gloomy forecasts , optimists are also making their voices heard .
the president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , on friday called for the doomsday predictions to stop .
indeed , official figures for 2002 show germany 's economy stabilizing , after reaching its lowest point in the first quarter of the year .
that 's led some financial experts to predict improvement in the coming year , citing growing business confidence and expectations of the benefits to flow from the government 's labor reforms .
" the economy is looking to the future with more confidence , " financial consultant roland berger told germany 's bild newspaper .
" as long as industry is optimistic about the future , then we 'll start to see more investment and we 'll be creating more jobs , " said berger .
that 's backed up by figures which show that 38 percent of companies are expecting next year to be an improvement on 2002 , and a further 35 percent think the economic situation wo n't get worse .

in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .
the company has not offered any proof but has said it will allow independent researchers to conduct genetic testing of the baby girl , named " eve , " in order to confirm its assertion .
there is currently no world-wide ban on human cloning , but it is forbidden in most countries .
experts warn that the consequences of cloning are incalculable - and the few successful attempts that have been undertaken have been riddled with genetic errors .
for example : dolly , the sheep cloned in 1997 , has developed early arthritis .
cloned mice live relatively short lives and become unusually overweight in their later years .
cloning researcher george seidel at colorado state university says the success rate in animal cloning is only two percent - meaning for every 50 animals cloned , only two would be successful .
" that may be acceptable for cattle , " he says , " but it 's surely not for human children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severino antinori the debate over the morality and ethics of human cloning has been roaring since italian doctor severino antinori -lrb- photo -rrb- announced , separately , in april that the first cloned baby would be born in january 2003 .
but doubt also looms over antinori 's claims .
" it is assumed worldwide that mr. antinori lacks the scientific capacity , " says markus montag , chairman of the german working group on human reproduction biology .

in the latest softening of its position on a possible war against iraq , germany 's foreign minister says it 's possible berlin will vote in favor of such action at the un - depending on the conditions . the german government is further distancing itself from a clear refusal to participate in a war against iraq .
foreign minister joschka fischer said this weekend the possibility could not be ruled out that germany would vote in favor of military action if faced with the decision at the u.n. security council .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .
1 .
no military participation in the interview , however , fischer reiterated the previous government position that germany would not send any soldiers into combat if war breaks out with iraq " if it is n't 100 percent convinced of the necessity of doing so . "
" what is certain is that we will not participate militarily in an intervention , " fischer told der spiegel .
it has become clear in recent weeks that it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in the event of an emergency .
since then , berlin has changed its tenor slightly .
the government has softened its refusal , saying it will not " actively " participate in a military action .
what it will do , however , is allow allies flyover rights and to use military bases located in germany in their actions .
diplomatic splits but the diplomatic situation for the federal government could get trickier come january , when a german representative participates in security council meetings .
hans blix , who is heading the un monitoring , verification and control commission in iraq , has until jan .
27 to declare whether or not iraq has fulfilled the tough weapons of mass destructions requirements set forth in un resolution 1441 .
at that point , the security council may consider taking military action against iraq .
if it does , germany could be forced to make a difficult decision .
then , in february , germany will become chair of the security council for a month , making the situation yet more difficult .
still , even fischer concedes the ultimate decision wo n't likely fall into german hands .
" we 're not the decisive player here - that 's the five standing members who have veto rights , " he told der spiegel .
and the chair position holds little by way of concrete power - most of its duties are related to mediation and organization . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
germany will join the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member next year and head the sanctions committee on iraq , a position that could place it at odds with its own stated foreign policy .

but they 're also saying the number of people out of work could reach 4.5 million next year .
so what 's the prognosis ? as the year comes to an end , germans are hoping they 'll be able to put what 's been an economic ' annus horribilis ' behind them .
europe 's leading economic power found the going in 2002 especially tough .
after the relatively smooth introduction of the euro as legal tender on jan .
1 , 2002 , the economy took a slow and determined dive from which it has yet to surface .
with the global economic forecast for 2003 looking slightly better , germany is hoping to feel the effects of a faster us-led recovery in the coming year .
but there still no firm indications that growth will be solid , and many people believe europe will be lucky to see any sort of rebound .
pessimism the prognoses for the germany economy in the coming year are mostly negative .
some studies suggest business confidence is at a 10-year low .
the director of the german economic institute , gerhard fels , says a survey of 44 employer organizations has shown that most businesses predict zero- or negative growth in the areas of turnover , investment and employment .
and industry leaders are pointing their fingers at the government 's soft approach to the unions , says fels .
germany 's retail sector is reeling after poor christmas sales .
shops have dropped their prices dramatically this week , desparate to move stock " at practically any price , " says the head of the retailers ' association handelsverband bag , johann hellwege .
even as prices drop , budget cuts are expected to start to bite in the coming months , and that means germans will have less money in their pockets to spend .
this is not good news for the country 's economic prospects .
unless consumer demand increases , businesses will not be able to invest , and the brakes will be applied once more .
fuel , meanwhile , has already become more expensive , as a result of the threat of war in the middle east , which has led opec to curb oil production , and strikes in venezuela .
germany 's biggest fuel company , aral / bp , is charging 1.05 euro -lrb- $ 1.10 -rrb- per liter for gas , and a new environment tax to be introduced on the first of january will send the price up by a further 3 to 5 cents .
unemployment rising the economic outlook for 2003 looks bleakest of all in germany 's eastern states .
unemployment , much higher than in the west , is at best expected to bottom out in the coming year .
economists have warned against drawing false conclusions from the higher growth forecasts in the east , which is still recovering from the devastating effects of the floods in 2002 .
in the country as a whole , the number of people out of work shot up to 4.22 million in december , the highest level in five years .
blaming seasonal factors and the long-term ill health of the economy , the government now forecasts a rise in the number of people without jobs to more than 4.5 million in february .
the latest forecast comes less than a week after the economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said he was confident unemployment would fall below 4 million in 2003 .

in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .
the company has not offered any proof but has said it will allow independent researchers to conduct genetic testing of the baby girl , named " eve , " in order to confirm its assertion .
there is currently no world-wide ban on human cloning , but it is forbidden in most countries .
experts warn that the consequences of cloning are incalculable - and the few successful attempts that have been undertaken have been riddled with genetic errors .
for example : dolly , the sheep cloned in 1997 , has developed early arthritis .
cloned mice live relatively short lives and become unusually overweight in their later years .
cloning researcher george seidel at colorado state university says the success rate in animal cloning is only two percent - meaning for every 50 animals cloned , only two would be successful .
" that may be acceptable for cattle , " he says , " but it 's surely not for human children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severino antinori the debate over the morality and ethics of human cloning has been roaring since italian doctor severino antinori -lrb- photo -rrb- announced , separately , in april that the first cloned baby would be born in january 2003 .
but doubt also looms over antinori 's claims .
" it is assumed worldwide that mr. antinori lacks the scientific capacity , " says markus montag , chairman of the german working group on human reproduction biology .
montag notes that current cloning technologies are inefficient and that researchers would need to use thousands of egg cells from hundreds of women .
" it 's hardly possible that antinori would be able to do something like that on the quiet , " he said .
seeking a global ban germany and france together introduced a proposal for a global ban on cloning humans for reproductive purposes at the united nations , but negotiations have been stalled until september 2003 under strong resistance from the united states , spain and the philippines , who thought the resolution was n't restrictive enough . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants u.n.-sponsored ban on cloning germany renewed calls for a worldwide ban on cloning following italian doctor severino antorini 's announcment this week that the first cloned baby could be born in january .

in the latest softening of its position on a possible war against iraq , germany 's foreign minister says it 's possible berlin will vote in favor of such action at the un - depending on the conditions . the german government is further distancing itself from a clear refusal to participate in a war against iraq .
foreign minister joschka fischer said this weekend the possibility could not be ruled out that germany would vote in favor of military action if faced with the decision at the u.n. security council .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .
1 .
no military participation in the interview , however , fischer reiterated the previous government position that germany would not send any soldiers into combat if war breaks out with iraq " if it is n't 100 percent convinced of the necessity of doing so . "
" what is certain is that we will not participate militarily in an intervention , " fischer told der spiegel .
it has become clear in recent weeks that it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in the event of an emergency .
since then , berlin has changed its tenor slightly .
the government has softened its refusal , saying it will not " actively " participate in a military action .
what it will do , however , is allow allies flyover rights and to use military bases located in germany in their actions .
diplomatic splits but the diplomatic situation for the federal government could get trickier come january , when a german representative participates in security council meetings .
hans blix , who is heading the un monitoring , verification and control commission in iraq , has until jan .
27 to declare whether or not iraq has fulfilled the tough weapons of mass destructions requirements set forth in un resolution 1441 .
at that point , the security council may consider taking military action against iraq .
if it does , germany could be forced to make a difficult decision .
then , in february , germany will become chair of the security council for a month , making the situation yet more difficult .
still , even fischer concedes the ultimate decision wo n't likely fall into german hands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.12.2002 german religious leaders , scientists condemn " frankenstein " clone doctors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an army of me ?
in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .
the company has not offered any proof but has said it will allow independent researchers to conduct genetic testing of the baby girl , named " eve , " in order to confirm its assertion .
there is currently no world-wide ban on human cloning , but it is forbidden in most countries .
experts warn that the consequences of cloning are incalculable - and the few successful attempts that have been undertaken have been riddled with genetic errors .
for example : dolly , the sheep cloned in 1997 , has developed early arthritis .
cloned mice live relatively short lives and become unusually overweight in their later years .
cloning researcher george seidel at colorado state university says the success rate in animal cloning is only two percent - meaning for every 50 animals cloned , only two would be successful .
" that may be acceptable for cattle , " he says , " but it 's surely not for human children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severino antinori the debate over the morality and ethics of human cloning has been roaring since italian doctor severino antinori -lrb- photo -rrb- announced , separately , in april that the first cloned baby would be born in january 2003 .
but doubt also looms over antinori 's claims .
" it is assumed worldwide that mr. antinori lacks the scientific capacity , " says markus montag , chairman of the german working group on human reproduction biology .
montag notes that current cloning technologies are inefficient and that researchers would need to use thousands of egg cells from hundreds of women .
" it 's hardly possible that antinori would be able to do something like that on the quiet , " he said .
seeking a global ban germany and france together introduced a proposal for a global ban on cloning humans for reproductive purposes at the united nations , but negotiations have been stalled until september 2003 under strong resistance from the united states , spain and the philippines , who thought the resolution was n't restrictive enough . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants u.n.-sponsored ban on cloning germany renewed calls for a worldwide ban on cloning following italian doctor severino antorini 's announcment this week that the first cloned baby could be born in january .

but they 're also saying the number of people out of work could reach 4.5 million next year .
so what 's the prognosis ? as the year comes to an end , germans are hoping they 'll be able to put what 's been an economic ' annus horribilis ' behind them .
europe 's leading economic power found the going in 2002 especially tough .
after the relatively smooth introduction of the euro as legal tender on jan .
1 , 2002 , the economy took a slow and determined dive from which it has yet to surface .
with the global economic forecast for 2003 looking slightly better , germany is hoping to feel the effects of a faster us-led recovery in the coming year .
but there still no firm indications that growth will be solid , and many people believe europe will be lucky to see any sort of rebound .
pessimism the prognoses for the germany economy in the coming year are mostly negative .
some studies suggest business confidence is at a 10-year low .
the director of the german economic institute , gerhard fels , says a survey of 44 employer organizations has shown that most businesses predict zero- or negative growth in the areas of turnover , investment and employment .
and industry leaders are pointing their fingers at the government 's soft approach to the unions , says fels .
germany 's retail sector is reeling after poor christmas sales .
shops have dropped their prices dramatically this week , desparate to move stock " at practically any price , " says the head of the retailers ' association handelsverband bag , johann hellwege .
even as prices drop , budget cuts are expected to start to bite in the coming months , and that means germans will have less money in their pockets to spend .
this is not good news for the country 's economic prospects .
unless consumer demand increases , businesses will not be able to invest , and the brakes will be applied once more .
fuel , meanwhile , has already become more expensive , as a result of the threat of war in the middle east , which has led opec to curb oil production , and strikes in venezuela .
germany 's biggest fuel company , aral / bp , is charging 1.05 euro -lrb- $ 1.10 -rrb- per liter for gas , and a new environment tax to be introduced on the first of january will send the price up by a further 3 to 5 cents .
unemployment rising the economic outlook for 2003 looks bleakest of all in germany 's eastern states .
unemployment , much higher than in the west , is at best expected to bottom out in the coming year .
economists have warned against drawing false conclusions from the higher growth forecasts in the east , which is still recovering from the devastating effects of the floods in 2002 .
in the country as a whole , the number of people out of work shot up to 4.22 million in december , the highest level in five years .
blaming seasonal factors and the long-term ill health of the economy , the government now forecasts a rise in the number of people without jobs to more than 4.5 million in february .
the latest forecast comes less than a week after the economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said he was confident unemployment would fall below 4 million in 2003 .
growth forecast unrealistic even if the pressure on europe 's economies eases slightly in 2003 , the change will not be dramatic .
experts are predicting the euro zone to expand by only 1.3 percent .
the german government has forecast 1.5 percent growth in 2003 .
but the european commission believes this is too optimistic .
it expects the euro zone 's leading economy to expand by no more than one percent next year .
this will mean the government wo n't be able to bring down its budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product as required by the european stability and growth pact , which ensures the stability of the euro .
seeing the brighter side despite the gloomy forecasts , optimists are also making their voices heard .
the president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , on friday called for the doomsday predictions to stop .
indeed , official figures for 2002 show germany 's economy stabilizing , after reaching its lowest point in the first quarter of the year .
that 's led some financial experts to predict improvement in the coming year , citing growing business confidence and expectations of the benefits to flow from the government 's labor reforms .
" the economy is looking to the future with more confidence , " financial consultant roland berger told germany 's bild newspaper .
" as long as industry is optimistic about the future , then we 'll start to see more investment and we 'll be creating more jobs , " said berger .
that 's backed up by figures which show that 38 percent of companies are expecting next year to be an improvement on 2002 , and a further 35 percent think the economic situation wo n't get worse .

but they 're also saying the number of people out of work could reach 4.5 million next year .
so what 's the prognosis ? as the year comes to an end , germans are hoping they 'll be able to put what 's been an economic ' annus horribilis ' behind them .
europe 's leading economic power found the going in 2002 especially tough .
after the relatively smooth introduction of the euro as legal tender on jan .
1 , 2002 , the economy took a slow and determined dive from which it has yet to surface .
with the global economic forecast for 2003 looking slightly better , germany is hoping to feel the effects of a faster us-led recovery in the coming year .
but there still no firm indications that growth will be solid , and many people believe europe will be lucky to see any sort of rebound .
pessimism the prognoses for the germany economy in the coming year are mostly negative .
some studies suggest business confidence is at a 10-year low .
the director of the german economic institute , gerhard fels , says a survey of 44 employer organizations has shown that most businesses predict zero- or negative growth in the areas of turnover , investment and employment .
and industry leaders are pointing their fingers at the government 's soft approach to the unions , says fels .
germany 's retail sector is reeling after poor christmas sales .
shops have dropped their prices dramatically this week , desparate to move stock " at practically any price , " says the head of the retailers ' association handelsverband bag , johann hellwege .
even as prices drop , budget cuts are expected to start to bite in the coming months , and that means germans will have less money in their pockets to spend .
this is not good news for the country 's economic prospects .
unless consumer demand increases , businesses will not be able to invest , and the brakes will be applied once more .
fuel , meanwhile , has already become more expensive , as a result of the threat of war in the middle east , which has led opec to curb oil production , and strikes in venezuela .
germany 's biggest fuel company , aral / bp , is charging 1.05 euro -lrb- $ 1.10 -rrb- per liter for gas , and a new environment tax to be introduced on the first of january will send the price up by a further 3 to 5 cents .

in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .
the company has not offered any proof but has said it will allow independent researchers to conduct genetic testing of the baby girl , named " eve , " in order to confirm its assertion .
there is currently no world-wide ban on human cloning , but it is forbidden in most countries .
experts warn that the consequences of cloning are incalculable - and the few successful attempts that have been undertaken have been riddled with genetic errors .
for example : dolly , the sheep cloned in 1997 , has developed early arthritis .
cloned mice live relatively short lives and become unusually overweight in their later years .
cloning researcher george seidel at colorado state university says the success rate in animal cloning is only two percent - meaning for every 50 animals cloned , only two would be successful .
" that may be acceptable for cattle , " he says , " but it 's surely not for human children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severino antinori the debate over the morality and ethics of human cloning has been roaring since italian doctor severino antinori -lrb- photo -rrb- announced , separately , in april that the first cloned baby would be born in january 2003 .
but doubt also looms over antinori 's claims .
" it is assumed worldwide that mr. antinori lacks the scientific capacity , " says markus montag , chairman of the german working group on human reproduction biology .
montag notes that current cloning technologies are inefficient and that researchers would need to use thousands of egg cells from hundreds of women .
" it 's hardly possible that antinori would be able to do something like that on the quiet , " he said .

in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .
the company has not offered any proof but has said it will allow independent researchers to conduct genetic testing of the baby girl , named " eve , " in order to confirm its assertion .
there is currently no world-wide ban on human cloning , but it is forbidden in most countries .
experts warn that the consequences of cloning are incalculable - and the few successful attempts that have been undertaken have been riddled with genetic errors .
for example : dolly , the sheep cloned in 1997 , has developed early arthritis .
cloned mice live relatively short lives and become unusually overweight in their later years .
cloning researcher george seidel at colorado state university says the success rate in animal cloning is only two percent - meaning for every 50 animals cloned , only two would be successful .
" that may be acceptable for cattle , " he says , " but it 's surely not for human children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severino antinori the debate over the morality and ethics of human cloning has been roaring since italian doctor severino antinori -lrb- photo -rrb- announced , separately , in april that the first cloned baby would be born in january 2003 .
but doubt also looms over antinori 's claims .
" it is assumed worldwide that mr. antinori lacks the scientific capacity , " says markus montag , chairman of the german working group on human reproduction biology .
montag notes that current cloning technologies are inefficient and that researchers would need to use thousands of egg cells from hundreds of women .
" it 's hardly possible that antinori would be able to do something like that on the quiet , " he said .
seeking a global ban germany and france together introduced a proposal for a global ban on cloning humans for reproductive purposes at the united nations , but negotiations have been stalled until september 2003 under strong resistance from the united states , spain and the philippines , who thought the resolution was n't restrictive enough . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants u.n.-sponsored ban on cloning germany renewed calls for a worldwide ban on cloning following italian doctor severino antorini 's announcment this week that the first cloned baby could be born in january .

in the latest softening of its position on a possible war against iraq , germany 's foreign minister says it 's possible berlin will vote in favor of such action at the un - depending on the conditions . the german government is further distancing itself from a clear refusal to participate in a war against iraq .
foreign minister joschka fischer said this weekend the possibility could not be ruled out that germany would vote in favor of military action if faced with the decision at the u.n. security council .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .

no military participation in the interview , however , fischer reiterated the previous government position that germany would not send any soldiers into combat if war breaks out with iraq " if it is n't 100 percent convinced of the necessity of doing so . "
" what is certain is that we will not participate militarily in an intervention , " fischer told der spiegel .
it has become clear in recent weeks that it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in the event of an emergency .
since then , berlin has changed its tenor slightly .
the government has softened its refusal , saying it will not " actively " participate in a military action .
what it will do , however , is allow allies flyover rights and to use military bases located in germany in their actions .
diplomatic splits but the diplomatic situation for the federal government could get trickier come january , when a german representative participates in security council meetings .
hans blix , who is heading the un monitoring , verification and control commission in iraq , has until jan .
27 to declare whether or not iraq has fulfilled the tough weapons of mass destructions requirements set forth in un resolution 1441 .
at that point , the security council may consider taking military action against iraq .
if it does , germany could be forced to make a difficult decision .
then , in february , germany will become chair of the security council for a month , making the situation yet more difficult .
still , even fischer concedes the ultimate decision wo n't likely fall into german hands .
" we 're not the decisive player here - that 's the five standing members who have veto rights , " he told der spiegel .

in the latest softening of its position on a possible war against iraq , germany 's foreign minister says it 's possible berlin will vote in favor of such action at the un - depending on the conditions . the german government is further distancing itself from a clear refusal to participate in a war against iraq .
foreign minister joschka fischer said this weekend the possibility could not be ruled out that germany would vote in favor of military action if faced with the decision at the u.n. security council .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .

no military participation in the interview , however , fischer reiterated the previous government position that germany would not send any soldiers into combat if war breaks out with iraq " if it is n't 100 percent convinced of the necessity of doing so . "
" what is certain is that we will not participate militarily in an intervention , " fischer told der spiegel .
it has become clear in recent weeks that it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in the event of an emergency .
since then , berlin has changed its tenor slightly .
the government has softened its refusal , saying it will not " actively " participate in a military action .
what it will do , however , is allow allies flyover rights and to use military bases located in germany in their actions .
diplomatic splits but the diplomatic situation for the federal government could get trickier come january , when a german representative participates in security council meetings .
hans blix , who is heading the un monitoring , verification and control commission in iraq , has until jan .
27 to declare whether or not iraq has fulfilled the tough weapons of mass destructions requirements set forth in un resolution 1441 .
at that point , the security council may consider taking military action against iraq .
if it does , germany could be forced to make a difficult decision .
then , in february , germany will become chair of the security council for a month , making the situation yet more difficult .
still , even fischer concedes the ultimate decision wo n't likely fall into german hands .
" we 're not the decisive player here - that 's the five standing members who have veto rights , " he told der spiegel .
and the chair position holds little by way of concrete power - most of its duties are related to mediation and organization . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?
germany will join the united nations security council team as a non-permanent member next year and head the sanctions committee on iraq , a position that could place it at odds with its own stated foreign policy .

but they 're also saying the number of people out of work could reach 4.5 million next year .
so what 's the prognosis ? as the year comes to an end , germans are hoping they 'll be able to put what 's been an economic ' annus horribilis ' behind them .
europe 's leading economic power found the going in 2002 especially tough .
after the relatively smooth introduction of the euro as legal tender on jan .
1 , 2002 , the economy took a slow and determined dive from which it has yet to surface .
with the global economic forecast for 2003 looking slightly better , germany is hoping to feel the effects of a faster us-led recovery in the coming year .
but there still no firm indications that growth will be solid , and many people believe europe will be lucky to see any sort of rebound .
pessimism the prognoses for the germany economy in the coming year are mostly negative .
some studies suggest business confidence is at a 10-year low .
the director of the german economic institute , gerhard fels , says a survey of 44 employer organizations has shown that most businesses predict zero- or negative growth in the areas of turnover , investment and employment .
and industry leaders are pointing their fingers at the government 's soft approach to the unions , says fels .
germany 's retail sector is reeling after poor christmas sales .
shops have dropped their prices dramatically this week , desparate to move stock " at practically any price , " says the head of the retailers ' association handelsverband bag , johann hellwege .
even as prices drop , budget cuts are expected to start to bite in the coming months , and that means germans will have less money in their pockets to spend .
this is not good news for the country 's economic prospects .
unless consumer demand increases , businesses will not be able to invest , and the brakes will be applied once more .
fuel , meanwhile , has already become more expensive , as a result of the threat of war in the middle east , which has led opec to curb oil production , and strikes in venezuela .
germany 's biggest fuel company , aral / bp , is charging 1.05 euro -lrb- $ 1.10 -rrb- per liter for gas , and a new environment tax to be introduced on the first of january will send the price up by a further 3 to 5 cents .
unemployment rising the economic outlook for 2003 looks bleakest of all in germany 's eastern states .
unemployment , much higher than in the west , is at best expected to bottom out in the coming year .
economists have warned against drawing false conclusions from the higher growth forecasts in the east , which is still recovering from the devastating effects of the floods in 2002 .
in the country as a whole , the number of people out of work shot up to 4.22 million in december , the highest level in five years .
blaming seasonal factors and the long-term ill health of the economy , the government now forecasts a rise in the number of people without jobs to more than 4.5 million in february .
the latest forecast comes less than a week after the economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said he was confident unemployment would fall below 4 million in 2003 .
growth forecast unrealistic even if the pressure on europe 's economies eases slightly in 2003 , the change will not be dramatic .
experts are predicting the euro zone to expand by only 1.3 percent .
the german government has forecast 1.5 percent growth in 2003 .
but the european commission believes this is too optimistic .
it expects the euro zone 's leading economy to expand by no more than one percent next year .
this will mean the government wo n't be able to bring down its budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product as required by the european stability and growth pact , which ensures the stability of the euro .
seeing the brighter side despite the gloomy forecasts , optimists are also making their voices heard .
the president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , on friday called for the doomsday predictions to stop .
indeed , official figures for 2002 show germany 's economy stabilizing , after reaching its lowest point in the first quarter of the year .
that 's led some financial experts to predict improvement in the coming year , citing growing business confidence and expectations of the benefits to flow from the government 's labor reforms .
" the economy is looking to the future with more confidence , " financial consultant roland berger told germany 's bild newspaper .
" as long as industry is optimistic about the future , then we 'll start to see more investment and we 'll be creating more jobs , " said berger .
that 's backed up by figures which show that 38 percent of companies are expecting next year to be an improvement on 2002 , and a further 35 percent think the economic situation wo n't get worse .

in the latest softening of its position on a possible war against iraq , germany 's foreign minister says it 's possible berlin will vote in favor of such action at the un - depending on the conditions . the german government is further distancing itself from a clear refusal to participate in a war against iraq .
foreign minister joschka fischer said this weekend the possibility could not be ruled out that germany would vote in favor of military action if faced with the decision at the u.n. security council .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .
1 .
no military participation in the interview , however , fischer reiterated the previous government position that germany would not send any soldiers into combat if war breaks out with iraq " if it is n't 100 percent convinced of the necessity of doing so . "
" what is certain is that we will not participate militarily in an intervention , " fischer told der spiegel .
it has become clear in recent weeks that it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in the event of an emergency .
since then , berlin has changed its tenor slightly .
the government has softened its refusal , saying it will not " actively " participate in a military action .
what it will do , however , is allow allies flyover rights and to use military bases located in germany in their actions .
diplomatic splits but the diplomatic situation for the federal government could get trickier come january , when a german representative participates in security council meetings .
hans blix , who is heading the un monitoring , verification and control commission in iraq , has until jan .
27 to declare whether or not iraq has fulfilled the tough weapons of mass destructions requirements set forth in un resolution 1441 .
at that point , the security council may consider taking military action against iraq .
if it does , germany could be forced to make a difficult decision .
then , in february , germany will become chair of the security council for a month , making the situation yet more difficult .
still , even fischer concedes the ultimate decision wo n't likely fall into german hands .
" we 're not the decisive player here - that 's the five standing members who have veto rights , " he told der spiegel .

in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .
the company has not offered any proof but has said it will allow independent researchers to conduct genetic testing of the baby girl , named " eve , " in order to confirm its assertion .
there is currently no world-wide ban on human cloning , but it is forbidden in most countries .
experts warn that the consequences of cloning are incalculable - and the few successful attempts that have been undertaken have been riddled with genetic errors .
for example : dolly , the sheep cloned in 1997 , has developed early arthritis .
cloned mice live relatively short lives and become unusually overweight in their later years .
cloning researcher george seidel at colorado state university says the success rate in animal cloning is only two percent - meaning for every 50 animals cloned , only two would be successful .
" that may be acceptable for cattle , " he says , " but it 's surely not for human children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severino antinori the debate over the morality and ethics of human cloning has been roaring since italian doctor severino antinori -lrb- photo -rrb- announced , separately , in april that the first cloned baby would be born in january 2003 .
but doubt also looms over antinori 's claims .
" it is assumed worldwide that mr. antinori lacks the scientific capacity , " says markus montag , chairman of the german working group on human reproduction biology .
montag notes that current cloning technologies are inefficient and that researchers would need to use thousands of egg cells from hundreds of women .
" it 's hardly possible that antinori would be able to do something like that on the quiet , " he said .
seeking a global ban germany and france together introduced a proposal for a global ban on cloning humans for reproductive purposes at the united nations , but negotiations have been stalled until september 2003 under strong resistance from the united states , spain and the philippines , who thought the resolution was n't restrictive enough . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants u.n.-sponsored ban on cloning germany renewed calls for a worldwide ban on cloning following italian doctor severino antorini 's announcment this week that the first cloned baby could be born in january .

in the latest softening of its position on a possible war against iraq , germany 's foreign minister says it 's possible berlin will vote in favor of such action at the un - depending on the conditions . the german government is further distancing itself from a clear refusal to participate in a war against iraq .
foreign minister joschka fischer said this weekend the possibility could not be ruled out that germany would vote in favor of military action if faced with the decision at the u.n. security council .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .
1 .
no military participation in the interview , however , fischer reiterated the previous government position that germany would not send any soldiers into combat if war breaks out with iraq " if it is n't 100 percent convinced of the necessity of doing so . "
" what is certain is that we will not participate militarily in an intervention , " fischer told der spiegel .
it has become clear in recent weeks that it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in the event of an emergency .
since then , berlin has changed its tenor slightly .
the government has softened its refusal , saying it will not " actively " participate in a military action .
what it will do , however , is allow allies flyover rights and to use military bases located in germany in their actions .
diplomatic splits but the diplomatic situation for the federal government could get trickier come january , when a german representative participates in security council meetings .
hans blix , who is heading the un monitoring , verification and control commission in iraq , has until jan .
27 to declare whether or not iraq has fulfilled the tough weapons of mass destructions requirements set forth in un resolution 1441 .
at that point , the security council may consider taking military action against iraq .
if it does , germany could be forced to make a difficult decision .
then , in february , germany will become chair of the security council for a month , making the situation yet more difficult .
still , even fischer concedes the ultimate decision wo n't likely fall into german hands .
" we 're not the decisive player here - that 's the five standing members who have veto rights , " he told der spiegel .
and the chair position holds little by way of concrete power - most of its duties are related to mediation and organization . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are germany 's new un obligations a migraine mandate ?

in the wake of the alleged birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby , scientists and religious leaders in germany call for a global ban on human cloning . german scientists , politicians and churches have strongly criticized claims by an american company that a woman gave birth to the world 's first cloned baby on thursday and say they are skeptical of the veracity of the claim .
the chairman of the council of protestant churches in germany , manfred kock , described the development as " crossing the line , " saying the cloning of humans was " morally reprehensible and absurd medically . "
paving the way for " frankenstein horror doctors " taking specific aim at clonaid , the company linked to the raelian ufo religious sect - whose primary belief is that humans were created by aliens - kock said the world needed no " frankenstein horror doctors who create cloned humans but rather responsible doctors who cure illnesses . "
spiros simitis , head of germany 's national ethics council which advises the government on stem-cell research policies , said the production of a cloned human is " completely irresponsible . "
meanwhile , dfg , the german research foundation , repeated its statement that reproductive and therapeutic cloning of humans is " highly morally reprehensible " and called for a global ban on human cloning .
the organization said it did not believe clonaid 's claim , but that if it were true it would be " fully irresponsible - both scientifically and morally . "
dfg spokeswoman eva-maria streier told the german protestant news agency epd that scientists here had serious doubts about the veracity of clonaid 's announcement , saying cloning technology is not yet sophisticated enough for the replication of humans .
she noted that it took 286 attempts to get the sheep pregnant that carried the clone " dolly . "
the research organization also warned that attempts to clone humans would likely lead to the birth of " many handicapped children . "
the german bishops conference has decried the cloning of human beings as " one of the most condemnable violations against human dignity . "
and the initiative stop pid and cloning -lrb- for pre-implantations and cloning -rrb- has stated its concern that the sole purpose of cloned humans would be to use them as " raw materials for healing the originals . "
and hans van der ven , a prominent reproductive doctor at the university of bonn , has decried cloning as an " irresponsible experiment with human life . "
a raging debate on friday , clonaid researcher brigitte boisselier announced in florida the birth of the world 's first-ever clone baby .
the company has not offered any proof but has said it will allow independent researchers to conduct genetic testing of the baby girl , named " eve , " in order to confirm its assertion .
there is currently no world-wide ban on human cloning , but it is forbidden in most countries .
experts warn that the consequences of cloning are incalculable - and the few successful attempts that have been undertaken have been riddled with genetic errors .
for example : dolly , the sheep cloned in 1997 , has developed early arthritis .
cloned mice live relatively short lives and become unusually overweight in their later years .
cloning researcher george seidel at colorado state university says the success rate in animal cloning is only two percent - meaning for every 50 animals cloned , only two would be successful .
" that may be acceptable for cattle , " he says , " but it 's surely not for human children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : severino antinori the debate over the morality and ethics of human cloning has been roaring since italian doctor severino antinori -lrb- photo -rrb- announced , separately , in april that the first cloned baby would be born in january 2003 .
but doubt also looms over antinori 's claims .
" it is assumed worldwide that mr. antinori lacks the scientific capacity , " says markus montag , chairman of the german working group on human reproduction biology .
montag notes that current cloning technologies are inefficient and that researchers would need to use thousands of egg cells from hundreds of women .
" it 's hardly possible that antinori would be able to do something like that on the quiet , " he said .
seeking a global ban germany and france together introduced a proposal for a global ban on cloning humans for reproductive purposes at the united nations , but negotiations have been stalled until september 2003 under strong resistance from the united states , spain and the philippines , who thought the resolution was n't restrictive enough . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants u.n.-sponsored ban on cloning germany renewed calls for a worldwide ban on cloning following italian doctor severino antorini 's announcment this week that the first cloned baby could be born in january .

but they 're also saying the number of people out of work could reach 4.5 million next year .
so what 's the prognosis ? as the year comes to an end , germans are hoping they 'll be able to put what 's been an economic ' annus horribilis ' behind them .
europe 's leading economic power found the going in 2002 especially tough .
after the relatively smooth introduction of the euro as legal tender on jan .
1 , 2002 , the economy took a slow and determined dive from which it has yet to surface .
with the global economic forecast for 2003 looking slightly better , germany is hoping to feel the effects of a faster us-led recovery in the coming year .
but there still no firm indications that growth will be solid , and many people believe europe will be lucky to see any sort of rebound .
pessimism the prognoses for the germany economy in the coming year are mostly negative .
some studies suggest business confidence is at a 10-year low .
the director of the german economic institute , gerhard fels , says a survey of 44 employer organizations has shown that most businesses predict zero- or negative growth in the areas of turnover , investment and employment .
and industry leaders are pointing their fingers at the government 's soft approach to the unions , says fels .
germany 's retail sector is reeling after poor christmas sales .
shops have dropped their prices dramatically this week , desparate to move stock " at practically any price , " says the head of the retailers ' association handelsverband bag , johann hellwege .
even as prices drop , budget cuts are expected to start to bite in the coming months , and that means germans will have less money in their pockets to spend .
this is not good news for the country 's economic prospects .
unless consumer demand increases , businesses will not be able to invest , and the brakes will be applied once more .
fuel , meanwhile , has already become more expensive , as a result of the threat of war in the middle east , which has led opec to curb oil production , and strikes in venezuela .
germany 's biggest fuel company , aral / bp , is charging 1.05 euro -lrb- $ 1.10 -rrb- per liter for gas , and a new environment tax to be introduced on the first of january will send the price up by a further 3 to 5 cents .
unemployment rising the economic outlook for 2003 looks bleakest of all in germany 's eastern states .
unemployment , much higher than in the west , is at best expected to bottom out in the coming year .
economists have warned against drawing false conclusions from the higher growth forecasts in the east , which is still recovering from the devastating effects of the floods in 2002 .
in the country as a whole , the number of people out of work shot up to 4.22 million in december , the highest level in five years .
blaming seasonal factors and the long-term ill health of the economy , the government now forecasts a rise in the number of people without jobs to more than 4.5 million in february .
the latest forecast comes less than a week after the economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said he was confident unemployment would fall below 4 million in 2003 .
growth forecast unrealistic even if the pressure on europe 's economies eases slightly in 2003 , the change will not be dramatic .
experts are predicting the euro zone to expand by only 1.3 percent .
the german government has forecast 1.5 percent growth in 2003 .
but the european commission believes this is too optimistic .
it expects the euro zone 's leading economy to expand by no more than one percent next year .
this will mean the government wo n't be able to bring down its budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product as required by the european stability and growth pact , which ensures the stability of the euro .
seeing the brighter side despite the gloomy forecasts , optimists are also making their voices heard .
the president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , on friday called for the doomsday predictions to stop .
indeed , official figures for 2002 show germany 's economy stabilizing , after reaching its lowest point in the first quarter of the year .

it expects the euro zone 's leading economy to expand by no more than one percent next year .
this will mean the government wo n't be able to bring down its budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product as required by the european stability and growth pact , which ensures the stability of the euro .
seeing the brighter side despite the gloomy forecasts , optimists are also making their voices heard .
the president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , on friday called for the doomsday predictions to stop .
indeed , official figures for 2002 show germany 's economy stabilizing , after reaching its lowest point in the first quarter of the year .
that 's led some financial experts to predict improvement in the coming year , citing growing business confidence and expectations of the benefits to flow from the government 's labor reforms .
" the economy is looking to the future with more confidence , " financial consultant roland berger told germany 's bild newspaper .
" as long as industry is optimistic about the future , then we 'll start to see more investment and we 'll be creating more jobs , " said berger .
that 's backed up by figures which show that 38 percent of companies are expecting next year to be an improvement on 2002 , and a further 35 percent think the economic situation wo n't get worse .

in the latest softening of its position on a possible war against iraq , germany 's foreign minister says it 's possible berlin will vote in favor of such action at the un - depending on the conditions . the german government is further distancing itself from a clear refusal to participate in a war against iraq .
foreign minister joschka fischer said this weekend the possibility could not be ruled out that germany would vote in favor of military action if faced with the decision at the u.n. security council .
" nobody can predict the german vote at the security council , " fischer said in an interview with the newsweekly der spiegel , " because nobody knows how and under which circumstances the security council will deal with it . "
the statement comes as germany prepares to become a non-standing member of the united nations security council on jan .
1 .
no military participation in the interview , however , fischer reiterated the previous government position that germany would not send any soldiers into combat if war breaks out with iraq " if it is n't 100 percent convinced of the necessity of doing so . "
" what is certain is that we will not participate militarily in an intervention , " fischer told der spiegel .
it has become clear in recent weeks that it has become increasingly difficult for the german government to maintain its absolute refusal to act against iraq .
in november , both israel and the united states asked germany for its support in the event of an emergency .
since then , berlin has changed its tenor slightly .
the government has softened its refusal , saying it will not " actively " participate in a military action .
what it will do , however , is allow allies flyover rights and to use military bases located in germany in their actions .
diplomatic splits but the diplomatic situation for the federal government could get trickier come january , when a german representative participates in security council meetings .
hans blix , who is heading the un monitoring , verification and control commission in iraq , has until jan .
27 to declare whether or not iraq has fulfilled the tough weapons of mass destructions requirements set forth in un resolution 1441 .
at that point , the security council may consider taking military action against iraq .
if it does , germany could be forced to make a difficult decision .
then , in february , germany will become chair of the security council for a month , making the situation yet more difficult .
still , even fischer concedes the ultimate decision wo n't likely fall into german hands .
" we 're not the decisive player here - that 's the five standing members who have veto rights , " he told der spiegel .

germany 's biggest fuel company , aral / bp , is charging 1.05 euro -lrb- $ 1.10 -rrb- per liter for gas , and a new environment tax to be introduced on the first of january will send the price up by a further 3 to 5 cents .
unemployment rising the economic outlook for 2003 looks bleakest of all in germany 's eastern states .
unemployment , much higher than in the west , is at best expected to bottom out in the coming year .
economists have warned against drawing false conclusions from the higher growth forecasts in the east , which is still recovering from the devastating effects of the floods in 2002 .
in the country as a whole , the number of people out of work shot up to 4.22 million in december , the highest level in five years .
blaming seasonal factors and the long-term ill health of the economy , the government now forecasts a rise in the number of people without jobs to more than 4.5 million in february .
the latest forecast comes less than a week after the economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said he was confident unemployment would fall below 4 million in 2003 .
growth forecast unrealistic even if the pressure on europe 's economies eases slightly in 2003 , the change will not be dramatic .
experts are predicting the euro zone to expand by only 1.3 percent .
the german government has forecast 1.5 percent growth in 2003 .
but the european commission believes this is too optimistic .
it expects the euro zone 's leading economy to expand by no more than one percent next year .
this will mean the government wo n't be able to bring down its budget deficit below 3 percent of gross domestic product as required by the european stability and growth pact , which ensures the stability of the euro .
seeing the brighter side despite the gloomy forecasts , optimists are also making their voices heard .
the president of the german parliament , wolfgang thierse , on friday called for the doomsday predictions to stop .
indeed , official figures for 2002 show germany 's economy stabilizing , after reaching its lowest point in the first quarter of the year .
that 's led some financial experts to predict improvement in the coming year , citing growing business confidence and expectations of the benefits to flow from the government 's labor reforms .
" the economy is looking to the future with more confidence , " financial consultant roland berger told germany 's bild newspaper .
" as long as industry is optimistic about the future , then we 'll start to see more investment and we 'll be creating more jobs , " said berger .
that 's backed up by figures which show that 38 percent of companies are expecting next year to be an improvement on 2002 , and a further 35 percent think the economic situation wo n't get worse .

by david chazan bbc correspondent the raelian movement is the founder of the clonaid company which claims to have produced the first cloned baby .
the movement claims to have about 40,000 members in several countries , although the number is difficult to verify .
the sect , which believes humans were created by extra-terrestrial beings who had mastered genetic engineering , was founded in france in 1973 by a former journalist who worked for a racing car magazine .
one december morning in 1973 , journalist claude vorilhon was on his way to work in the french provincial town of clermont-ferrand .
but - according to a book written by mr vorilhon , who is now known as rael - instead of going to the office , on an impulse , he drove to a nearby volcano .
international movement there , he says , he was contacted by an extra-terrestrial being who emerged from a flying saucer and told him - in fluent french - that humans were created in laboratories by people from another planet .
the creators were known as the elohim - a word which , in ancient hebrew , meant " those who came from the sky " .
it is used in jewish prayers to refer to god .
mr vorilhon was told to spread the word of the elohim on earth in preparation for their return .
he describes them as being little over a metre in height , with pale green skin , almond-shaped eyes and long dark hair .
since then the raelians have grown into an international movement .
rael himself has reportedly relocated to the united states after complaining of harassment by the french authorities .
eternal life the raelians ' interest in cloning seems to stem from their belief that the human soul perishes when the body dies .
therefore , they believe , the key to eternal life is not the soul but the recreation of individuals from their dna .
in 1997 , the group founded clonaid , which now says it has cloned a human being .
in 1990 , the raelians changed their symbol , originally a swastika inside a star of david .
the idea was to improve relations with israel and persuade the government there to let them build an embassy for the elohim in jerusalem .
