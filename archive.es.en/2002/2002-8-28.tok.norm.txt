but what has happened to the lofty promises made at rio ?
has the global environment changed for the better in the past ten years ? critical voices even before start of summit despite the sheer scale of the johannesburg summit , some fear this year 's conference wo n't bear as much fruit as its predecessor in rio .
" the earth summit -lrb- in rio -rrb- was a success because it put the environment on the global political map , it made key policy decisions and set up institutions to start to deliver them , " said jamie pittock of the world wildlife fund .
he cites the framework conventions on climate change and biological diversity as examples .
" we would all have liked progress to have been more rapid in the past decade , but the fact that we have those agreements and that those conventions are gradually being implemented is a success , " he said .
considerable achievements at rio to begin with , the earth summit established the rio declaration , a set of 27 principles defining the rights and responsibilities of the states in regard to the environment .
this was designed to be a global environmental bill of rights .
the rio declaration has been hailed as being progressive by green groups , but has been largely forgotten in favour of agenda 21 .
agenda 21 is a 40 chapter blueprint outlining a plan of action for sustainable development .
it contains over 2,500 recommendations - including detailed proposals on how to reduce wasteful consumption patterns , combat poverty , protect the atmosphere , oceans and bio-diversity and promote sustainable agriculture .
agenda 21 was unique in that it was not restricted to national governments .
6,000 cities and towns adopted the proposals in a practical translation of the " think globally and act locally " idea .
environmentalists fault agenda 21 however , the plan was criticised by environmentalists who said agenda 21 was a vague setof goals lacking clear implementation plans and binding legal requirements .
" positive direction decisions that have resulted from the rio summit have put the world in a slightly better direction than we would be in if these agreements had never been made , " said daniel mittler , an organizer for friends of the earth summit .
" but there have also been a lot of failures .
the picture we see is still dramatic and agenda 21 has clearly not lived up to being a blueprint for a sustainable planet which it was billed to be in 1992 . "
landmark bio- diversity convention born in rio nonetheless , the ideas for two major united nations conventions were born out of rio - the convention on biological diversity and the convention on climate change which led to the kyoto protocol .
the biological diversity convention has been ratified by 183 nations and came into effect in 1993 .
it obliges countries to protect plant and animal species from extinction through habitat preservation and other means .
but its implementation record remains poor .
half the world 's wetlands have been destroyed , most of them in the decade since rio , and 12 percent of bird species alone are threatened with extinction .
" between 1980 and 1995 , for example , the extent of the world 's forests decreased by an area roughly the size of mexico , " said mittler .
" so the fact that we have a global agreement on bio-diversity has n't prevented the loss of bio-diversity globally .
in 2000 , the world conservation union concluded that the extent of the world 's estimated 11,000 threatened species are critically endangered .
that means we are about to lose them . "
genesis of climate change convention in rio the framework convention on climate change was the highest profile agreement to emerge from the rio summit .
it led to the signing of the kyoto protocol - a legally binding treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below the levels emitted in 1990 .
for kyoto to come into force , 55 countries representing 55 percent of the industrialised countries have to make the treaty part of their domestic law .
only japan and the european union have ratified the kyoto protocol .
and the united states - the largest single air polluter - has rejected the treaty outright saying it is unfair as it excludes developing countries .
" if it is true that man-made emissions are contributing to climate change and that we need to try to remedy that , then the kyoto protocol is not an adequate vehicle to get there , " said margot thorning , the chief economist at the council for capital formation in washington .
" it wo n't really materially reduce the growth of greenhouse gases because the new emitters of greenhouse gases where the greenhouse gases are going up sharply - like india , china , brazil , indonesia and other parts of the world - are not constrained in terms of how fast their greenhouse gas emissions grow . "
humans responsible for climate change ?
in the ten years since rio global emissions of carbon – widely accepted as causing global warming - have increased by 400 million tonnes .
in other words , global emissions have risen by 9 percent rather than decreasing by the roughly 7 percent target set by the kyoto protocol .
and 2002 is becoming the second warmest year ever since accurate records were kept in the 1850s .
david griggs from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said that there is no doubt that the world ’ s climate has changed . "
the global temperature has increased by 0.6 degrees , sea level has risen between 10 and 20 centimetres over the last 100 years , sea ice has retreated , arctic ice has retreated , glaciers have retreated .
the number of indicators that climate has changed are just so many .
what is much more difficult to assess is whether human beings are causing that . "
he said the ipcc after a careful assessment of observations , models and future projections has concluded that it is likely that most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is due to human influence .
depleting forest cover the world ’ s forests also figured at the rio summit and it was decided to create a foundation for an international convention on forests .
an intergovernmental panel on forests was established and adopted over one hundred action proposals .
yet until now no legal framework has been established .
in the meanwhile forest cover has been disappearing at an alarming rate .
between 1985 and 1995 an area as large as mexico was deforested .
in 2000 the un food and agriculture organisation fao cites a global loss of forested area of 2.2 percent .
but according to the world resources institute that estimate could be conservative as it includes plantation forests .
wri 's own estimates which exclude these plantation forests would double the natural forest loss in tropical asia and temperate latin america .
johannesburg : just talk and no action ?
as all eyes turn to the johannesburg summit next week , the united nations is eager to quell critical voices suggesting that johannesburg will be nothing more than a voluble conference resulting in little .
jan pronk , the united nations special envoy to the summit , said " we have too many summits , too many talking shops , and that 's the reason why at this particular conference we have to concentrate on agreements to act .
otherwise such conferences would n't make much sense anymore .
we should n't decide to come back in another five years , because we run from one conference to the other .
we should n't come back until 2015 because that is the time span for action on the basis of the agreements of the last decade . "
the un 's draft plan for implementation which will be discussed at johannesburg is already criticised by environment groups for being too weak .
they argue for johannesburg to succeed there need to be firm targets , financial commitments to meet these goals and enforcement mechanisms to implement them .
germany 's former environment minister and the head of the united nations environment programme , klaus töpfer , agrees .
" ten years before gave us clear and wonderful visionary texts and declarations .
but unluckily it was not integrated enough how to implement this and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not another declaration .

" positive direction decisions that have resulted from the rio summit have put the world in a slightly better direction than we would be in if these agreements had never been made , " said daniel mittler , an organizer for friends of the earth summit .
" but there have also been a lot of failures .
the picture we see is still dramatic and agenda 21 has clearly not lived up to being a blueprint for a sustainable planet which it was billed to be in 1992 . "
landmark bio- diversity convention born in rio nonetheless , the ideas for two major united nations conventions were born out of rio - the convention on biological diversity and the convention on climate change which led to the kyoto protocol .
the biological diversity convention has been ratified by 183 nations and came into effect in 1993 .
it obliges countries to protect plant and animal species from extinction through habitat preservation and other means .
but its implementation record remains poor .
half the world 's wetlands have been destroyed , most of them in the decade since rio , and 12 percent of bird species alone are threatened with extinction .
" between 1980 and 1995 , for example , the extent of the world 's forests decreased by an area roughly the size of mexico , " said mittler .
" so the fact that we have a global agreement on bio-diversity has n't prevented the loss of bio-diversity globally .
in 2000 , the world conservation union concluded that the extent of the world 's estimated 11,000 threatened species are critically endangered .
that means we are about to lose them . "
genesis of climate change convention in rio the framework convention on climate change was the highest profile agreement to emerge from the rio summit .
it led to the signing of the kyoto protocol - a legally binding treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below the levels emitted in 1990 .
for kyoto to come into force , 55 countries representing 55 percent of the industrialised countries have to make the treaty part of their domestic law .
only japan and the european union have ratified the kyoto protocol .
and the united states - the largest single air polluter - has rejected the treaty outright saying it is unfair as it excludes developing countries .
" if it is true that man-made emissions are contributing to climate change and that we need to try to remedy that , then the kyoto protocol is not an adequate vehicle to get there , " said margot thorning , the chief economist at the council for capital formation in washington .
" it wo n't really materially reduce the growth of greenhouse gases because the new emitters of greenhouse gases where the greenhouse gases are going up sharply - like india , china , brazil , indonesia and other parts of the world - are not constrained in terms of how fast their greenhouse gas emissions grow . "
humans responsible for climate change ?
in the ten years since rio global emissions of carbon – widely accepted as causing global warming - have increased by 400 million tonnes .
in other words , global emissions have risen by 9 percent rather than decreasing by the roughly 7 percent target set by the kyoto protocol .
and 2002 is becoming the second warmest year ever since accurate records were kept in the 1850s .
david griggs from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said that there is no doubt that the world ’ s climate has changed . "
the global temperature has increased by 0.6 degrees , sea level has risen between 10 and 20 centimetres over the last 100 years , sea ice has retreated , arctic ice has retreated , glaciers have retreated .
the number of indicators that climate has changed are just so many .
what is much more difficult to assess is whether human beings are causing that . "
he said the ipcc after a careful assessment of observations , models and future projections has concluded that it is likely that most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is due to human influence .
depleting forest cover the world ’ s forests also figured at the rio summit and it was decided to create a foundation for an international convention on forests .
an intergovernmental panel on forests was established and adopted over one hundred action proposals .
yet until now no legal framework has been established .
in the meanwhile forest cover has been disappearing at an alarming rate .
between 1985 and 1995 an area as large as mexico was deforested .
in 2000 the un food and agriculture organisation fao cites a global loss of forested area of 2.2 percent .
but according to the world resources institute that estimate could be conservative as it includes plantation forests .
wri 's own estimates which exclude these plantation forests would double the natural forest loss in tropical asia and temperate latin america .
johannesburg : just talk and no action ?
as all eyes turn to the johannesburg summit next week , the united nations is eager to quell critical voices suggesting that johannesburg will be nothing more than a voluble conference resulting in little .
jan pronk , the united nations special envoy to the summit , said " we have too many summits , too many talking shops , and that 's the reason why at this particular conference we have to concentrate on agreements to act .
otherwise such conferences would n't make much sense anymore .
we should n't decide to come back in another five years , because we run from one conference to the other .
we should n't come back until 2015 because that is the time span for action on the basis of the agreements of the last decade . "
the un 's draft plan for implementation which will be discussed at johannesburg is already criticised by environment groups for being too weak .
they argue for johannesburg to succeed there need to be firm targets , financial commitments to meet these goals and enforcement mechanisms to implement them .
germany 's former environment minister and the head of the united nations environment programme , klaus töpfer , agrees .
" ten years before gave us clear and wonderful visionary texts and declarations .
but unluckily it was not integrated enough how to implement this and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not another declaration .

he cites the framework conventions on climate change and biological diversity as examples .
" we would all have liked progress to have been more rapid in the past decade , but the fact that we have those agreements and that those conventions are gradually being implemented is a success , " he said .

david griggs from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said that there is no doubt that the world ’ s climate has changed . "
the global temperature has increased by 0.6 degrees , sea level has risen between 10 and 20 centimetres over the last 100 years , sea ice has retreated , arctic ice has retreated , glaciers have retreated .
the number of indicators that climate has changed are just so many .
what is much more difficult to assess is whether human beings are causing that . "
he said the ipcc after a careful assessment of observations , models and future projections has concluded that it is likely that most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is due to human influence .
depleting forest cover the world ’ s forests also figured at the rio summit and it was decided to create a foundation for an international convention on forests .
an intergovernmental panel on forests was established and adopted over one hundred action proposals .
yet until now no legal framework has been established .
in the meanwhile forest cover has been disappearing at an alarming rate .
between 1985 and 1995 an area as large as mexico was deforested .
in 2000 the un food and agriculture organisation fao cites a global loss of forested area of 2.2 percent .
but according to the world resources institute that estimate could be conservative as it includes plantation forests .
wri 's own estimates which exclude these plantation forests would double the natural forest loss in tropical asia and temperate latin america .
johannesburg : just talk and no action ?
as all eyes turn to the johannesburg summit next week , the united nations is eager to quell critical voices suggesting that johannesburg will be nothing more than a voluble conference resulting in little .
jan pronk , the united nations special envoy to the summit , said " we have too many summits , too many talking shops , and that 's the reason why at this particular conference we have to concentrate on agreements to act .
otherwise such conferences would n't make much sense anymore .
we should n't decide to come back in another five years , because we run from one conference to the other .
we should n't come back until 2015 because that is the time span for action on the basis of the agreements of the last decade . "
the un 's draft plan for implementation which will be discussed at johannesburg is already criticised by environment groups for being too weak .
they argue for johannesburg to succeed there need to be firm targets , financial commitments to meet these goals and enforcement mechanisms to implement them .
germany 's former environment minister and the head of the united nations environment programme , klaus töpfer , agrees .
" ten years before gave us clear and wonderful visionary texts and declarations .
but unluckily it was not integrated enough how to implement this and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not another declaration .

but what has happened to the lofty promises made at rio ?
has the global environment changed for the better in the past ten years ? critical voices even before start of summit despite the sheer scale of the johannesburg summit , some fear this year 's conference wo n't bear as much fruit as its predecessor in rio .
" the earth summit -lrb- in rio -rrb- was a success because it put the environment on the global political map , it made key policy decisions and set up institutions to start to deliver them , " said jamie pittock of the world wildlife fund .
he cites the framework conventions on climate change and biological diversity as examples .
" we would all have liked progress to have been more rapid in the past decade , but the fact that we have those agreements and that those conventions are gradually being implemented is a success , " he said .
considerable achievements at rio to begin with , the earth summit established the rio declaration , a set of 27 principles defining the rights and responsibilities of the states in regard to the environment .
this was designed to be a global environmental bill of rights .
the rio declaration has been hailed as being progressive by green groups , but has been largely forgotten in favour of agenda 21 .
agenda 21 is a 40 chapter blueprint outlining a plan of action for sustainable development .
it contains over 2,500 recommendations - including detailed proposals on how to reduce wasteful consumption patterns , combat poverty , protect the atmosphere , oceans and bio-diversity and promote sustainable agriculture .
agenda 21 was unique in that it was not restricted to national governments .
6,000 cities and towns adopted the proposals in a practical translation of the " think globally and act locally " idea .
environmentalists fault agenda 21 however , the plan was criticised by environmentalists who said agenda 21 was a vague setof goals lacking clear implementation plans and binding legal requirements .
" positive direction decisions that have resulted from the rio summit have put the world in a slightly better direction than we would be in if these agreements had never been made , " said daniel mittler , an organizer for friends of the earth summit .
" but there have also been a lot of failures .
the picture we see is still dramatic and agenda 21 has clearly not lived up to being a blueprint for a sustainable planet which it was billed to be in 1992 . "
landmark bio- diversity convention born in rio nonetheless , the ideas for two major united nations conventions were born out of rio - the convention on biological diversity and the convention on climate change which led to the kyoto protocol .
the biological diversity convention has been ratified by 183 nations and came into effect in 1993 .
it obliges countries to protect plant and animal species from extinction through habitat preservation and other means .
but its implementation record remains poor .
half the world 's wetlands have been destroyed , most of them in the decade since rio , and 12 percent of bird species alone are threatened with extinction .
" between 1980 and 1995 , for example , the extent of the world 's forests decreased by an area roughly the size of mexico , " said mittler .
" so the fact that we have a global agreement on bio-diversity has n't prevented the loss of bio-diversity globally .
in 2000 , the world conservation union concluded that the extent of the world 's estimated 11,000 threatened species are critically endangered .
that means we are about to lose them . "
genesis of climate change convention in rio the framework convention on climate change was the highest profile agreement to emerge from the rio summit .
it led to the signing of the kyoto protocol - a legally binding treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below the levels emitted in 1990 .
for kyoto to come into force , 55 countries representing 55 percent of the industrialised countries have to make the treaty part of their domestic law .
only japan and the european union have ratified the kyoto protocol .
and the united states - the largest single air polluter - has rejected the treaty outright saying it is unfair as it excludes developing countries .
" if it is true that man-made emissions are contributing to climate change and that we need to try to remedy that , then the kyoto protocol is not an adequate vehicle to get there , " said margot thorning , the chief economist at the council for capital formation in washington .
" it wo n't really materially reduce the growth of greenhouse gases because the new emitters of greenhouse gases where the greenhouse gases are going up sharply - like india , china , brazil , indonesia and other parts of the world - are not constrained in terms of how fast their greenhouse gas emissions grow . "
humans responsible for climate change ?
in the ten years since rio global emissions of carbon – widely accepted as causing global warming - have increased by 400 million tonnes .
in other words , global emissions have risen by 9 percent rather than decreasing by the roughly 7 percent target set by the kyoto protocol .
and 2002 is becoming the second warmest year ever since accurate records were kept in the 1850s .

but what has happened to the lofty promises made at rio ?
has the global environment changed for the better in the past ten years ? critical voices even before start of summit despite the sheer scale of the johannesburg summit , some fear this year 's conference wo n't bear as much fruit as its predecessor in rio .
" the earth summit -lrb- in rio -rrb- was a success because it put the environment on the global political map , it made key policy decisions and set up institutions to start to deliver them , " said jamie pittock of the world wildlife fund .
he cites the framework conventions on climate change and biological diversity as examples .
" we would all have liked progress to have been more rapid in the past decade , but the fact that we have those agreements and that those conventions are gradually being implemented is a success , " he said .
considerable achievements at rio to begin with , the earth summit established the rio declaration , a set of 27 principles defining the rights and responsibilities of the states in regard to the environment .
this was designed to be a global environmental bill of rights .
the rio declaration has been hailed as being progressive by green groups , but has been largely forgotten in favour of agenda 21 .
agenda 21 is a 40 chapter blueprint outlining a plan of action for sustainable development .
it contains over 2,500 recommendations - including detailed proposals on how to reduce wasteful consumption patterns , combat poverty , protect the atmosphere , oceans and bio-diversity and promote sustainable agriculture .
agenda 21 was unique in that it was not restricted to national governments .
6,000 cities and towns adopted the proposals in a practical translation of the " think globally and act locally " idea .
environmentalists fault agenda 21 however , the plan was criticised by environmentalists who said agenda 21 was a vague setof goals lacking clear implementation plans and binding legal requirements .
" positive direction decisions that have resulted from the rio summit have put the world in a slightly better direction than we would be in if these agreements had never been made , " said daniel mittler , an organizer for friends of the earth summit .
" but there have also been a lot of failures .
the picture we see is still dramatic and agenda 21 has clearly not lived up to being a blueprint for a sustainable planet which it was billed to be in 1992 . "
landmark bio- diversity convention born in rio nonetheless , the ideas for two major united nations conventions were born out of rio - the convention on biological diversity and the convention on climate change which led to the kyoto protocol .
the biological diversity convention has been ratified by 183 nations and came into effect in 1993 .
it obliges countries to protect plant and animal species from extinction through habitat preservation and other means .
but its implementation record remains poor .
half the world 's wetlands have been destroyed , most of them in the decade since rio , and 12 percent of bird species alone are threatened with extinction .
" between 1980 and 1995 , for example , the extent of the world 's forests decreased by an area roughly the size of mexico , " said mittler .
" so the fact that we have a global agreement on bio-diversity has n't prevented the loss of bio-diversity globally .
in 2000 , the world conservation union concluded that the extent of the world 's estimated 11,000 threatened species are critically endangered .
that means we are about to lose them . "
genesis of climate change convention in rio the framework convention on climate change was the highest profile agreement to emerge from the rio summit .
it led to the signing of the kyoto protocol - a legally binding treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below the levels emitted in 1990 .
for kyoto to come into force , 55 countries representing 55 percent of the industrialised countries have to make the treaty part of their domestic law .
only japan and the european union have ratified the kyoto protocol .
and the united states - the largest single air polluter - has rejected the treaty outright saying it is unfair as it excludes developing countries .
" if it is true that man-made emissions are contributing to climate change and that we need to try to remedy that , then the kyoto protocol is not an adequate vehicle to get there , " said margot thorning , the chief economist at the council for capital formation in washington .
" it wo n't really materially reduce the growth of greenhouse gases because the new emitters of greenhouse gases where the greenhouse gases are going up sharply - like india , china , brazil , indonesia and other parts of the world - are not constrained in terms of how fast their greenhouse gas emissions grow . "
humans responsible for climate change ?
in the ten years since rio global emissions of carbon – widely accepted as causing global warming - have increased by 400 million tonnes .
in other words , global emissions have risen by 9 percent rather than decreasing by the roughly 7 percent target set by the kyoto protocol .
and 2002 is becoming the second warmest year ever since accurate records were kept in the 1850s .
david griggs from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said that there is no doubt that the world ’ s climate has changed . "
the global temperature has increased by 0.6 degrees , sea level has risen between 10 and 20 centimetres over the last 100 years , sea ice has retreated , arctic ice has retreated , glaciers have retreated .
the number of indicators that climate has changed are just so many .
what is much more difficult to assess is whether human beings are causing that . "
he said the ipcc after a careful assessment of observations , models and future projections has concluded that it is likely that most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is due to human influence .
depleting forest cover the world ’ s forests also figured at the rio summit and it was decided to create a foundation for an international convention on forests .
an intergovernmental panel on forests was established and adopted over one hundred action proposals .
yet until now no legal framework has been established .
in the meanwhile forest cover has been disappearing at an alarming rate .
between 1985 and 1995 an area as large as mexico was deforested .
in 2000 the un food and agriculture organisation fao cites a global loss of forested area of 2.2 percent .
but according to the world resources institute that estimate could be conservative as it includes plantation forests .
wri 's own estimates which exclude these plantation forests would double the natural forest loss in tropical asia and temperate latin america .
johannesburg : just talk and no action ?
as all eyes turn to the johannesburg summit next week , the united nations is eager to quell critical voices suggesting that johannesburg will be nothing more than a voluble conference resulting in little .
jan pronk , the united nations special envoy to the summit , said " we have too many summits , too many talking shops , and that 's the reason why at this particular conference we have to concentrate on agreements to act .
otherwise such conferences would n't make much sense anymore .
we should n't decide to come back in another five years , because we run from one conference to the other .
we should n't come back until 2015 because that is the time span for action on the basis of the agreements of the last decade . "
the un 's draft plan for implementation which will be discussed at johannesburg is already criticised by environment groups for being too weak .
they argue for johannesburg to succeed there need to be firm targets , financial commitments to meet these goals and enforcement mechanisms to implement them .
germany 's former environment minister and the head of the united nations environment programme , klaus töpfer , agrees .
" ten years before gave us clear and wonderful visionary texts and declarations .
but unluckily it was not integrated enough how to implement this and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not another declaration .

considerable achievements at rio to begin with , the earth summit established the rio declaration , a set of 27 principles defining the rights and responsibilities of the states in regard to the environment .
this was designed to be a global environmental bill of rights .
the rio declaration has been hailed as being progressive by green groups , but has been largely forgotten in favour of agenda 21 .
agenda 21 is a 40 chapter blueprint outlining a plan of action for sustainable development .
it contains over 2,500 recommendations - including detailed proposals on how to reduce wasteful consumption patterns , combat poverty , protect the atmosphere , oceans and bio-diversity and promote sustainable agriculture .
agenda 21 was unique in that it was not restricted to national governments .
6,000 cities and towns adopted the proposals in a practical translation of the " think globally and act locally " idea .
environmentalists fault agenda 21 however , the plan was criticised by environmentalists who said agenda 21 was a vague setof goals lacking clear implementation plans and binding legal requirements .
" positive direction decisions that have resulted from the rio summit have put the world in a slightly better direction than we would be in if these agreements had never been made , " said daniel mittler , an organizer for friends of the earth summit .
" but there have also been a lot of failures .
the picture we see is still dramatic and agenda 21 has clearly not lived up to being a blueprint for a sustainable planet which it was billed to be in 1992 . "
landmark bio- diversity convention born in rio nonetheless , the ideas for two major united nations conventions were born out of rio - the convention on biological diversity and the convention on climate change which led to the kyoto protocol .
the biological diversity convention has been ratified by 183 nations and came into effect in 1993 .
it obliges countries to protect plant and animal species from extinction through habitat preservation and other means .
but its implementation record remains poor .
half the world 's wetlands have been destroyed , most of them in the decade since rio , and 12 percent of bird species alone are threatened with extinction .
" between 1980 and 1995 , for example , the extent of the world 's forests decreased by an area roughly the size of mexico , " said mittler .
" so the fact that we have a global agreement on bio-diversity has n't prevented the loss of bio-diversity globally .
in 2000 , the world conservation union concluded that the extent of the world 's estimated 11,000 threatened species are critically endangered .
that means we are about to lose them . "
genesis of climate change convention in rio the framework convention on climate change was the highest profile agreement to emerge from the rio summit .
it led to the signing of the kyoto protocol - a legally binding treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below the levels emitted in 1990 .
for kyoto to come into force , 55 countries representing 55 percent of the industrialised countries have to make the treaty part of their domestic law .
only japan and the european union have ratified the kyoto protocol .
and the united states - the largest single air polluter - has rejected the treaty outright saying it is unfair as it excludes developing countries .
" if it is true that man-made emissions are contributing to climate change and that we need to try to remedy that , then the kyoto protocol is not an adequate vehicle to get there , " said margot thorning , the chief economist at the council for capital formation in washington .
" it wo n't really materially reduce the growth of greenhouse gases because the new emitters of greenhouse gases where the greenhouse gases are going up sharply - like india , china , brazil , indonesia and other parts of the world - are not constrained in terms of how fast their greenhouse gas emissions grow . "
humans responsible for climate change ?
in the ten years since rio global emissions of carbon – widely accepted as causing global warming - have increased by 400 million tonnes .
in other words , global emissions have risen by 9 percent rather than decreasing by the roughly 7 percent target set by the kyoto protocol .
and 2002 is becoming the second warmest year ever since accurate records were kept in the 1850s .
david griggs from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said that there is no doubt that the world ’ s climate has changed . "
the global temperature has increased by 0.6 degrees , sea level has risen between 10 and 20 centimetres over the last 100 years , sea ice has retreated , arctic ice has retreated , glaciers have retreated .
the number of indicators that climate has changed are just so many .
what is much more difficult to assess is whether human beings are causing that . "
he said the ipcc after a careful assessment of observations , models and future projections has concluded that it is likely that most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is due to human influence .
depleting forest cover the world ’ s forests also figured at the rio summit and it was decided to create a foundation for an international convention on forests .
an intergovernmental panel on forests was established and adopted over one hundred action proposals .
yet until now no legal framework has been established .
in the meanwhile forest cover has been disappearing at an alarming rate .
between 1985 and 1995 an area as large as mexico was deforested .
in 2000 the un food and agriculture organisation fao cites a global loss of forested area of 2.2 percent .
but according to the world resources institute that estimate could be conservative as it includes plantation forests .
wri 's own estimates which exclude these plantation forests would double the natural forest loss in tropical asia and temperate latin america .
johannesburg : just talk and no action ?
as all eyes turn to the johannesburg summit next week , the united nations is eager to quell critical voices suggesting that johannesburg will be nothing more than a voluble conference resulting in little .
jan pronk , the united nations special envoy to the summit , said " we have too many summits , too many talking shops , and that 's the reason why at this particular conference we have to concentrate on agreements to act .
otherwise such conferences would n't make much sense anymore .
we should n't decide to come back in another five years , because we run from one conference to the other .
we should n't come back until 2015 because that is the time span for action on the basis of the agreements of the last decade . "
the un 's draft plan for implementation which will be discussed at johannesburg is already criticised by environment groups for being too weak .
they argue for johannesburg to succeed there need to be firm targets , financial commitments to meet these goals and enforcement mechanisms to implement them .
germany 's former environment minister and the head of the united nations environment programme , klaus töpfer , agrees .
" ten years before gave us clear and wonderful visionary texts and declarations .
but unluckily it was not integrated enough how to implement this and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not another declaration .

" if it is true that man-made emissions are contributing to climate change and that we need to try to remedy that , then the kyoto protocol is not an adequate vehicle to get there , " said margot thorning , the chief economist at the council for capital formation in washington .
" it wo n't really materially reduce the growth of greenhouse gases because the new emitters of greenhouse gases where the greenhouse gases are going up sharply - like india , china , brazil , indonesia and other parts of the world - are not constrained in terms of how fast their greenhouse gas emissions grow . "
humans responsible for climate change ?
in the ten years since rio global emissions of carbon – widely accepted as causing global warming - have increased by 400 million tonnes .
in other words , global emissions have risen by 9 percent rather than decreasing by the roughly 7 percent target set by the kyoto protocol .
and 2002 is becoming the second warmest year ever since accurate records were kept in the 1850s .
david griggs from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said that there is no doubt that the world ’ s climate has changed . "
the global temperature has increased by 0.6 degrees , sea level has risen between 10 and 20 centimetres over the last 100 years , sea ice has retreated , arctic ice has retreated , glaciers have retreated .
the number of indicators that climate has changed are just so many .
what is much more difficult to assess is whether human beings are causing that . "
he said the ipcc after a careful assessment of observations , models and future projections has concluded that it is likely that most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is due to human influence .
depleting forest cover the world ’ s forests also figured at the rio summit and it was decided to create a foundation for an international convention on forests .
an intergovernmental panel on forests was established and adopted over one hundred action proposals .
yet until now no legal framework has been established .
in the meanwhile forest cover has been disappearing at an alarming rate .
between 1985 and 1995 an area as large as mexico was deforested .
in 2000 the un food and agriculture organisation fao cites a global loss of forested area of 2.2 percent .
but according to the world resources institute that estimate could be conservative as it includes plantation forests .
wri 's own estimates which exclude these plantation forests would double the natural forest loss in tropical asia and temperate latin america .
johannesburg : just talk and no action ?
as all eyes turn to the johannesburg summit next week , the united nations is eager to quell critical voices suggesting that johannesburg will be nothing more than a voluble conference resulting in little .
jan pronk , the united nations special envoy to the summit , said " we have too many summits , too many talking shops , and that 's the reason why at this particular conference we have to concentrate on agreements to act .
otherwise such conferences would n't make much sense anymore .
we should n't decide to come back in another five years , because we run from one conference to the other .
we should n't come back until 2015 because that is the time span for action on the basis of the agreements of the last decade . "
the un 's draft plan for implementation which will be discussed at johannesburg is already criticised by environment groups for being too weak .
they argue for johannesburg to succeed there need to be firm targets , financial commitments to meet these goals and enforcement mechanisms to implement them .
germany 's former environment minister and the head of the united nations environment programme , klaus töpfer , agrees .
" ten years before gave us clear and wonderful visionary texts and declarations .
but unluckily it was not integrated enough how to implement this and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not another declaration .

but what has happened to the lofty promises made at rio ?
has the global environment changed for the better in the past ten years ? critical voices even before start of summit despite the sheer scale of the johannesburg summit , some fear this year 's conference wo n't bear as much fruit as its predecessor in rio .
" the earth summit -lrb- in rio -rrb- was a success because it put the environment on the global political map , it made key policy decisions and set up institutions to start to deliver them , " said jamie pittock of the world wildlife fund .
he cites the framework conventions on climate change and biological diversity as examples .
" we would all have liked progress to have been more rapid in the past decade , but the fact that we have those agreements and that those conventions are gradually being implemented is a success , " he said .
considerable achievements at rio to begin with , the earth summit established the rio declaration , a set of 27 principles defining the rights and responsibilities of the states in regard to the environment .
this was designed to be a global environmental bill of rights .
the rio declaration has been hailed as being progressive by green groups , but has been largely forgotten in favour of agenda 21 .
agenda 21 is a 40 chapter blueprint outlining a plan of action for sustainable development .
it contains over 2,500 recommendations - including detailed proposals on how to reduce wasteful consumption patterns , combat poverty , protect the atmosphere , oceans and bio-diversity and promote sustainable agriculture .
agenda 21 was unique in that it was not restricted to national governments .
6,000 cities and towns adopted the proposals in a practical translation of the " think globally and act locally " idea .
environmentalists fault agenda 21 however , the plan was criticised by environmentalists who said agenda 21 was a vague setof goals lacking clear implementation plans and binding legal requirements .
" positive direction decisions that have resulted from the rio summit have put the world in a slightly better direction than we would be in if these agreements had never been made , " said daniel mittler , an organizer for friends of the earth summit .
" but there have also been a lot of failures .
the picture we see is still dramatic and agenda 21 has clearly not lived up to being a blueprint for a sustainable planet which it was billed to be in 1992 . "
landmark bio- diversity convention born in rio nonetheless , the ideas for two major united nations conventions were born out of rio - the convention on biological diversity and the convention on climate change which led to the kyoto protocol .
the biological diversity convention has been ratified by 183 nations and came into effect in 1993 .
it obliges countries to protect plant and animal species from extinction through habitat preservation and other means .
but its implementation record remains poor .
half the world 's wetlands have been destroyed , most of them in the decade since rio , and 12 percent of bird species alone are threatened with extinction .
" between 1980 and 1995 , for example , the extent of the world 's forests decreased by an area roughly the size of mexico , " said mittler .
" so the fact that we have a global agreement on bio-diversity has n't prevented the loss of bio-diversity globally .
in 2000 , the world conservation union concluded that the extent of the world 's estimated 11,000 threatened species are critically endangered .
that means we are about to lose them . "
genesis of climate change convention in rio the framework convention on climate change was the highest profile agreement to emerge from the rio summit .
it led to the signing of the kyoto protocol - a legally binding treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below the levels emitted in 1990 .
for kyoto to come into force , 55 countries representing 55 percent of the industrialised countries have to make the treaty part of their domestic law .
only japan and the european union have ratified the kyoto protocol .
and the united states - the largest single air polluter - has rejected the treaty outright saying it is unfair as it excludes developing countries .
" if it is true that man-made emissions are contributing to climate change and that we need to try to remedy that , then the kyoto protocol is not an adequate vehicle to get there , " said margot thorning , the chief economist at the council for capital formation in washington .

but what has happened to the lofty promises made at rio ?
has the global environment changed for the better in the past ten years ? critical voices even before start of summit despite the sheer scale of the johannesburg summit , some fear this year 's conference wo n't bear as much fruit as its predecessor in rio .
" the earth summit -lrb- in rio -rrb- was a success because it put the environment on the global political map , it made key policy decisions and set up institutions to start to deliver them , " said jamie pittock of the world wildlife fund .
he cites the framework conventions on climate change and biological diversity as examples .
" we would all have liked progress to have been more rapid in the past decade , but the fact that we have those agreements and that those conventions are gradually being implemented is a success , " he said .
considerable achievements at rio to begin with , the earth summit established the rio declaration , a set of 27 principles defining the rights and responsibilities of the states in regard to the environment .
this was designed to be a global environmental bill of rights .
the rio declaration has been hailed as being progressive by green groups , but has been largely forgotten in favour of agenda 21 .
agenda 21 is a 40 chapter blueprint outlining a plan of action for sustainable development .
it contains over 2,500 recommendations - including detailed proposals on how to reduce wasteful consumption patterns , combat poverty , protect the atmosphere , oceans and bio-diversity and promote sustainable agriculture .
agenda 21 was unique in that it was not restricted to national governments .
6,000 cities and towns adopted the proposals in a practical translation of the " think globally and act locally " idea .
environmentalists fault agenda 21 however , the plan was criticised by environmentalists who said agenda 21 was a vague setof goals lacking clear implementation plans and binding legal requirements .
" positive direction decisions that have resulted from the rio summit have put the world in a slightly better direction than we would be in if these agreements had never been made , " said daniel mittler , an organizer for friends of the earth summit .
" but there have also been a lot of failures .
the picture we see is still dramatic and agenda 21 has clearly not lived up to being a blueprint for a sustainable planet which it was billed to be in 1992 . "
landmark bio- diversity convention born in rio nonetheless , the ideas for two major united nations conventions were born out of rio - the convention on biological diversity and the convention on climate change which led to the kyoto protocol .
the biological diversity convention has been ratified by 183 nations and came into effect in 1993 .
it obliges countries to protect plant and animal species from extinction through habitat preservation and other means .
but its implementation record remains poor .
half the world 's wetlands have been destroyed , most of them in the decade since rio , and 12 percent of bird species alone are threatened with extinction .
" between 1980 and 1995 , for example , the extent of the world 's forests decreased by an area roughly the size of mexico , " said mittler .
" so the fact that we have a global agreement on bio-diversity has n't prevented the loss of bio-diversity globally .
in 2000 , the world conservation union concluded that the extent of the world 's estimated 11,000 threatened species are critically endangered .
that means we are about to lose them . "
genesis of climate change convention in rio the framework convention on climate change was the highest profile agreement to emerge from the rio summit .
it led to the signing of the kyoto protocol - a legally binding treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below the levels emitted in 1990 .
for kyoto to come into force , 55 countries representing 55 percent of the industrialised countries have to make the treaty part of their domestic law .
only japan and the european union have ratified the kyoto protocol .
and the united states - the largest single air polluter - has rejected the treaty outright saying it is unfair as it excludes developing countries .
" if it is true that man-made emissions are contributing to climate change and that we need to try to remedy that , then the kyoto protocol is not an adequate vehicle to get there , " said margot thorning , the chief economist at the council for capital formation in washington .
" it wo n't really materially reduce the growth of greenhouse gases because the new emitters of greenhouse gases where the greenhouse gases are going up sharply - like india , china , brazil , indonesia and other parts of the world - are not constrained in terms of how fast their greenhouse gas emissions grow . "
humans responsible for climate change ?
in the ten years since rio global emissions of carbon – widely accepted as causing global warming - have increased by 400 million tonnes .
in other words , global emissions have risen by 9 percent rather than decreasing by the roughly 7 percent target set by the kyoto protocol .
and 2002 is becoming the second warmest year ever since accurate records were kept in the 1850s .
david griggs from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said that there is no doubt that the world ’ s climate has changed . "
the global temperature has increased by 0.6 degrees , sea level has risen between 10 and 20 centimetres over the last 100 years , sea ice has retreated , arctic ice has retreated , glaciers have retreated .
the number of indicators that climate has changed are just so many .
what is much more difficult to assess is whether human beings are causing that . "
he said the ipcc after a careful assessment of observations , models and future projections has concluded that it is likely that most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is due to human influence .
depleting forest cover the world ’ s forests also figured at the rio summit and it was decided to create a foundation for an international convention on forests .
an intergovernmental panel on forests was established and adopted over one hundred action proposals .
yet until now no legal framework has been established .
in the meanwhile forest cover has been disappearing at an alarming rate .
between 1985 and 1995 an area as large as mexico was deforested .
in 2000 the un food and agriculture organisation fao cites a global loss of forested area of 2.2 percent .
but according to the world resources institute that estimate could be conservative as it includes plantation forests .
wri 's own estimates which exclude these plantation forests would double the natural forest loss in tropical asia and temperate latin america .
johannesburg : just talk and no action ?
as all eyes turn to the johannesburg summit next week , the united nations is eager to quell critical voices suggesting that johannesburg will be nothing more than a voluble conference resulting in little .
jan pronk , the united nations special envoy to the summit , said " we have too many summits , too many talking shops , and that 's the reason why at this particular conference we have to concentrate on agreements to act .
otherwise such conferences would n't make much sense anymore .
we should n't decide to come back in another five years , because we run from one conference to the other .
we should n't come back until 2015 because that is the time span for action on the basis of the agreements of the last decade . "

but what has happened to the lofty promises made at rio ?
has the global environment changed for the better in the past ten years ? critical voices even before start of summit despite the sheer scale of the johannesburg summit , some fear this year 's conference wo n't bear as much fruit as its predecessor in rio .
" the earth summit -lrb- in rio -rrb- was a success because it put the environment on the global political map , it made key policy decisions and set up institutions to start to deliver them , " said jamie pittock of the world wildlife fund .
he cites the framework conventions on climate change and biological diversity as examples .
" we would all have liked progress to have been more rapid in the past decade , but the fact that we have those agreements and that those conventions are gradually being implemented is a success , " he said .
considerable achievements at rio to begin with , the earth summit established the rio declaration , a set of 27 principles defining the rights and responsibilities of the states in regard to the environment .
this was designed to be a global environmental bill of rights .
the rio declaration has been hailed as being progressive by green groups , but has been largely forgotten in favour of agenda 21 .
agenda 21 is a 40 chapter blueprint outlining a plan of action for sustainable development .
it contains over 2,500 recommendations - including detailed proposals on how to reduce wasteful consumption patterns , combat poverty , protect the atmosphere , oceans and bio-diversity and promote sustainable agriculture .
agenda 21 was unique in that it was not restricted to national governments .
6,000 cities and towns adopted the proposals in a practical translation of the " think globally and act locally " idea .
environmentalists fault agenda 21 however , the plan was criticised by environmentalists who said agenda 21 was a vague setof goals lacking clear implementation plans and binding legal requirements .
" positive direction decisions that have resulted from the rio summit have put the world in a slightly better direction than we would be in if these agreements had never been made , " said daniel mittler , an organizer for friends of the earth summit .
" but there have also been a lot of failures .
the picture we see is still dramatic and agenda 21 has clearly not lived up to being a blueprint for a sustainable planet which it was billed to be in 1992 . "
landmark bio- diversity convention born in rio nonetheless , the ideas for two major united nations conventions were born out of rio - the convention on biological diversity and the convention on climate change which led to the kyoto protocol .
the biological diversity convention has been ratified by 183 nations and came into effect in 1993 .
it obliges countries to protect plant and animal species from extinction through habitat preservation and other means .
but its implementation record remains poor .
half the world 's wetlands have been destroyed , most of them in the decade since rio , and 12 percent of bird species alone are threatened with extinction .
" between 1980 and 1995 , for example , the extent of the world 's forests decreased by an area roughly the size of mexico , " said mittler .
" so the fact that we have a global agreement on bio-diversity has n't prevented the loss of bio-diversity globally .
in 2000 , the world conservation union concluded that the extent of the world 's estimated 11,000 threatened species are critically endangered .
that means we are about to lose them . "
genesis of climate change convention in rio the framework convention on climate change was the highest profile agreement to emerge from the rio summit .
it led to the signing of the kyoto protocol - a legally binding treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below the levels emitted in 1990 .
for kyoto to come into force , 55 countries representing 55 percent of the industrialised countries have to make the treaty part of their domestic law .
only japan and the european union have ratified the kyoto protocol .
and the united states - the largest single air polluter - has rejected the treaty outright saying it is unfair as it excludes developing countries .
" if it is true that man-made emissions are contributing to climate change and that we need to try to remedy that , then the kyoto protocol is not an adequate vehicle to get there , " said margot thorning , the chief economist at the council for capital formation in washington .
" it wo n't really materially reduce the growth of greenhouse gases because the new emitters of greenhouse gases where the greenhouse gases are going up sharply - like india , china , brazil , indonesia and other parts of the world - are not constrained in terms of how fast their greenhouse gas emissions grow . "
humans responsible for climate change ?
in the ten years since rio global emissions of carbon – widely accepted as causing global warming - have increased by 400 million tonnes .
in other words , global emissions have risen by 9 percent rather than decreasing by the roughly 7 percent target set by the kyoto protocol .
and 2002 is becoming the second warmest year ever since accurate records were kept in the 1850s .
david griggs from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said that there is no doubt that the world ’ s climate has changed . "
the global temperature has increased by 0.6 degrees , sea level has risen between 10 and 20 centimetres over the last 100 years , sea ice has retreated , arctic ice has retreated , glaciers have retreated .
the number of indicators that climate has changed are just so many .
what is much more difficult to assess is whether human beings are causing that . "
he said the ipcc after a careful assessment of observations , models and future projections has concluded that it is likely that most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is due to human influence .
depleting forest cover the world ’ s forests also figured at the rio summit and it was decided to create a foundation for an international convention on forests .
an intergovernmental panel on forests was established and adopted over one hundred action proposals .
yet until now no legal framework has been established .
in the meanwhile forest cover has been disappearing at an alarming rate .
between 1985 and 1995 an area as large as mexico was deforested .
in 2000 the un food and agriculture organisation fao cites a global loss of forested area of 2.2 percent .
but according to the world resources institute that estimate could be conservative as it includes plantation forests .
wri 's own estimates which exclude these plantation forests would double the natural forest loss in tropical asia and temperate latin america .
johannesburg : just talk and no action ?
as all eyes turn to the johannesburg summit next week , the united nations is eager to quell critical voices suggesting that johannesburg will be nothing more than a voluble conference resulting in little .
jan pronk , the united nations special envoy to the summit , said " we have too many summits , too many talking shops , and that 's the reason why at this particular conference we have to concentrate on agreements to act .
otherwise such conferences would n't make much sense anymore .
we should n't decide to come back in another five years , because we run from one conference to the other .
we should n't come back until 2015 because that is the time span for action on the basis of the agreements of the last decade . "
the un 's draft plan for implementation which will be discussed at johannesburg is already criticised by environment groups for being too weak .
they argue for johannesburg to succeed there need to be firm targets , financial commitments to meet these goals and enforcement mechanisms to implement them .
germany 's former environment minister and the head of the united nations environment programme , klaus töpfer , agrees .
" ten years before gave us clear and wonderful visionary texts and declarations .
but unluckily it was not integrated enough how to implement this and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not another declaration .

" positive direction decisions that have resulted from the rio summit have put the world in a slightly better direction than we would be in if these agreements had never been made , " said daniel mittler , an organizer for friends of the earth summit .
" but there have also been a lot of failures .
the picture we see is still dramatic and agenda 21 has clearly not lived up to being a blueprint for a sustainable planet which it was billed to be in 1992 . "
landmark bio- diversity convention born in rio nonetheless , the ideas for two major united nations conventions were born out of rio - the convention on biological diversity and the convention on climate change which led to the kyoto protocol .
the biological diversity convention has been ratified by 183 nations and came into effect in 1993 .
it obliges countries to protect plant and animal species from extinction through habitat preservation and other means .
but its implementation record remains poor .
half the world 's wetlands have been destroyed , most of them in the decade since rio , and 12 percent of bird species alone are threatened with extinction .
" between 1980 and 1995 , for example , the extent of the world 's forests decreased by an area roughly the size of mexico , " said mittler .
" so the fact that we have a global agreement on bio-diversity has n't prevented the loss of bio-diversity globally .
in 2000 , the world conservation union concluded that the extent of the world 's estimated 11,000 threatened species are critically endangered .
that means we are about to lose them . "
genesis of climate change convention in rio the framework convention on climate change was the highest profile agreement to emerge from the rio summit .
it led to the signing of the kyoto protocol - a legally binding treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below the levels emitted in 1990 .
for kyoto to come into force , 55 countries representing 55 percent of the industrialised countries have to make the treaty part of their domestic law .
only japan and the european union have ratified the kyoto protocol .
and the united states - the largest single air polluter - has rejected the treaty outright saying it is unfair as it excludes developing countries .
" if it is true that man-made emissions are contributing to climate change and that we need to try to remedy that , then the kyoto protocol is not an adequate vehicle to get there , " said margot thorning , the chief economist at the council for capital formation in washington .
" it wo n't really materially reduce the growth of greenhouse gases because the new emitters of greenhouse gases where the greenhouse gases are going up sharply - like india , china , brazil , indonesia and other parts of the world - are not constrained in terms of how fast their greenhouse gas emissions grow . "
humans responsible for climate change ?
in the ten years since rio global emissions of carbon – widely accepted as causing global warming - have increased by 400 million tonnes .
in other words , global emissions have risen by 9 percent rather than decreasing by the roughly 7 percent target set by the kyoto protocol .
and 2002 is becoming the second warmest year ever since accurate records were kept in the 1850s .
david griggs from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said that there is no doubt that the world ’ s climate has changed . "
the global temperature has increased by 0.6 degrees , sea level has risen between 10 and 20 centimetres over the last 100 years , sea ice has retreated , arctic ice has retreated , glaciers have retreated .
the number of indicators that climate has changed are just so many .
what is much more difficult to assess is whether human beings are causing that . "
he said the ipcc after a careful assessment of observations , models and future projections has concluded that it is likely that most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is due to human influence .
depleting forest cover the world ’ s forests also figured at the rio summit and it was decided to create a foundation for an international convention on forests .
an intergovernmental panel on forests was established and adopted over one hundred action proposals .
yet until now no legal framework has been established .
in the meanwhile forest cover has been disappearing at an alarming rate .
between 1985 and 1995 an area as large as mexico was deforested .
in 2000 the un food and agriculture organisation fao cites a global loss of forested area of 2.2 percent .
but according to the world resources institute that estimate could be conservative as it includes plantation forests .
wri 's own estimates which exclude these plantation forests would double the natural forest loss in tropical asia and temperate latin america .
johannesburg : just talk and no action ?
as all eyes turn to the johannesburg summit next week , the united nations is eager to quell critical voices suggesting that johannesburg will be nothing more than a voluble conference resulting in little .
jan pronk , the united nations special envoy to the summit , said " we have too many summits , too many talking shops , and that 's the reason why at this particular conference we have to concentrate on agreements to act .
otherwise such conferences would n't make much sense anymore .
we should n't decide to come back in another five years , because we run from one conference to the other .
we should n't come back until 2015 because that is the time span for action on the basis of the agreements of the last decade . "
the un 's draft plan for implementation which will be discussed at johannesburg is already criticised by environment groups for being too weak .
they argue for johannesburg to succeed there need to be firm targets , financial commitments to meet these goals and enforcement mechanisms to implement them .
germany 's former environment minister and the head of the united nations environment programme , klaus töpfer , agrees .
" ten years before gave us clear and wonderful visionary texts and declarations .
but unluckily it was not integrated enough how to implement this and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not another declaration .

the global temperature has increased by 0.6 degrees , sea level has risen between 10 and 20 centimetres over the last 100 years , sea ice has retreated , arctic ice has retreated , glaciers have retreated .
the number of indicators that climate has changed are just so many .
what is much more difficult to assess is whether human beings are causing that . "
he said the ipcc after a careful assessment of observations , models and future projections has concluded that it is likely that most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is due to human influence .
depleting forest cover the world ’ s forests also figured at the rio summit and it was decided to create a foundation for an international convention on forests .
an intergovernmental panel on forests was established and adopted over one hundred action proposals .
yet until now no legal framework has been established .
in the meanwhile forest cover has been disappearing at an alarming rate .
between 1985 and 1995 an area as large as mexico was deforested .
in 2000 the un food and agriculture organisation fao cites a global loss of forested area of 2.2 percent .
but according to the world resources institute that estimate could be conservative as it includes plantation forests .
wri 's own estimates which exclude these plantation forests would double the natural forest loss in tropical asia and temperate latin america .
johannesburg : just talk and no action ?
as all eyes turn to the johannesburg summit next week , the united nations is eager to quell critical voices suggesting that johannesburg will be nothing more than a voluble conference resulting in little .
jan pronk , the united nations special envoy to the summit , said " we have too many summits , too many talking shops , and that 's the reason why at this particular conference we have to concentrate on agreements to act .
otherwise such conferences would n't make much sense anymore .
we should n't decide to come back in another five years , because we run from one conference to the other .
we should n't come back until 2015 because that is the time span for action on the basis of the agreements of the last decade . "
the un 's draft plan for implementation which will be discussed at johannesburg is already criticised by environment groups for being too weak .
they argue for johannesburg to succeed there need to be firm targets , financial commitments to meet these goals and enforcement mechanisms to implement them .
germany 's former environment minister and the head of the united nations environment programme , klaus töpfer , agrees .
" ten years before gave us clear and wonderful visionary texts and declarations .
but unluckily it was not integrated enough how to implement this and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not another declaration .

but what has happened to the lofty promises made at rio ?
has the global environment changed for the better in the past ten years ? critical voices even before start of summit despite the sheer scale of the johannesburg summit , some fear this year 's conference wo n't bear as much fruit as its predecessor in rio .
" the earth summit -lrb- in rio -rrb- was a success because it put the environment on the global political map , it made key policy decisions and set up institutions to start to deliver them , " said jamie pittock of the world wildlife fund .
he cites the framework conventions on climate change and biological diversity as examples .
" we would all have liked progress to have been more rapid in the past decade , but the fact that we have those agreements and that those conventions are gradually being implemented is a success , " he said .
considerable achievements at rio to begin with , the earth summit established the rio declaration , a set of 27 principles defining the rights and responsibilities of the states in regard to the environment .
this was designed to be a global environmental bill of rights .
the rio declaration has been hailed as being progressive by green groups , but has been largely forgotten in favour of agenda 21 .
agenda 21 is a 40 chapter blueprint outlining a plan of action for sustainable development .
it contains over 2,500 recommendations - including detailed proposals on how to reduce wasteful consumption patterns , combat poverty , protect the atmosphere , oceans and bio-diversity and promote sustainable agriculture .
agenda 21 was unique in that it was not restricted to national governments .
6,000 cities and towns adopted the proposals in a practical translation of the " think globally and act locally " idea .
environmentalists fault agenda 21 however , the plan was criticised by environmentalists who said agenda 21 was a vague setof goals lacking clear implementation plans and binding legal requirements .
" positive direction decisions that have resulted from the rio summit have put the world in a slightly better direction than we would be in if these agreements had never been made , " said daniel mittler , an organizer for friends of the earth summit .
" but there have also been a lot of failures .
the picture we see is still dramatic and agenda 21 has clearly not lived up to being a blueprint for a sustainable planet which it was billed to be in 1992 . "
landmark bio- diversity convention born in rio nonetheless , the ideas for two major united nations conventions were born out of rio - the convention on biological diversity and the convention on climate change which led to the kyoto protocol .
the biological diversity convention has been ratified by 183 nations and came into effect in 1993 .
it obliges countries to protect plant and animal species from extinction through habitat preservation and other means .
but its implementation record remains poor .
half the world 's wetlands have been destroyed , most of them in the decade since rio , and 12 percent of bird species alone are threatened with extinction .
" between 1980 and 1995 , for example , the extent of the world 's forests decreased by an area roughly the size of mexico , " said mittler .
" so the fact that we have a global agreement on bio-diversity has n't prevented the loss of bio-diversity globally .
in 2000 , the world conservation union concluded that the extent of the world 's estimated 11,000 threatened species are critically endangered .
that means we are about to lose them . "
genesis of climate change convention in rio the framework convention on climate change was the highest profile agreement to emerge from the rio summit .
it led to the signing of the kyoto protocol - a legally binding treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below the levels emitted in 1990 .
for kyoto to come into force , 55 countries representing 55 percent of the industrialised countries have to make the treaty part of their domestic law .
only japan and the european union have ratified the kyoto protocol .
and the united states - the largest single air polluter - has rejected the treaty outright saying it is unfair as it excludes developing countries .
" if it is true that man-made emissions are contributing to climate change and that we need to try to remedy that , then the kyoto protocol is not an adequate vehicle to get there , " said margot thorning , the chief economist at the council for capital formation in washington .
" it wo n't really materially reduce the growth of greenhouse gases because the new emitters of greenhouse gases where the greenhouse gases are going up sharply - like india , china , brazil , indonesia and other parts of the world - are not constrained in terms of how fast their greenhouse gas emissions grow . "
humans responsible for climate change ?
in the ten years since rio global emissions of carbon – widely accepted as causing global warming - have increased by 400 million tonnes .
in other words , global emissions have risen by 9 percent rather than decreasing by the roughly 7 percent target set by the kyoto protocol .
and 2002 is becoming the second warmest year ever since accurate records were kept in the 1850s .
david griggs from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said that there is no doubt that the world ’ s climate has changed . "

but what has happened to the lofty promises made at rio ?
has the global environment changed for the better in the past ten years ? critical voices even before start of summit despite the sheer scale of the johannesburg summit , some fear this year 's conference wo n't bear as much fruit as its predecessor in rio .
" the earth summit -lrb- in rio -rrb- was a success because it put the environment on the global political map , it made key policy decisions and set up institutions to start to deliver them , " said jamie pittock of the world wildlife fund .
he cites the framework conventions on climate change and biological diversity as examples .
" we would all have liked progress to have been more rapid in the past decade , but the fact that we have those agreements and that those conventions are gradually being implemented is a success , " he said .
considerable achievements at rio to begin with , the earth summit established the rio declaration , a set of 27 principles defining the rights and responsibilities of the states in regard to the environment .
this was designed to be a global environmental bill of rights .
the rio declaration has been hailed as being progressive by green groups , but has been largely forgotten in favour of agenda 21 .
agenda 21 is a 40 chapter blueprint outlining a plan of action for sustainable development .
it contains over 2,500 recommendations - including detailed proposals on how to reduce wasteful consumption patterns , combat poverty , protect the atmosphere , oceans and bio-diversity and promote sustainable agriculture .
agenda 21 was unique in that it was not restricted to national governments .
6,000 cities and towns adopted the proposals in a practical translation of the " think globally and act locally " idea .
environmentalists fault agenda 21 however , the plan was criticised by environmentalists who said agenda 21 was a vague setof goals lacking clear implementation plans and binding legal requirements .
" positive direction decisions that have resulted from the rio summit have put the world in a slightly better direction than we would be in if these agreements had never been made , " said daniel mittler , an organizer for friends of the earth summit .
" but there have also been a lot of failures .
the picture we see is still dramatic and agenda 21 has clearly not lived up to being a blueprint for a sustainable planet which it was billed to be in 1992 . "
landmark bio- diversity convention born in rio nonetheless , the ideas for two major united nations conventions were born out of rio - the convention on biological diversity and the convention on climate change which led to the kyoto protocol .
the biological diversity convention has been ratified by 183 nations and came into effect in 1993 .
it obliges countries to protect plant and animal species from extinction through habitat preservation and other means .
but its implementation record remains poor .
half the world 's wetlands have been destroyed , most of them in the decade since rio , and 12 percent of bird species alone are threatened with extinction .
" between 1980 and 1995 , for example , the extent of the world 's forests decreased by an area roughly the size of mexico , " said mittler .
" so the fact that we have a global agreement on bio-diversity has n't prevented the loss of bio-diversity globally .
in 2000 , the world conservation union concluded that the extent of the world 's estimated 11,000 threatened species are critically endangered .
that means we are about to lose them . "
genesis of climate change convention in rio the framework convention on climate change was the highest profile agreement to emerge from the rio summit .
it led to the signing of the kyoto protocol - a legally binding treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below the levels emitted in 1990 .
for kyoto to come into force , 55 countries representing 55 percent of the industrialised countries have to make the treaty part of their domestic law .
only japan and the european union have ratified the kyoto protocol .
and the united states - the largest single air polluter - has rejected the treaty outright saying it is unfair as it excludes developing countries .
" if it is true that man-made emissions are contributing to climate change and that we need to try to remedy that , then the kyoto protocol is not an adequate vehicle to get there , " said margot thorning , the chief economist at the council for capital formation in washington .
" it wo n't really materially reduce the growth of greenhouse gases because the new emitters of greenhouse gases where the greenhouse gases are going up sharply - like india , china , brazil , indonesia and other parts of the world - are not constrained in terms of how fast their greenhouse gas emissions grow . "
humans responsible for climate change ?
in the ten years since rio global emissions of carbon – widely accepted as causing global warming - have increased by 400 million tonnes .
in other words , global emissions have risen by 9 percent rather than decreasing by the roughly 7 percent target set by the kyoto protocol .
and 2002 is becoming the second warmest year ever since accurate records were kept in the 1850s .
david griggs from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- said that there is no doubt that the world ’ s climate has changed . "
the global temperature has increased by 0.6 degrees , sea level has risen between 10 and 20 centimetres over the last 100 years , sea ice has retreated , arctic ice has retreated , glaciers have retreated .
the number of indicators that climate has changed are just so many .
what is much more difficult to assess is whether human beings are causing that . "
he said the ipcc after a careful assessment of observations , models and future projections has concluded that it is likely that most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is due to human influence .
depleting forest cover the world ’ s forests also figured at the rio summit and it was decided to create a foundation for an international convention on forests .
an intergovernmental panel on forests was established and adopted over one hundred action proposals .
yet until now no legal framework has been established .
in the meanwhile forest cover has been disappearing at an alarming rate .
between 1985 and 1995 an area as large as mexico was deforested .
in 2000 the un food and agriculture organisation fao cites a global loss of forested area of 2.2 percent .
but according to the world resources institute that estimate could be conservative as it includes plantation forests .
wri 's own estimates which exclude these plantation forests would double the natural forest loss in tropical asia and temperate latin america .
johannesburg : just talk and no action ?
as all eyes turn to the johannesburg summit next week , the united nations is eager to quell critical voices suggesting that johannesburg will be nothing more than a voluble conference resulting in little .
jan pronk , the united nations special envoy to the summit , said " we have too many summits , too many talking shops , and that 's the reason why at this particular conference we have to concentrate on agreements to act .
otherwise such conferences would n't make much sense anymore .
we should n't decide to come back in another five years , because we run from one conference to the other .
we should n't come back until 2015 because that is the time span for action on the basis of the agreements of the last decade . "
the un 's draft plan for implementation which will be discussed at johannesburg is already criticised by environment groups for being too weak .
they argue for johannesburg to succeed there need to be firm targets , financial commitments to meet these goals and enforcement mechanisms to implement them .
germany 's former environment minister and the head of the united nations environment programme , klaus töpfer , agrees .
" ten years before gave us clear and wonderful visionary texts and declarations .
but unluckily it was not integrated enough how to implement this and therefore johannesburg must be the summit of implementation and not another declaration .

nortel has already reduced its staff dramatically , and now aims to have just 35,000 employees at the end of 2002 compared with 95,500 two years earlier .
the news of yet more job cuts came as the firm lowered its sales targets and announced a cost restructuring .
nortel , which supplies telecoms and internet equipment , blamed a lack of spending by telecoms firms for its ongoing woes .
investor agony many phone firms are themselves suffering crippling debt as a result of the hi-tech slump , and can no longer afford to invest in new networks .
nortel now expects its revenues during the july-september quarter to be 10 % lower than its previous forecast .
but it claims it can still return to profitability by the end of june 2003 .
nortel shares closed 4.7 % lower at $ 1.23 on tuesday , a fraction of the $ 85 price reached in july 2000 .

the discussions , being held in the south korean capital seoul , are a follow-up to a ministerial meeting between the two sides earlier this month .
north and south korea must open a wide road for prosperity and unification by driving a train of co-operation through a barrier of division pak chang-ryon north korea 's chief delegate the talks are expected to focus largely on practical issues such as how safely to cross the demilitarised zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- dividing the two states - one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world .
the meeting is the latest step in a diplomatic charm offensive by the stalinist north , which has recent turned to the outside world , primarily the united states and south korea , for much needed help .
easing shortages north korea 's chief delegate , pak chang-ryon , said the re-opening of crucial transport routes was essential to ease food and energy shortages .
" north and south korea must open a wide road for prosperity and unification by driving a train of co-operation through a barrier of division , " he told french news agency afp .
the stalinist north have been reaching out to their neighbours correspondents say there may be discussion of the final destination of the cross-border rail link .
south korea favours a route which would lead into china , while officials from the north appear to favour connecting directly into the russian far east .
russian president vladimir putin pressed north korea last week to build a new train line across the korean peninsula , bypassing china , by extending russia 's trans-siberian railway .
the new asia-europe freight link would be expected to help revitalise russia 's far east .
commitment needed the ministerial meetings two weeks ago failed to reach a consensus over building a railway through the dmz that bisects the korean peninsula .
this time , talks are expected to focus on bringing military units together to complete the railroad safely , avoiding the many mines and razor wire strewn across the length of the dmz , south korean officials say .
south korea has also said it will send rice to its impoverished neighbour , but the government has stressed that in turn it expects north korea to be co-operative .
analysts say that the rice aid could be used as leverage to persuade the north to make a firm commitment regarding the railway .
" unless the talks produce any tangible progress on railway and road connections , the south would not provide rice to the north , " said korea development institute analyst shin ji-ho .
" most of all , north korea wants rice shipments from south korea at a time when it is trying to reform its economic system . "
trade improvements relinking the railway would not only ease tension between the two countries , analysts say , but would also aid industrialisation and improve international trade in the north .
under the 2000 agreement between north and south , the rail line will eventually connect seoul with the north korean capital pyongyang .
south korea has nearly finished its side , but the north has done little .
the two koreas remain technically at war as they never signed a peace treaty when hostilities ended in 1953 .

the pledge from rail union aslef came as up to 100,000 train passengers faced chaos during a second walk out by drivers over pay .
aslef went ahead with the strike on tuesday and wednesday , leading to the cancellation of most first north western services .
it accused the company of attaching " unacceptable proposals " to a 19 % pay-rise offer .
arbitration failed the union claims first north western wants drivers to take on responsibilities such as picking up litter at stations .
however , the operator insists the union reneged on an agreement previously reached to give drivers the pay increase over three years .
the action , which was set to continue on wednesday , came after the first walkout on 13 and 14 august .
the next strike is planned for 10 and 11 september .
negotiations organised by the conciliation service acas broke down last week .
planned strike however , an aslef spokesman said the union was willing to reconvene talks .
he said : " we are willing to get back around the table but no meeting has been scheduled .
" it is almost inevitable wednesday 's action will go ahead but the outcome of any talks could of course have an effect on the planned 48-hour strike next month . "
the affected region includes stretches from carlisle to buxton and also includes north wales .
first north western was unable to comment but managing director vernon barker has previously said : " i remain available at all times to talk to aslef " .

"
today , the first words a dealer is likely to hear from a customer is what kind of discount can i expect from you ? "
steve evans , chief executive of carpricecheck according to a survey of 3,500 car buyers , two-thirds think manufacturers are being " greedy " .
only 2 % believe the disparity between prices in europe and prices in the uk is due to different tax rates .
two years ago , manufacturers were ordered to reduce their prices by about 10 % across the board .
car makers complied and reduced their prices .
but , further comparable cuts have been few and far between on average .
better deal ?
carpricecheck 's latest data shows that new car transaction prices in the uk have fallen by only a third of one percent in the opening six months of 2002 .
this is the equivalent of a £ 36 saving on a £ 12,000 family hatchback .
according to the survey , 61 % felt they were getting a better deal this time around than when they bought last time , but most felt that the cost was still too dear .
as many as 84 % fell that car prices were still too high .
a further 14 % considered dealers were keeping prices artificially high .
haggle over prices experts said , however , that consumers were more likely to get a better deal .
steve evans , chief executive of carpricecheck , said : " we 've seen a culture shift since the hey-days of the rip off britain campaign back in 1999 .
today , the first words a dealer is likely to hear from a customer is " what kind of discount can i expect from you ? something that was alien to the majority of car buyers two to three years ago . "
he added : " the question of whether prices have or have n't fallen may still confuse the consumer , but they 've certainly embraced the concept of not buying from the first dealer they visit . "
european change from october onwards , new europe-wide rules governing the sale of cars come into effect .
car makers then have a year 's grace to comply with new requirements aimed at improving consumer choice and reducing prices .
dealers will be allowed to sell cars of more than one make in the same showroom .
so a single shopping trip to one dealership could replace three separate visits to showrooms .

in an open letter to the bbc on the website , save the soap said that the patience of the soap 's " loyal viewers " was being tested .
" eastenders is great viewing , the number one show in the uk .
with some effort it can be a success over here , but it needs promotion . "
" promote eastenders , make it something that your channel is proud of rather than embarrassed and has tucked away in an impossible timeslot . "
the website currently claims that it is has been temporarily suspended " due to aggressive legal tactics from the bbc and its lawyers " .
the petition has now been moved to www.diverdown.org.

the appeal court is going ahead with the trial of chhouk rin , despite his refusal to attend the hearing , which he argues is politically motivated .
the court ordered chhouk rin to appear in court on 4 september , when a verdict is due to be handed down .
chhouk rin had been convicted two years ago of the murders , but he was set free shortly afterwards when another court ruled he was covered by an amnesty for guerrillas who laid down their arms .
correspondents say pressure from the tourists ' families and governments has forced the cambodian authorities to hear the case , seen by many as a litmus test for the government 's commitment to try former khmer rouge leaders , again .
victim 's father in court chhouk rin 's lawyer said on tuesday that the court had refused to allow the defence sufficient time to summon witnesses , so the defendant was refusing to attend as he felt he would not get a fair hearing .
australian david wilson , one of those killed the british and australian ambassadors were both in court , alongside the father of the french victim of the 1994 attack and his lawyer .
australian david wilson , frenchman jean-michel braquet and briton mark slater were kidnapped in an ambush of a train by former khmer rouge rebels .
at least 10 cambodians were killed during the attack .
the three foreigners and several cambodians were taken to the nearby vine mountain rebel base in the southern cambodian province of kampot .
they were killed after negotiations for their release and the payment of a $ 150,000 ransom broke down .
international concern the khmer rouge commander of vine mountain , nuon paet , was jailed for life in june 1999 for his role in the affair .
his superior officer and the man he said had ordered the tourists killed , sam bith , was arrested in may and is in jail awaiting trial .
but there is continuing international concern that cambodia 's government is not serious about its commitment to bring former khmer rouge leaders to trial .
negotiations between the un and the cambodian government to set up an international tribunal broke down in february , after un officials said they were concerned the planned hearings would not meet international standards of justice .
but last week cambodia 's prime minister hun sen agreed to work with the un to revive talks on the issue .

the sale of the assets - which include key pipelines - would leave almost nothing behind and would be tantamount to liquidation , sources familiar with the firm said .
stephen cooper once wanted to relaunch enron enron has been restructuring itself whilst in administration and was previously expected to emerge as a new firm focused on the core power and pipeline businesses .
the u-turn on restructuring reflects growing pressure from creditors to be paid their due .
thousands of employees lost their savings and pensions when the firm went bust last december , while banks have also been left out of pocket .
more job losses ?
the firm 's new chief executive , stephen cooper , has stressed that his key goal is to squeeze as much money as possible out of the firm for its creditors .
but he had previously argued that the assets would be worth more if the firm was recreated as a going concern rather than sold off piecemeal .
in may , mr cooper presented plans to a bankruptcy court , claiming that a new enron - employing 12,000 staff - could achieve pre-tax profits of $ 1.3bn in 2003 .
although creditors may be cheered by a sell-off , it is bad news for remaining employees .
final bids for the assets are expected in november , and the firm has said it will not sell if the price is too low .
back to basics enron built its original gas and power pipeline business into an energy trading giant that became the us ' seventh largest firm .
but its rapid expansion - and escalating profits - turned out to be based on false accounting methods that artificially inflated its size and potential .
its collapse - the largest corporate bankruptcy in the us at the time - was the first and arguably the most shocking of the recent wave of corporate scandals .
federal prosecutors are working to try and charge senior executives at the firm with securities fraud and insider trading . watch / listen on this story luc despins , lead lawyer - creditors ' committee " there are more than 100,000 creditors in the case " the bbc 's vicki broadbent " although creditors may be cheered by a sell-off , it is bad news for remaining employees " full story in-depth latest news fastow surrenders building the case sharing out the cash first guilty plea background scandal at-a-glance liquidation looms ?
