the government is preparing new legislation after considering a report from the gaming review body , which recommended deregulation .
among the report 's recommendations were allowing clubs to mix " hard " gaming - like casino games - with " soft " gaming , like bingo .
but bingo club owners fear a shake-up could threaten their future and are further warning that bingo would be used to tempt punters into " problem gambling " .
the gaming review body , chaired by the former treasury economist sir alan budd , also proposed all-night betting with alcohol and live entertainment .
it also advocated ending restrictions which force people to apply for membership of bingo halls and casinos 24 hours before they can play .
but sir peter fry , the chairman of the bingo association , said : " bingo will simply become a loss-leading product , used by casinos to tempt bingo players into playing harder forms of gambling .
closures " overall revenues to the government might increase marginally as a result of shifting spending between gaming activities but at the cost of significantly higher levels of problem gambling and the loss of bingo . "
" budd 's recommendations represent a sea-change in gaming policy and could be extremely damaging to the licensed bingo sector " sir peter fry bingo association sir peter said he was not opposed to casinos , but warned that bingo clubs formed part of the social fabric of communities .
they were already under pressure from high taxes and competition from the national lottery and scratchcards , he said .
he disputed the report 's conclusion that bingo club numbers would not be affected .
" in practice , it is far more likely that existing bingo club premises will convert to casinos with a large number of stand-alone clubs closing as a result . "
sir peter also warned that bingo players may be alienated by the harder gaming atmosphere .
and repercussions for bingo clubs could affect the exchequer .
the department of culture , media and sport said it could not comment on the claims before the white paper was published .

the conference is trying to arrange the financing which will pay for the millennium development goals agreed by the un two years ago .
rock star bono has been pushing bush on world debt relief but the us has always been regarded as the bad boy of development aid .
consider for a minute the figures .
the united states gives some $ 11bn a year in aid to the world 's poorest nations .
it may sound like a lot , but not when you consider it 's only about 0.1 % of america 's gdp .
it also compares badly with the world 's other rich nations which tend to give around 0.3 % of their economic output in aid .
new policy indeed , the us in general and the bush administration in particular has always sounded decidely sceptical about the whole concept of rich nations giving to poor .
us treasury secretary paul o 'neill noted recently that the world had " precious little " to show from four decades of aid .
the us is willing to give aid , if countries measure up that 's why president george w bush was expected to be something of a target in monterrey for those who believe the us does not do enough to help the world 's poor .
i say " was " because president bush has now announced a major shift in us aid policy in something of a pre-emptive strike at potential monterrey critics . < speaking in washington just days before leaving for mexico the president not only reaffirmed the usefulness of foreign aid , but promised an extra $ 5bn of it , a 15 % increase on exisiting totals .
but it wo n't be given to just anyone .
three tests in an effort to end what might be called the wide perception of aid money ending up lining the pockets of third world dictators , the president laid down some conditions .
he said it would only go to countries that live by three broad standards - " ruling justly , investing in their people , and encouraging economic freedom " .
and this in essence is the message president bush and his army of officials and diplomats will be taking to monterrey .
methods not figures the message is that the us is prepared to give more money but that there has to be good government in return from the developing world .
that general principle is already enshrined to some extent in the pre-agreed un document government leaders will rubber-stamp in moneterrey , which urges the rich nations to give more and the poor nations to do better with the money they get .
so will monterrey be all about how much money ?
not if the us can help it .
american officials say the debate needs to be less about how much aid is given and more about how to use it .
will the rich do more ?
