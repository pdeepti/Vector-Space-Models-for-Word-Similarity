today the socialist relic is being lovingly restored to its former glory . berlin might be known as a modern , hip and pulsating metropolis .
but visit the alexanderplatz in the east and you 'll wonder if the wall really did come down in 1989 .
time seems to have stood still at this windswept square .
dreary prefabricated buildings and a general dilapidated air evoke images of berlin 's socialist past .
but nothing captures the spirit of socialism more than the towering coloured mosaic on the eastern side of the square .
wrapped around the haus des lehrers -lrb- house of the teacher -rrb- , the former east german education ministry , thousands of ceramic slabs show people at work - doctors , construction workers , teachers , painters , architects - ordinary people living ordinary lives and being productive beings in society .
the outlines are bold , simple and geometric .
no fancy fluff , just good old down-to-earth socialist-realistic art .
this is our life small wonder that the artist , 76-year-old walter womacka called his 125-metre-long and 7-metre-high frieze , " our life " .
the frieze is meant to depict the development of the former german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- - idealistically .
walter womacka does n't see anything wrong with that .
in an interview with the berliner zeitung he said , " there is so much of anonymity in today 's art .
i always wanted to take a stand " .
but like most of the surrounding buildings , womacka 's mural of the socialist ideal too has fallen into disrepair : the child in the arms of his mother looks faded , an apple tree in the background is worn out , a woman 's breast is almost completely missing as several of the ceramic blocks have dropped off over the years .
the mural will soon disappear behind a huge scaffolding as both the haus des lehrers and the neighbouring domed congress centre - registered national landmarks protected by a special act , will be restored . womacka 's mosaic made of thousands of brightly coloured glass pieces will be carefully picked out , repaired by a team of restoration experts and replaced by october 2003 .
the project will cost some 500,000 euro .
till then capitalism will reign here instead of socialism : the firm wall will rent out the empty space where the mural once stood .
a sprinter will advertise here for sports shoes .
socialist art : ups and downs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when communists dream , a womacka work from 1975 womacka designed the mural in 1962/63 .
commissioned by the cultural ministry of the gdr to create " something relevant that shows our life " , he was thereafter flooded with orders to create murals for the glass windows of the city council hall , the paintings in the former foreign ministry , the international friendship fountain in the middle of the alexanderplatz and the gigantic copper frieze on the haus des reisens .
after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , several buildings in the eastern part of the city were simply pulled down or razed , along with it much of womacka 's handiwork .
after all many people did n't want to be reminded of the city 's socialist past in the form of propaganda art .
pictures and images of the flag waving proletariat , soldiers reaching out to help working women with headscarves , contented farmers , engineers and sportsmen have been wiped out from squares and streets since .
back in fashion but today , more than a decade after the end of socialism , it 's suddenly become trendy to throw parties in a nostalgically socialist atmosphere .
several of berlin 's eastern former communist districts such as mitte and prenzlauer berg are " happening " places that attract young creative talent .
even womacka 's massive window mosaic in the city council hall with the cheerful tractor drivers still exists .
several foreign tourists crowd to see and photograph it .
though the artist finds this development " scurrilous " , at least his art remains intact , he told the berliner zeitung .
womacka will also assist the experts in restoring his socialist mural at the haus des lehrers .
" it feels a bit strange to have to do with the frieze again after so long .
it 's a bit like slipping into the early days of the gdr , " he told the newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic picture of the day dw-tv europe live journal - die woche we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

regional analyst nicholas nugent assesses its likely priorities .
a small nation that can not afford a big army will try to guarantee its security through diplomacy . "
gusmao ... seems to be emulating ...
nelson mandela , in the absence of any vindictiveness towards his former enemy " this truism has already been adopted as a principle of east timor 's foreign policy , which is why the new nation 's highest priorities are to establish friendly relations with indonesia and australia , its two big neighbours .
independence marks the formalisation of east timor 's breach from indonesia after quarter of a century of brutal rule , so it will take magnanimity to sink past differences and build a new friendship .
yet this is what the new government in dili , the east timor capital , has set out to do .
moving on east timor shares an island and a land border with its large western neighbour and most of its people were brought up to speak the indonesian language .
some went for higher education in java , bali or elsewhere .
an estimated 60,000 still live in refugee camps in indonesia , though the new government hopes to persuade them to return .
east timor 's new president , xanana gusmao , the former guerrilla fighter who spent six years in indonesian prisons , seems to be emulating another guerrilla leader-turned president , nelson mandela , in the absence of any vindictiveness towards his former enemy .
he knows that , as neighbours , they have to get on .
there are differences though .
apart from the refugees in west timor , gusmao and his government are disappointed that jakarta has so far brought to trial only a handful of the army officers implicated in the violence and destruction that followed east timor 's vote to break with indonesia .
australia 's legacy relations are warmer with australia , which was the first country to send in peacekeepers to put down that violence .
since then , australian soldiers and civilians have played an important role in rebuilding east timor , and australian cities have been key stopping points for east timorese ministers seeking foreign help and support .
yet dili is eager to renegotiate sea boundaries with its southern neighbour , to assert its rights over the oil and gas fields in the so-called timor gap .
after normalisation of relations with indonesia , this is the next most delicate area of diplomacy ahead because it will determine how much revenue the new government collects .
after establishing embassies in jakarta and canberra , east timor 's foreign minister , jose ramos horta , plans to send diplomats to portugal , the territory 's colonial ruler , whose language has been adopted as the national tongue .
east timor will also open missions in brussels and washington , reflecting the closeness it has established with countries of the european union and with america during the transition period .
dili may also have calculated that these nations are best placed to offer continuing financial assistance as the new nation strives to become self-sufficient .
opening overseas missions will strain the resources of a small nation of around 800,000 inhabitants .
joining the clubs beyond bilateral relationships , dili is keen to join the right international ' clubs ' .
top of the list is undoubtedly the united nations , to which it expects to gain speedy admission .
it also wants to join asean , a security and economic alliance of south east asian nations .
membership of asean would help it to heal differences with indonesia and give access to other key neighbours like thailand , the philippines and singapore , all of whom contributed troops to the peacekeeping force in timor .
reaching out east timor will open six foreign embassies this year they will be in jakarta , canberra , lisbon , kuala lumpur , washington and brussels wants to join asean , the un and maybe the south pacific forum deputy foreign minister fernando de araujo told an australian audience that east timor wanted to be part of asean , and was equally keen to strengthen what he called ' south-south relations ' with other third world countries in the asian region .
he said : " we face the same dilemmas as them in development and nation building . "
one possible problem is that burma is threatening to block east timor 's membership because xanana gusmao has criticised the regime there .
interestingly , the main push for east timor to be admitted is coming from within asean , suggesting the invitation will not be long in coming .
east timorese leaders have already been invited to asean meetings as observers .
dili may also seek membership of the south pacific forum , which links australia and new zealand with papua new guinea and other pacific island states .
it could become the first nation to belong to both asean and the forum .
a novel suggestion from indonesia is that a new west pacific forum be created to link australia , east timor and indonesia - and perhaps papua new guinea .
east timor 's new leaders are acutely conscious that they were the cause of indonesia and australia falling out , when canberra reversed its support for the territory 's incorporation as an indonesian province .
they would like to have just as powerful role in bringing their two strong neighbours together again .

regional analyst nicholas nugent assesses its likely priorities .
a small nation that can not afford a big army will try to guarantee its security through diplomacy .
gusmao ... seems to be emulating ...
nelson mandela , in the absence of any vindictiveness towards his former enemy this truism has already been adopted as a principle of east timor 's foreign policy , which is why the new nation 's highest priorities are to establish friendly relations with indonesia and australia , its two big neighbours .
independence marks the formalisation of east timor 's breach from indonesia after quarter of a century of brutal rule , so it will take magnanimity to sink past differences and build a new friendship .
yet this is what the new government in dili , the east timor capital , has set out to do .
moving on east timor shares an island and a land border with its large western neighbour and most of its people were brought up to speak the indonesian language .
some went for higher education in java , bali or elsewhere .
after indonesia 's brutal rule , east timor wants to mend ties an estimated 60,000 still live in refugee camps in indonesia , though the new government hopes to persuade them to return .
east timor 's new president , xanana gusmao , the former guerrilla fighter who spent six years in indonesian prisons , seems to be emulating another guerrilla leader-turned president , nelson mandela , in the absence of any vindictiveness towards his former enemy .
he knows that , as neighbours , they have to get on .
there are differences though .
apart from the refugees in west timor , gusmao and his government are disappointed that jakarta has so far brought to trial only a handful of the army officers implicated in the violence and destruction that followed east timor 's vote to break with indonesia .
australia 's legacy relations are warmer with australia , which was the first country to send in peacekeepers to put down that violence .
east timor has a special relationship with australia since then , australian soldiers and civilians have played an important role in rebuilding east timor , and australian cities have been key stopping points for east timorese ministers seeking foreign help and support .
yet dili is eager to renegotiate sea boundaries with its southern neighbour , to assert its rights over the oil and gas fields in the so-called timor gap .
after normalisation of relations with indonesia , this is the next most delicate area of diplomacy ahead because it will determine how much revenue the new government collects .
after establishing embassies in jakarta and canberra , east timor 's foreign minister , jose ramos horta , plans to send diplomats to portugal , the territory 's colonial ruler , whose language has been adopted as the national tongue .
east timor will also open missions in brussels and washington , reflecting the closeness it has established with countries of the european union and with america during the transition period .
dili may also have calculated that these nations are best placed to offer continuing financial assistance as the new nation strives to become self-sufficient .
opening overseas missions will strain the resources of a small nation of around 800,000 inhabitants .
joining the clubs beyond bilateral relationships , dili is keen to join the right international ' clubs ' .
top of the list is undoubtedly the united nations , to which it expects to gain speedy admission .
it also wants to join asean , a security and economic alliance of south east asian nations .
membership of asean would help it to heal differences with indonesia and give access to other key neighbours like thailand , the philippines and singapore , all of whom contributed troops to the peacekeeping force in timor .
reaching out east timor will open six foreign embassies this year they will be in jakarta , canberra , lisbon , kuala lumpur , washington and brussels wants to join asean , the un and maybe the south pacific forum deputy foreign minister fernando de araujo told an australian audience that east timor wanted to be part of asean , and was equally keen to strengthen what he called ' south-south relations ' with other third world countries in the asian region .
he said : " we face the same dilemmas as them in development and nation building . "
one possible problem is that burma is threatening to block east timor 's membership because xanana gusmao has criticised the regime there .
interestingly , the main push for east timor to be admitted is coming from within asean , suggesting the invitation will not be long in coming .
east timorese leaders have already been invited to asean meetings as observers .
dili may also seek membership of the south pacific forum , which links australia and new zealand with papua new guinea and other pacific island states .
it could become the first nation to belong to both asean and the forum .
a novel suggestion from indonesia is that a new west pacific forum be created to link australia , east timor and indonesia - and perhaps papua new guinea .
east timor 's new leaders are acutely conscious that they were the cause of indonesia and australia falling out , when canberra reversed its support for the territory 's incorporation as an indonesian province .
they would like to have just as powerful role in bringing their two strong neighbours together again .

" no pain , no growth .
no pain , no gain , " mr koizumi told the financial times newspaper .
the only thing that has changed is the approval rating for my administration junichiro koizumi mr koizumi dismissed claims he was being forced to slow his reform agenda and vowed to press ahead with plans to speed up the disposal of bad loans and reduce the power of the state sector .
" one thing i will stick to is steadily carrying through the structural reform policy that i 've maintained , " he said .
" the policy i 've been advocating since i took office on day one has not changed .
the only thing that has changed is the approval rating for my administration . "
tide turning just one year after being swept to office on a wave of public euphoria , mr koizumi 's political fortunes are at a low ebb .
his approval rating has fallen below 50 % , and few now see him as the man to rescue japan from economic stagnation .
a key part of mr koizumi 's election promise was to revive an economy that has been entrenched in a deep recession .
but his plans for privatisation have been highly contentious and caused a rift within his own liberal democratic party .
privatisation goals despite the opposition , mr koizumi refused to admit that the reform plans are being watered down .
" the biggest objective that my cabinet has set itself is to leave to the private sector what the private sector can do , " he said .
mr koizumi also set himself a two year deadline to implement his promised reforms .
over the next 12 months , he prioritised three goals : to accelerate the disposal of non-performing loans ; dissolve the state housing loan corporation ; and pass legislation for privatising the post office .
