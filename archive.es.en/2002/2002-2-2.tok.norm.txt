labour must be prepared to take advantage of new legislation that will allow political parties to discriminate in favour of women when choosing parliamentary candidates , according to the party 's general secretary david triesman .
my personal ambition is to see equal representation for women at all levels of public office david triesman party general secretary the legislation , due to come into force within weeks , is a stepping stone towards labour 's commitment to have just under half of its mps women .
but the liberal democrats and conservatives have already rejected the idea of women-only shortlists .
shortfall women currently account for only 25 % of labour mps - short of the 35 % the party aims to have in place by the next election .
labour 's governing national executive committee is due to discuss shortly how to achieve the party 's objective of improving the proportion of women and ethnic minority candidates .
on the opening day of labour 's local government and women 's conference , mr triesman told a reception : " my personal ambition is to see equal representation for women at all levels of public office .
" i believe the party should adopt measures that ensure the selection of more women candidates and if that means all-women shortlists , then that 's what we should do . "
labour is under pressure to introduce all-women shortlists , especially in areas like wales , scotland and the north east of england where there are fewer women mps .
cabinet enforcer minister barbara roache wants to get a voluntary agreement with constituencies but has warned that if necessary action would be imposed .
the conservatives and liberal democrats are also being urged to make sure more women get elected despite their rejecting calls for all-women shortlists .
a previous labour attempt to use all-women shortlists was ruled illegal by an industrial tribunal .
but the government 's sex discrimination -lrb- election candidates -rrb- bill passed through its final parliamentary stages this week . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's robin crystal " nearly a quarter of labour mps are women " the bbc 's nick jones " labour have made the most progress " see also : 01 feb 02 -pipe- uk politics labour 's task in cardiff 01 feb 02 -pipe- uk politics do n't blame it all on us - blunkett 21 dec 01 -pipe- uk politics all-women shortlists clear new hurdle 06 may 01 -pipe- uk politics labour to change women shortlist law 17 oct 01 -pipe- uk politics labour tackles women trouble 03 aug 01 -pipe- uk politics duncan smith rejects women-only lists 27 sep 01 -pipe- uk politics lib dems reject women-only lists internet links : conservative party labour party liberal democrats the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top uk politics stories now : straw defends arms sales change judge urges life sentence shake-up care home red-tape ' wrecking lives ' eu must expand , straw warns hain turns fire on greens blair 's right-hand men under the spotlight schools ' budgets may be frozen margaret cook blasts ' nhs meddling ' links to more uk politics stories are at the foot of the page .

this is , in fact , little short of declaring a war against the democratic people 's republic of korea north korea foreign ministry former us secretary of state madeleine albright called mr bush 's comments " a big mistake " .
" first of all they -lrb- iran , iraq and north korea -rrb- are very different from each other , " she said .

nato 's secretary-general lord robertson has warned the us it will have to provide evidence to justify any action against iran , iraq and north korea .
nato gave the us its full support following the 11 september attacks , invoking article five of its founding treaty for the first time , which says an attack on one member is an attack on all .
but bbc world affairs correspondent paul reynolds says that lord robertson 's comments at the world economic forum in new york reflect nato unease at expanding the war on terror .
president bush maintained his tough stance on friday , saying " all the three countries i mentioned are now on notice that we intend to take their development of weapons of mass destruction very seriously " .
but he did hold out the prospect of talks with north korea , saying the us would be " more than happy to enter into a dialogue " if the country made a clear statement of its peaceful intentions .

he was abducted in karachi a week ago by a group demanding better conditions for al-qaeda suspects in american custody .
the kidnappers also called for the return of any pakistani nationals among them to face trial in pakistan , and the release of the former taleban ambassador to pakistan , abdul salam zaeef .
pakistani politician and former international cricketer imran khan has urged mr pearl 's kidnappers to release him .
mr khan said he opposed the indiscriminate use of force and the mistreatment of prisoners-of-war .
but he said mr pearl 's abduction was " unlikely to help the innocent victims of the afghan conflict . "
us president george w bush expressed serious concern on friday about the journalist 's fate after several news organisations received an e-mail saying mr pearl had been killed .
ransom report another unconfirmed report said mr pearl 's kidnappers were demanding a ransom of $ 2m for his release .
a deadline apparently set by mr pearl 's kidnappers for their demands to be met expired on friday .
mr bush said every effort was being made to find mr pearl .
" we 're working with the pakistani government to chase down any leads possible - for example we 're trying to follow the trail of the e-mails that have been sent , with the sole purpose of saving this man , of finding him and rescuing him , " he said .
bbc islamabad correspondent susannah price says there is still no sign of any concrete progress in pakistan 's attempts to trace the journalist .
after mr pearl 's abduction , a group calling itself the national movement for the restoration of pakistani sovereignty sent two e-mails to the wall street journal accusing him of being a spy - which the newspaper strongly denied .
