elections could be as soon as november , a year early . austrian chancellor wolfgang schuessel announced on monday that his conservative people ’ s party would end its coalition with joerg haider ’ s far-right freedom party , and called for new elections as soon as possible .
the move followed weekend resignations by vice chancellor susanne riess-passer and finance minister karl-heinz grasser , both members of the far-right freedom party .
riess-passer also resigned as party chairwoman .
on monday , fellow party member and transportation minister mathias reichhold also stepped down . the actions were part of an ongoing dispute with haider over the implementation of planned tax cuts .
the freedom party ’ s top government ministers had sided with chancellor schuessel , who said that the tax cuts needed to be delayed so the country could cope with damage from the severe flooding that swept through austria and much of central europe in august .
in austria , 8 people died in the disaster , and damage is estimated at 6.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- . haider resigned under worldwide criticism in 2000 political analysts said the resignations of riess-passer and her colleagues signal haider ’ s return to the center of austrian politics .
haider holds no official leadership position in his party or in the ruling coalition , having given up his party chairmanship in march 2000 amid intense international criticism of his ultra-conservative views . he remains , however , state governor of carinthia , and observers say the charismatic populist is favored to reclaim his party ’ s leadership position at the october 20 convention .
if this happens , haider is expected to direct the freedom party on a more radical course . in the meantime , schuessel said he would recommend that parliament be dissolved at the earliest possible date , slated to be september 19 .
new elections could be held as early as november , a full year ahead of schedule . haider took a party that garnered just 5 percent in the polls to the second strongest strongest in austria .
in 1999 , it received 27 percent of the vote based on an anti-immigrant , anti-european union platform .
but international boycotts and criticism followed and forced haider to turn over the reins to riess-passer in order for the party to become part of the coalition government . opposition social democrats lead the polls polls show that if elections were held now , schuessel ’ s people ’ s party would get about 29 percent of the vote and the freedom party under 20 percent .
opposition social democrats lead with about 37 percent and the greens have about 12 percent . “ what ’ s happening here is what haider has been aiming at for months , a complete change in the direction of the freedom party , ” innsbruck university political scientist fritz plasser told reuters .
“ haider wants to present issues that will mobilize his voters . ” haider has also been critical in recent months of riess-passer ’ s support of european union expansion in to eastern and central europe .
haider is strongly opposed and is likely to include this as one of the main platform issues should be regain the party ’ s leadership . on sunday , haider delivered an ultimatum from some 400 delegates at a party convention to riess-passer via haider .

the strategy worked well in dealing with regional crises from the balkans to the middle east .
this week , however , with the leaders of europe 's three biggest countries clashing over the best approach in dealing with iraqi leader saddam hussein , the joint policy faces its first major test .
" the achilles ' heel of eu foreign policy " " the developments this week suggest that the joint policy has n't developed as much as has been suggested or people would like , " said daniel keohane , a senior analyst at the center for european reform in london .
" the eu has made tremendous progress in the past 10 years , but there 's no question that there 's discord among the member states .
iraq is the achilles ' heel of eu foreign policy . "
still , it harms the eu not to have a common position , keohane told dw-world .
" it 's frustrating for europeans that it is taking so long to come to a common position , " he said .
" people know that there 's no way countries can influence the u.s. individually .
and the eu 's joint security and foreign policy program wo n't work if the major countries disagree . "
disagreements among europe 's big guns in the united kingdom , prime minister tony blair described hussein as an " international outlaw , " and said that " action would follow " if the iraqi leader refused to allow the return of weapons inspectors .
he also spoke to other eu politicians who have called for greater diplomatic efforts with hussein .
the un , he said , " must be the way to resolve the threat from saddam , not avoid it . "
after meeting with president bush over the weekend , he reiterated his intent to support a u.s. invasion with the aim of toppling hussein .
france , perhaps america 's biggest critic in europe , has also showed signs of supporting military intervention .
president jacques chirac told " the new york times " he wanted hussein out of office and offered a two-part plan for achieving that goal .
chirac said the united nations security council should consider two resolutions – one issuing a tight deadline for iraq to allow weapons inspectors back into the country " without any restrictions or preconditions . "
the other would pave the way for military action if baghdad fails to comply .
but he did n't specify if france would join a u.n.-backed war , adding that the international community needed solid proof that baghdad was developing weapons of mass destruction and that france did not have that information .
if great britain represents hawkish europe , and france the cool middle , then germany has emerged as the eu 's dovish voice in the iraq debate .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who counts his country among america 's biggest allies , has said germany would not participate in a u.s.-led military mission against iraq under any circumstances , even if done under a un mandate .
schröder argues that the war against the taliban and al-qaeda is far from finished and that any effort to strike against hussein would lead to the dissolution of the fragile coalition of countries united in the global anti-terrorism effort .
initially , schröder said he would forge a " german way " in dealing with the u.s. on the iraq issue .
the historically- charged term angered washington and other european leaders .
" a deep crisis , " but is schröder just campaigning ?
at a session of the european parliament in strasbourg last week , joost lagendijk , a dutch member of parliament with the green party , described the rift between europe 's biggest players as a " deep crisis in eu foreign policy . "
but with germany less than two weeks away from an election , some tend to think the crisis could have been artificially created by schröder in order to build up support among left-leaning and pacifist voters .
keohane said many eu policy analysts " tend to feel schröder 's stance is more an election ploy than a hardened policy . "
with almost every other european country willing to consider an iraq invasion , germany would most likely have to get involved , said keohane .
" when it comes down to it , if the u.s. pursues iraq using un channels , it is more likely to find europe falling into line and supporting the military action that would follow later , " keohane said .
" it would also give them time to build public support . "
schröder , for his part , has denied that iraq is an election issue and that he would continue to refuse military engagement even if he is re-elected . debate could have picked a worse time the iraq debate comes at a critical time for europe , which is on the verge of taking on as many as 10 new eastern european members next year and is in the midst of nato enlargement – issues that fuel heated discourse in almost every eu capital .
" when we assess the political risks and possibilities of european involvement in iraq , we must never lose sight of the grand , long-term strategic aims of europe , " said marc houben , a defense policy analyst at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
" the grand , historical political project for europe is its enlargement ...
can any action in iraq put these projects in jeopardy ?
we are not sure .
but we do know that the eu can not risk it , because that would constitute an existential danger . "
still , houben said there could be a silver lining in the contentious debate .
" it often takes a crisis to discover who you are and what you want , " said houben .
" perhaps this is the type of crisis necessary for the eu to discover just what its identity , values , interests and responsibilities really are . " daryl lindsey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

us vice-president dick cheney , an advocate of pre-emptive action to topple saddam hussein , said : " time is not on our side .
" once he 's got a nuclear weapon i think it 'll be virtually impossible to put together an international coalition to deal with this problem , " he said in a us television interview .
cheney is convinced of iraq 's nuclear plans recalling the 30-nation allied coalition mobilised in the 1991 gulf war , mr cheney said that faced with a nuclear-armed iraq " i think most of them would take a pass " .
he also downplayed speculation that the us would make its dossier about iraq 's weapons public .
the us could not risk destroying its " capacity to be able to know what 's going on in a crucial , crucial area , " he said .
blair targets saddam in a key speech to uk trade unions on tuesday , mr blair will insist on decisive action to stop iraq acquiring a nuclear capability .
what sort of iraq do we wake up to after the bombing ?
kofi annan un secretary general " we can not stand by and do nothing .
we should do everything we can to stop him using the weapons he has got and the weapons he wants , " mr blair is expected to say , describing saddam hussein as an " international outlaw " .
among european nations , only britain has voiced support for the us drive to topple saddam hussein .
un secretary-general kofi annan has warned world leaders to think carefully about the consequences of military action against iraq .
mr annan , who has argued that diplomacy should still be allowed to run its course , said it was time for the un security council to make its views heard .
" the question is the morning after .
what sort of iraq do we wake up to after the bombing ? , " mr annan said .
" and what happens in the region ?
what impact would it have ? "
un debate his comments come ahead of the annual un general assembly debate which begins in new york later this week .
among the first speakers is us president george w bush , who is seeking support for his campaign to topple saddam hussein .
un weapons inspectors left iraq in 1998 in a new report published on monday , an influential london think-tank said baghdad could produce a nuclear weapon within months .
however , the international institute for strategic studies said saddam hussein would first need to obtain supplies of radioactive material .
it also concluded that iraq has probably been successful in hiding large stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons from un inspectors , as well as a small number of long-range missiles .
iraqi media tour iraqi officials escorted western reporters to two sites on monday in an effort to show that saddam hussein was not rebuilding sites linked to past nuclear projects or training terrorists .
former un weapons inspector scott ritter , who accompanied reporters to salman pak , 40 kilometres -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- east of baghdad , said the base was being used for anti-hijack training - not for terrorism training .
reporters also toured the al-tammuz reactor site at al-toweitheh , 40 km south of baghdad .
the un says there has been unexplained activity at the site , but the iraqis claim the facility is used for pharmaceutical research .
us diplomatic push mr bush is expected to set out his case for dealing with the threat posed by iraq on thursday .
iraq says it has no desire to build weapons of mass destruction the bbc 's greg barrow at the un in new york says there is much talk among diplomats about the possibility of adopting a new resolution demanding that iraq re-admits un weapons inspectors .
last week , president bush was reported to be considering asking for a resolution that would set a deadline for weapons inspections to resume .
french president jacques chirac has proposed a two-stage plan that could lead to un authorisation of military force against iraq .
such a process would begin with a security council resolution giving baghdad three weeks to readmit arms inspectors .
if iraq failed to comply , another resolution could back the use of force , mr chirac said , appearing to soften france 's previous opposition to us plans . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's barnaby mason " it 's clear the bush administration is trying to get its act together " the bbc 's paul adams " the new report could be useful , with pressure mounting on blair and bush to publish their own dossiers " former weapons inspector scott ritter " iraq has not been shown to possess weapons of mass destruction " full coverage key stories us clerics oppose war saudi war warning iraq polio campaign ' new europe ' hits back analysis blair 's political troubles us and uk regroup blix tiptoes tightrope clickable guide global voices on iraq bbc world service news in arabic audio video inspectors ' report : point by point talking point your views on inspectors ' report see also : 09 sep 02 -pipe- middle east reporters visit suspect iraqi sites 09 sep 02 -pipe- middle east iraq weapons report 09 sep 02 -pipe- americas high stakes for un iraq debate 09 sep 02 -pipe- americas profile : scott ritter 06 sep 02 -pipe- in depth where the world stands on iraq internet links : white house un weapons inspectors iraqi president government of canada the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top americas stories now : us draws up second iraq resolution chicago club owners face charges peru 's ex-spy chief on public trial venezuela signs non-violence pact us plays down n korean threat us struggles to clear snow hacker breaches credit card security bolivian cabinet resigns links to more americas stories are at the foot of the page .

former un weapons inspector scott ritter , who accompanied reporters to salman pak , 40 kilometres -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- east of baghdad , said the base was being used for anti-hijack training - not for terrorism training .
reporters also toured the al-tammuz reactor site at al-toweitheh , 40 km south of baghdad .
the un says there has been unexplained activity at the site , but the iraqis claim the facility is used for pharmaceutical research .
us diplomatic push mr bush is expected to set out his case for dealing with the threat posed by iraq on thursday .
the bbc 's greg barrow at the un in new york says there is much talk among diplomats about the possibility of adopting a new resolution demanding that iraq re-admits un weapons inspectors .
last week , president bush was reported to be considering asking for a resolution that would set a deadline for weapons inspections to resume .
french president jacques chirac has proposed a two-stage plan that could lead to un authorisation of military force against iraq .
such a process would begin with a security council resolution giving baghdad three weeks to readmit arms inspectors .
if iraq failed to comply , another resolution could back the use of force , mr chirac said , appearing to soften france 's previous opposition to us plans .

the breakthrough has come from scientists involved in managing an outbreak in leicester , uk , last year .
about 300 pupils at the crown hills community college in the city were infected with the bacterium after a 14-year-old boy was misdiagnosed with asthma .
it took 10 months before his condition was properly recognised , by which time others in the school had begun to fall ill .
the test , which should aid the management of future outbreaks , was discussed at the british association 's science festival in the city .

the traditional test , known as the tuberculin skin test -lrb- tst -rrb- , or heaf test , can take weeks and can give false-positive results in people who have been given the anti-tb bcg vaccine , or exposed to other similar types of microbes .
professor mike barer , of leicester university , used data from the decoded genome of the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis to search for markers that could be used to isolate the strain involved in any particular outbreak in just two to three hours .

a huge amount of money was invested in sequencing m. tuberculosis .
this is really a very direct application which has been of day to day use to practising physicians . "
such new dna tests will form a key part of the uk government 's tb action plan to be launched next year .
the tests will be used in a wider screening programme and there will also be a new system for fast-track treatment .
the key target for 2003 will be to ensure 90 % of people diagnosed with the disease are treated and cured , and that notification rates in all uk ethnic groups steadily decline .

the who predicts that by 2020 nearly one billion people will be newly infected with tb , of whom 70 million will die .
last year , scientists from oxford university developed a test that was based on analysing blood samples for the presence of immune system cells that are activated by a protein produced by the tb bacterium .
the new leicester test will not be employed as a front-line diagnostic tool to detect the presence of the disease , but it is already being used in identifying the strain involved in an outbreak and studying how this is related to those involved in other cases .

the board is inviting members of the public to join district policing partnerships which will help to shape local priorities and monitor performance .
about 60 people attended a meeting on monday night to find out more about the partnerships , which are being set up in all 26 council areas .
sinn fein has said it will not sit on the new partnerships until the patten recommendations were fully implemented .
work concern was expressed at the meeting about the levels of crime in the carrickfergus area of county antrim .
" we have vandalism , we have burglaries , we have older people frightened - quite a number of them frightened in their homes in the evenings , " said one man .
" i think the dpps are a good idea if they work , but it does seem that the younger generation are not adequately represented , " said one woman .
the board admits there is " no quick fix " to the problems facing policing , but it hopes the district policing partnerships will have a role to play in finding solutions .
last friday , a major campaign to recruit independent members to the partnerships was launched .
as well as locally elected representatives , up to nine other people will sit on each of the 29 consultative bodies .
interviews belfast will have four boards and each of the 25 other district council areas will have one each .
they will operate as sub-committees of the councils , advising on policing priorities and holding police commanders in their areas to account .
they are expected to be up and running by early next year .
people will have the chance to submit applications from 23 september and short listing and interviews will take place between then and november .
sinn fein is the only one of northern ireland 's four main parties which has refused to accept northern ireland 's new policing arrangements following the changeover from the royal ulster constabulary to the police service of northern ireland last november .

the board is inviting members of the public to join district policing partnerships which will help to shape local priorities and monitor performance .
about 60 people attended a meeting on monday night to find out more about the partnerships , which are being set up in all 26 council areas .
sinn fein has said it will not sit on the new partnerships until the patten recommendations were fully implemented .
work concern was expressed at the meeting about the levels of crime in the carrickfergus area of county antrim .
" we have vandalism , we have burglaries , we have older people frightened - quite a number of them frightened in their homes in the evenings , " said one man .
" i think the dpps are a good idea if they work , but it does seem that the younger generation are not adequately represented , " said one woman .
the board admits there is " no quick fix " to the problems facing policing , but it hopes the district policing partnerships will have a role to play in finding solutions .
last friday , a major campaign to recruit independent members to the partnerships was launched .
as well as locally elected representatives , up to nine other people will sit on each of the 29 consultative bodies .
interviews belfast will have four boards and each of the 25 other district council areas will have one each .
they will operate as sub-committees of the councils , advising on policing priorities and holding police commanders in their areas to account .
they are expected to be up and running by early next year .
people will have the chance to submit applications from 23 september and short listing and interviews will take place between then and november .
