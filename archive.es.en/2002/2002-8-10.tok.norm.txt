seven men , aged between 22 and 38 , were convicted of staying in malaysia without valid documents under legislation which came into effect at the end of july .
four indonesians were sentenced to two stokes of the cane .
another indonesian and two bangladeshis were ordered to be whipped once .
the seven were also sentenced to jail terms of between six months and two years .
they will all be deported after serving their sentences .
the migrants are the first to be tried under a new law which stipulates that foreign workers without relevant permits , and anyone who employs or harbours them , can be fined up to 10,000 ringgit -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- , imprisoned for five years and given up to six strokes of the cane .
amnesty period the law came into force after a four-month grace period during which illegal immigrants could leave the country freely with no questions asked .
but government officials say only half the country 's estimated 600,000 illegal immigrants , mainly indonesians , left the country under this amnesty programme .
the sentences against the seven men were handed out by courts in the central state of selangor and the northern island state of penang on friday , officials told the associated press news agency .
the immigration director of central selangor state , che mamat abdullah , told the bernama news agency that a further 13 cases would be brought to court next week , while another 37 cases were currently under investigation .
employment shortages employers and manufacturers have warned that mass deportations could hit the economy hard , as it relies heavily on foreign workers to do jobs that many locals refuse to do .
most immigrants are employed in menial plantation , construction or housekeeping jobs .
property developers say they may suffer serious losses because of a labour shortage , while thousands of hawkers and petty traders may have to close as a result of the crackdown .
malaysia is one of south east asia 's wealthiest countries and acts as a magnet for migrants fleeing poverty and violence in the rest of the region .
on thursday , malaysia and indonesia failed to reach agreement on the fate of illegal migrants .
speaking in bali after a meeting with indonesian president megawati sukarnoputri , malaysian prime minister dr mahathir mohamad said that unemployed foreigners were partly responsible for malaysia 's crime problems .

for some , 3g will stand for girls , gambling and games - the only content that will prove popular on the phones .
mobile expert and managing director of tdk systems nick hunn said users of a trial 3g network in the isle of man have been underwhelmed by their experience .
" the cynical view is that the phones are useful only as hand-warmers because they are big and run hot , " he said .
3g phones will be able to play video clips third generation mobile services were conceived as a huge leap forward in the way we use our phones .
an enormous range of data-based services such as video clips and faster internet services can in theory be offered on the 3g mobile network .
as telecom firms struggle to come to terms with the albatross of debt due to the inflated prices many paid for licenses , critics have suggested that 3g will do more to stifle the development of mobile services than it will to revolutionise it .
it may even result in a two-tiered pricing system with uk consumers losing out .
higher prices mr hunn is representative of many who think telecoms firms were too quick to believe their own hype and blind to the real consequences of their purchase .
" in effect by buying 3g networks at absurd prices , operators have mortgaged the future of mobile telephony .
it was little more than vanity purchasing , " he said .
uk users could end up paying twice as much as someone in scandinavia nick hunn , tdk systems there are vast inequalities in the prices paid for 3g licenses across europe .
in scandinavia , operators paid relatively little up-front , opting instead to give the government a share of profits once services were up and running .
in other countries , including the uk , operators paid billions for the 3g networks .
as many of the big players have interests in a variety of countries , consumers could pay the real price , predicted mr hunn .
" it could be that a two-tier mobile infrastructure develops where consumers in countries that paid the higher license fee subsidising the others .
uk users could end up paying twice as much as someone in scandinavia , " he said .
this autumn will see the 3g ball set in motion in the uk as hutchison becomes the first of the five british operators to roll out a full network .
the rest have delayed their plans , saying it is too early for 3g services .
developments in the rest of europe suggest that not all operators are as brave as hutchison .
in july spanish telecoms firm telefonica decided to cut its losses and ditch its 3g mobile operations in all but the spanish-speaking world .
despite wiping 4.49bn euros off its value for the closure of 3g operations in germany , italy , switzerland and austria , shares immediately rose on the news suggesting share-holders at least were relieved to be free of the burden of 3g .
voice only mr hunn thinks others will follow telefonica 's lead and abandon 3g .
for those that stick with it , he is far from convinced they will persuade people to pay the extra price for data services promised .
hunn : sceptical that users will want 3g " i have immense difficulty understanding the business case that says lets spend hundreds of pounds per user in the hope that people will want to spend their days downloading content , " he said .
" voice will remain the killer application of mobile and i have no faith that something else will replace it , " he said .
a recent survey in the financial times found that significant number of consumers were unexcited by 3g .
nearly half said they were unlikely to use the handsets for anything other than voice .
greedy governments it is estimated that users will have to spend up to 10 times more than they currently do on mobile services to make 3g profitable .
increasingly critics are calling on the governments that set such high prices for the network to allow mobile firms off the hook as the only way of stopping mobile technology from being stifled .
" the lack of understanding government showed when it auctioned the spectrum can not be underestimated .
it seemed to be based on the idea that abject greed was a good policy , " said mr hunn .
" if the government wants to see mobile technology develop it will have to renege on the license fees , " he said .
getting it right some analysts suggest that telecom companies could learn from the experience of offering gprs services , which allow much faster internet access on the go .
new phones could come in all shapes and sizes " operators need to market gprs first and get that right .
then they can begin to migrate users slowly to 3g , " said idc analyst paulo pescatore .
" what services to offer and what price to offer them at will be crucial , " he added .
even the optimists recognise that a developing 3g market will claim victims .
it will also require a " quantum leap " in the way operators market and sell services , suggested gartner analyst nigel deighton .
" there will be hundreds of micro-markets and it will be far more about lifestyle than technology .
operators have to share their clients with others who will understand these new markets , " he said .
gprs will be a good test of how much demand there is for innovative data services .
but rather than providing a stepping stone to 3g , gprs could be as far as consumers want to go , suggested mobile expert justin pearse of new media age .
" as gprs matures and multimedia handset functionality , such as colour screens , becomes standard , much of this content may well provide a compelling enough experience to negate the need for consumer to make the expensive upgrade to 3g , " he said .
moral dilemma the one thing that all commentators do agree on is that the content most likely to drive 3g will be the same that drove the burgeoning technologies of the world wide web .
" it will be the three g 's - girls , gambling and gaming , " said mr hunn .
bringing pornography to our phones could come with its own problems as mobile firms have to balance questions about morals and decency with the need to make money .
" it will be interesting to see how the government and operators react to the first 3g mobile paedophile ring , " pointed out mr hunn .

take steven spielberg 's minority report .
in the film , police officers fly around using jetpacks .
first designed by bell , the helicopter people , in 1961 , it was in fact called the rocket-belt .
there were several different rocket- and jet-powered versions , but they never really caught on due to problems with lack of manoeuvrability , range , and pilot injury on landing .
personal flight is now heading in a new direction .
an american company , millennium jet , have designed a strap on helicopter called the solotrek .
it uses a normal piston engine to drive two fans which the pilot controls using a fly-by-wire system .
if anything breaks or fails a rocket deployed parachute will lower the machine and pilot safely to the ground , even from low altitude .
solotrek is initially aimed at the military , but civilian versions are planned too .
deadly sound jetpacks are not the only sci-fi staple that really exists .
already sonic weapons are being used to knock down opponents .
since the 1960s , researchers have known that very deep noise , below the threshold of human hearing , can cause flesh to resonate , even distort vision .
but it has proven difficult to make a powerful sound generator small enough to be portable , and being able to accurately direct the sound over a distance .
now , using higher frequencies , an mit student has developed a device called an audio spotlight that can focus a tight beam of sound onto one spot several hundred feet away .
a competing company , american technology , is marketing a similar device .
it is also said to be developing a more powerful rifle-sized version called a directed stick radiator , intended for use in psychological warfare and crowd control .
computer control how about newspapers that update themselves ?
well , smart reusable paper is already being sold .
gyriconmedia in the us are one company who markets it .
you would need some sort of wireless link to update the paper , but those are also available now .
but it is the scenes in minority report showing voice and touch-activated computers that have had a lot of people drooling .
why , nearly 30 years after the birth of the pc , are we all still stuck with keyboards and mice , and computers we ca n't properly talk to ?
some of the stuff needed to make a scene like that happen is available now .
however , getting computers to accurately interpret human speech and gestures is more difficult .
it will become possible as chip speeds approach the 10ghz mark because the more times a second a computer can guess at what you 're saying or doing , the more chances it will get it right .
and 10ghz chips are not that far away .
intel have said the current pentium 4 could be pushed up to 10ghz .
the seeds of a lot of these technologies are here now .
what is now needed is copious money for research and development and a willingness from technology companies to take big risks .
clickonline is broadcast on bbc world at various times across the globe .

an american company , millennium jet , have designed a strap on helicopter called the solotrek .
it uses a normal piston engine to drive two fans which the pilot controls using a fly-by-wire system .
if anything breaks or fails a rocket deployed parachute will lower the machine and pilot safely to the ground , even from low altitude .
solotrek is initially aimed at the military , but civilian versions are planned too .
deadly sound jetpacks are not the only sci-fi staple that really exists .
already sonic weapons are being used to knock down opponents .
science fiction : jetpacks in the film since the 1960s , researchers have known that very deep noise , below the threshold of human hearing , can cause flesh to resonate , even distort vision .
but it has proven difficult to make a powerful sound generator small enough to be portable , and being able to accurately direct the sound over a distance .
now , using higher frequencies , an mit student has developed a device called an audio spotlight that can focus a tight beam of sound onto one spot several hundred feet away .
a competing company , american technology , is marketing a similar device .
it is also said to be developing a more powerful rifle-sized version called a directed stick radiator , intended for use in psychological warfare and crowd control .
computer control how about newspapers that update themselves ?
well , smart reusable paper is already being sold .
gyriconmedia in the us are one company who markets it .
science fact : the solotrek craft you would need some sort of wireless link to update the paper , but those are also available now .
but it is the scenes in minority report showing voice and touch-activated computers that have had a lot of people drooling .
why , nearly 30 years after the birth of the pc , are we all still stuck with keyboards and mice , and computers we ca n't properly talk to ?
some of the stuff needed to make a scene like that happen is available now .
however , getting computers to accurately interpret human speech and gestures is more difficult .
it will become possible as chip speeds approach the 10ghz mark because the more times a second a computer can guess at what you 're saying or doing , the more chances it will get it right .
and 10ghz chips are not that far away .
intel have said the current pentium 4 could be pushed up to 10ghz .
the seeds of a lot of these technologies are here now .
what is now needed is copious money for research and development and a willingness from technology companies to take big risks .

at least 72 roseate tern chicks have hatched this year on the tiny coquet island , off the northumberland coast .
the success is thanks to the island warden and his team who made nesting box " terraces " at the beginning of the breeding season .
the dry stone boxes - which come complete with their own patios - have helped produce the biggest hatch since the 1970s .
' growing steadily ' about 75 % of the uk population of roseate terns nest on the 14-acre island .
the roseate terns travel from africa to return to the same nest site each year .
dr paul morrison , of the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- , said there has been a long-term decline in the numbers of the birds breeding in the uk .
he told the bbc : " we are not quite sure why this is happening .
" we have 42 pairs on coquet at the moment and the numbers are going up ever so slowly .
" there was 18 pairs in 1987 and the numbers have been growing steadily since that time .
" the farne islands have only one pair .
" it must be good feeding around here and the habitat seems to be ideal for them . "
a lot of the work done on coquet island has been based on the success of roseate terns on rockabill , dublin .
it was discovered that the birds used the nest boxes in preference to open scrapes as shelter from the weather and predators .
dr morrison added : " this terracing idea with dry stone walls seemed to be the way forward .
" now we have got our own roseate tern terrace at coquet . "
