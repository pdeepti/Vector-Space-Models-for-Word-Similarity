no other german politician possesses a resume as spectacularly varied as joschka fischer . he 's been a street fighter , leftist radical , sneaker-wearing state minister , rabble-rousing opposition leader and a three-piece suit-wearing foreign minister .
the metamorphosis of germany 's most-beloved politician has taken him down many paths .
born in 1948 in gerabronn , fischer never completed school beyond the 10th grade – instead preferring to become a self-taught man .
while living in frankfurt during the 1970s , he became a militant street fighter , a political revolutionary and a book salesman .
he listened to lectures given by german philosophers like theodor adorno , juergen habermas and oskar negt without ever properly enrolling at any university .
taxi driver and sneaker-wearing minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a radical , fischer was involved in the so-called " sponti " scene in frankfurt , so named for the members of a mostly student political group called ausserparlamentarische opposition -lrb- opposition outside of parliament -rrb- .
they lived in squat housing -lrb- photo -rrb- and often held sometimes violent demonstrations .
his involvement with the group created political problems later , when he admitted last year that he beat up a police officer at a demonstration in 1973 .
but fischer departed from the movement earlier than many others , turning his back on the violent practices that made the movement as infamous for its tactics as its political ideas .
eschewing violence , he became a taxi driver in frankfurt and joined the nascent environmentalist green party in 1982 .
from the start of his political career , a politically tempered fischer rejected revolutionary ideas and instead became the intellectual leader of the " realos " wing of the green party , which espoused a pragmatic rather than idealistic course for the environmentalist party .
as a result of its more mainstream politics , the green party attracted enough voters in the state of hesse in 1985 to enter into a coalition with the social democrats there .
fischer became the state 's environment minister .
at his swearing in , he raised eyebrows by wearing shiny white sneakers .
by then , fischer was no stranger to the german political scene .
starting in 1983 , he proved himself to be an exceptionally talented rhetorician as a member of the upper house of parliament , the bundestag .
he put his first serious stamp on the green party 's policies as the secretary of the party 's parliamentary group .
although he never held the highest official position in the party , fischer served as the party 's intellectual leader in the 1990s .
as a result , the party shifted in the direction of the pragmatic realos .
foreign minister and marathon runner as the party 's first and most-effective campaigner , fischer made the greens an acceptable party for wide strata of society .
in 1998 , germans rewarded the party 's efforts with 6.7 percent of the votes , and fischer led the greens into a federal government coalition with the social democratic party .
the spd 's gerhard schröder became chancellor , and fischer became foreign minister .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beginning in 1999 , germany was faced with the difficult decision of whether or not to send peacekeeping troops to macedonia , kosovo and later afghanistan – the issue created a crisis within the green party , which was built on pacifist foundations .
fischer – once an active peace demonstrator – now argued passionately for deployment .
as foreign minister , fischer has been a major proponent of the european union .
he has called for europe to be transformed into a " european federation , " with its laws laid out in an eu-wide constitution .
fischer is also recognized as an important international negotiator in the middle east peace effort between the israelis and palestinians .
the decision marked the end of fischer 's years-long metamorphosis – not just politically , but also in appearance : now he was lithe and lissom .
after his third wife left him about six years ago , fischer undertook a drastic diet in 1996 .
the once-plump politician lost a dramatic amount of weight .
today , fischer is an ascetic who does n't drink alcohol and regularly competes in marathons .
the one-time left-wing militant is now a respected international leader – and part of that success stems from the fact that both his political and personal development happened in the public eye . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic picture of the day chancellor merkel dw-world : angela merkel sworn in as german chancellor dw-world : " kohl 's girl " makes good bilder : chancellor and successor from the fringe have a laugh read about quirky happenings in thigh-slappin ' germany in this dw-world dossier .

phanfone was moving north quickly from its position about 300 kilometres -lrb- 190 miles -rrb- southwest of tokyo , and with winds gusting at up to 145 km / h -lrb- 90 mph -rrb- .
the typhoon was supposed to lash tokyo sometime on monday , the japanese meteorological agency said .
high winds did not deter some beachgoers already , four people have reportedly disappeared off the coast of kanagawa prefecture , west of the capital , in extremely rough seas .
the weather warnings did not stop surfers from trying to take advantage of the waves the typhoon 's winds were pushing ahead of it .
making waves according to the us navy 's joint typhoon warning center , phanfone is causing waves within its storm area as high as 8.5 metres .
phanfone , laotian for animal , was expected to head north up japan 's coast .
it was supposed to hit the small pacific island of hachijojima on sunday .
phanfone , the season 's 13th typhoon , comes about a month after typhoon fengshen hit japan .
that typhoon , which was downgraded to a tropical storm , caused a panamanian freighter to run aground off the south-western coast of japan .
four crew members died in the incident .

this week the pc celebrated its 21st birthday and by this we mean the ibm pc .
there are people who argue over which computer can rightly be called the first pc .
some would say it was the simon computer back in 1950 .
others will tell you it was the build-it-yourself altair introduced in january 1975 .
some insist it was commodore pet in 1976 , one of the first desktop computers with a built-in screen .
and it goes without saying that the vociferous apple crowd will swear blind that the two steves , jobs and wozniak , built the first truly successful pc , the apple ii , in 1977 .
foundations laid but they are all wrong .
the first pc was the ibm pc , launched on 12 august 1981 .
until then we had micros , minis , home computers , personal minicomputers and many more names for the same box .
but it was the ibm that locked the initials pc in stone .
with a modest 4.7mhz 8088 intel processor and 16 kilobytes of memory , the ibm pc took the market by storm .
it ran pc dos 1.0 which ibm had licensed from a young man based in seattle called bill gates .
the world of the late 70s and early 80s was a strange place .
in 99 % of companies the typewriter was used to produce letters and the rest of us used pen and paper .
ibm thought they would sell about 40,000 pcs in the first year .
they got it wrong .
they sold that number in the first couple of months .
toying with dos by the mid-1980s ibm were losing market share to the other manufacturers who joined the pc party .
as a result it targeted the operating system as in need of an upgrade and , with its then best friend microsoft , started work on os / 2 , a new operating system .
it launched os / 2 with a matching pc called the ps / 2 .
dos is dead , said ibm and microsoft alike , long live os / 2 .
ibm promptly waited 18 months to deliver the full version of the software which quickly turned out to be a disastrous move .
reports of dos 's demise were somewhat exaggerated .
the ps / 2 pc was not faring well and it was quietly dropped .
ibm continues to build pcs to this day , though the branding and the company that launched the original has changed almost beyond recognition .
with more than 600 million pcs in use , it is fair to say that this machine 's older , slower sibling launched 21 years ago was one of the most important products of the 20th century .

did you think the johannesburg world summit on sustainable development -lrb- wssd -rrb- would be the preserve of the arran sweatered and besandalled ? "
it is breathtaking the amount of damage mining firms have caused in , say , indonesia " ed matthew , friends of the earth the 60,000 delegates who will attend the two week event include not just sustainable development diehards , and the politicians they have come to lobby .
the event will also place traditional environmentalists beard by jowl with coiffured corporate bosses .
indeed , the strong executive presence at the summit threatens to devalue it , campaigners have warned .
with all that smarm , spin and power pr , business chiefs are poised to hijack an event which is meant to talk about corporations , rather than to them .
how can the summit progress an agenda of holding business to account for despoiling the environment and destroying communities when firms are there pressing political flesh , inviting selected delegates on edited day trips around mines and factories ?
" business people are going to have the ear of ministers , " friends of the earth spokesman ed matthew told bbc news online .
" they are going to dine with them , be in a position where they can have a lot of influence .
" that is not a privilege that can be enjoyed by the communities these businesses are harming . "
leaked letter having spent decades asking corporations to consider environmental issues , the green lobby is now worried they are taking too much notice .
this is perhaps little wonder when oil giant exxon is alleged to have lobbied us president george w bush to boycott the event because it is " anti-freedom , anti-people , anti-globalisation and anti-western " .
" we applaud your decision not to attend in person , " said a letter signed by 31 leading republican parties and conservative lobbyists , many of which are funded by exxon .
" the summit will provide a global media stage for many of the most irresponsible and destructive elements in critical economic and environmental issues , " the letter , leaked to friends of the earth in the us , is reported as saying .
an exxonmobil spokesman dismissed as " ridiculous " the allegation that its support of the lobbyists had led to the letter being sent .
uk team british environmentalists wonder what pressure has been placed on prime minister tony blair .
the uk 's official delegation to the summit includes figures such as bill alexander , chief executive of thames water and sir robert wilson , chairman of mining giant rio tinto , one of the major corporate targets of environmental protest . "
we are not going to talk to a firm which is threatening to start extraction in sulawesi " ed matthew " these kind of people have to be kept in check , " one campaigner told bbc news online .
" otherwise , if they get too much influence , it 's like having al capone helping you draft criminal justice laws . "
while mr blair is believed to be attending the summit for only one day - his office is proving particularly cagey over delegation details - the swiftness of his visit is said to reflect a scepticism of summits rather than of environmental matters .
' breathtaking damage ' yet is n't it fair for firms to have a say at a summit which could have severe repercussions for their profitability ?
many campaigners , for instance , are calling for international regulation to cover the mining industry , an alleged repeat offender of environmental and sociological crimes .
" it is breathtaking the amount of damage mining firms have caused in , say , indonesia , " mr matthew said .
but rio tinto said the industry was already making huge strides in adopting the green mantle , setting up a three year research programme into industry practices , a project which culminated in a conference in toronto in may .
the project highlighted weaknesses in waste disposal , and in the problem posed by abandoned mines which were operating in the industry 's dark ages .
" we are anyway already just about the most regulated industry in the world , " rio spokesman hugh leggatt said .
" think of the processes involved in opening a new mine . "
blanket regulation could even fail the environment , he added , pointing to laws designed to protect sandalwood forests in the philippines .
" when you get there , you can find the locals have chopped all the trees down .
so perhaps it would be advantageous to allow in a mining firm which could then in return promise to do regeneration work . "
stonewalled if mr leggatt has a point , friends of the earth seems little prepared to hear it .
" we are not going to talk to a firm which is threatening to start extraction in sulawesi , a protected area of indonesia , " mr matthew said .
according to mr leggatt , rio decided in 1999 not to pursue the sulawesi plan .
so with ingredients including claim and counter claim , communication breakdown and 60,000 delegates , the scene is set for an eventful , if not fruitful , summit .
enemy number one still , rio tinto and friends of the earth at least agree there are bad guys .
" we do n't want to be lumped with chemicals firms again , " mr leggatt said , haughtily .
" chemicals firms have been at the top of our list of polluting industries , " mr matthew said .
" we have been particularly concerned about them . "
consider it wrong for the likes of shell , ici and bayer to attend the johannesburg summit ?
they could hardly afford not to .
