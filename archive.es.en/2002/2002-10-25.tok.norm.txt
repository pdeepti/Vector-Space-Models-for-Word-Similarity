already , they have made an impassioned plea for closer inter-faith dialogue to address the religious roots of much of the tension .
the call follows an unprecedented meeting in egypt at which leaders of the jewish , christian and muslim communities pledged to promote better understanding of their beliefs and called for a religiously sanctioned ceasefire on all sides .
from the strength of our religions violence must end , institutional violence as well as suicide bombers - we are saying no to it george carey , archbishop of canterbury it is easy to scoff at such gatherings .
sceptics dismiss them as a talking shop for platitudes far removed from the unholy reality of life in israel and the palestinian territories .
but the host of the london talks - the outgoing archbishop of canterbury , dr george carey - was passionate in his defence of the role men and women of faith could play in promoting dialogue .
' ' we are not doing what the politicians should be doing , " he said .
' ' we 're doing what religious leaders should do .
' ' we are contributing from the wealth of our faiths that peace in religion is essential if we 're going to bring peace to the middle east .
from the strength of our religions violence must end ; institutional violence as well as suicide bombers .
we are saying no to it . "
' desecration ' sitting beside each other at the news conference at the end of the first day 's talks were the palestinian minister for religious dialogue , sheikh tal el-sider , and the deputy israeli foreign minister , rabbi michael melchior .
rabbi melchior said there was no escaping the religious reality underpinning the conflict , but added : ' ' for the first time you have central religious leaders who are standing up and saying we are taking responsibility for changing this . "
leaders have called for a religiously-sanctioned ceasefire ' ' violence is not something we sanctify ; it is a desecration of god 's name . "
delegates committed themselves to a 10-point action plan to build trust between their faiths .
it includes a promise to ' ' engage " with those religious leaders who play a part in perpetuating violence .
it also plans to promote mutual tolerance and understanding in schools .
much of the rest , though , looks suspiciously like a charter for endless discussion .
and there is the danger that for all the passionate commitment of the leaders themselves they could talk themselves out of any real relevance to the world in which their followers live and die .

in an interview with bbc news ms morris said she had " been honest with herself " and thought she had not been as good at the cabinet post as in her old job as schools standards minister .
the former teacher has come under sustained pressure in recent weeks in the wake of the debacle over a-level marking and delays in vetting teachers for the new school year . "
i 'm not having second best in a job that 's as important as this " estelle morris there were further calls for her to quit after she tried to intervene when an appeals panel reinstated two boys expelled for threatening a teacher .
her departure has prompted speculation about who will replace ms morris as secretary of state and has opened up the possibility of a cabinet reshuffle .
ms morris was cheered and clapped by civil servants as she left the department for education and skills on wednesday night .
several officials even broke down in tears as she walked out .
she was escorted to her car by deputy prime minister john prescott , who kissed her on the cheek as she left .
this week the former teacher had faced more trouble over an apparent failure to honour her own promise to resign if education targets were missed .
tony blair 's official spokesman said the prime minister had " accepted her resignation with regret " and government sources were reported as saying she had not been asked to leave her post .
' different skills ' ms morris said she had felt more comfortable in her previous role as schools minister than as a secretary of state taking big strategic decisions and running a " huge " department .
" if i 'm really honest with myself i have not enjoyed it as much and i just do not think i 'm as good at it as i was at my other job .
" i 'm not having second best in a job as important as this . "
but she denied feeling out-of-her depth and said she was proud of her achievements .
she also said she thought she could justify herself in each of the recent controversies that had hit her tenure .
ms morris has endured the full glare of the media spotlight in recent days and admitted she had found that difficult .
" i do not find the modern media and how they relate to politics easy , " she continued , explaining it had not been a factor in her resignation .
the outgoing minister said she found some media coverage " intrusive " but said she was not critical of journalists .
blair talks in her resignation letter to mr blair , ms morris said : " all this has meant that with some of the recent situations i have been involved in i have not felt i have been as effective as i should be or as effective as you need me to be . "
mr blair met ms morris on tuesday to discuss her wish to resign and he told her to think about it overnight .
she said she had done that and was " absolutely sure " she wanted to go .
in a letter to ms morris , the prime minister said he was certain she would return to government .
" i have no doubt you are doing an excellent job , as i said to you and i have full confidence in you , " said mr blair .
labour chairman charles clarke , a former schools minister , trade secretary patricia hewitt , europe minister peter hain and schools minister david miliband are being touted as possible successors to ms morris .
despite the intense volley of attacks on her in recent weeks , ms morris has tried to tough out demands for her departure .
news that she has gone has come as a dramatic surprise at westminster .
in the most recent controversy to land on her desk , ms morris was accused of misleading a committee of mps by denying she had made a promise to resign if targets were not met .
in 1999 , as education minister ms morris said she would resign if the government failed to meet its targets on numeracy and literacy in 2002 .
the targets were not met but ms morris said she would prefer to aim high and miss than set objectives that were too easy to meet .
' sincere politician ' john dunford , from the secondary headteachers ' association , told bbc news 24 he was " disappointed and surprised " to hear ms morris had resigned .
dr dunford praised ms morris as a very sincere politician who was completely committed to improving schools standards .

conservative shadow education secretary damian green said ms morris ' failure was the failure of the government 's education policy .
" she has lost the confidence of parents and pupils in her ability to run our schools , " he said .
liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said : " i am personally sorry for estelle morris .
" her resignation is an opportunity for a fresh start for the government 's entire approach to the education system . "

yet , the trailer was shown in cinemas , together with other trailers for actual movies , long after the adverts had left the screen .

" we 're entertainment that just happens to have a bmw in the script , " insisted bmw north america marketing executive , jim mcdowell .
" it 's taking a brand and creating an entertainment vehicle around it . "
bmw 's movies are not made on the cheap .
the production company operates with $ 10m budgets for the 10 minute movies .
stars like guy ritchie , ang lee and john frankenheimer , as well as john woo and tony scott , have directed the films .
and 14 million people saw the first series of bmw movies which were distributed via the internet .
bmw 's next two movies , ticker and beat the devil , will be released in november .
mercedes advertainment a similar ploy was pulled by daimlerchrysler this summer .
director michael mann made a fast and furious trailer for a thriller starring benicio del toro as a stock market guru with a taste for the high life of gambling and zooming around in a mercedes convertible .
only , the movie itself was never made .
yet , the trailer was shown in cinemas , together with other trailers for actual movies , long after the adverts had left the screen .
the advertainment ended with the promise : " coming soon " ; a reference , apparently , to the new mercedes sl - not to a forthcoming movie .

talks on thursday between the deputy prime minister and the fire brigades ' union -lrb- fbu -rrb- - just days before the strikes are due to start - were called " constructive " .
andy gilchrist , general secretary of the fbu , said friday 's meeting would continue the " difficult discussions " .
tell us what you think .
click here to go straight to our email form the meetings came as a poll suggested just over half of the public supported the firefighters ' campaign for a 40 % pay rise , from just over £ 21,000 to £ 30,000 .
strike dates 29- 31 october 2-4 november 6-14 november 22-30 november 4-12 december 16-24 december all start and end at 0900 gmt a vote on bbc news online indicated that almost 60 % of 22,000 readers were against the strike , with just over 40 % supporting strike action .
the walkout is due to start on tuesday but mr gilchrist said both sides had left the talks on thursday evening to consider a " range of issues " .
the meeting had been scheduled to last only half an hour but the talks ran on for more than two hours , prompting speculation a deal could be thrashed out .
leaving the meeting at the cabinet office in london , mr gilchrist said : " i have had a very constructive dialogue with john prescott and we are looking at a range of issues which are all related to the pay dispute inside the fire service .
" we will be going away to consider those on both respective sides . "
john prescott has urged firefighters to accept the pay review so far , local authority employers have offered only a 4 % rise to the firefighters .
any more would have to be met by national government .
but on thursday new party chairman dr john reid indicated that the government would not meet large public sector pay claims without substantial reform . : public worker pay how the salaries compare full-time firefighters are planning to begin the series of walkouts on 29 october .
strikes will last for up to eight days at a time , and are planned to take place over 36 days .
in the event of industrial action , the army - backed by the royal navy and raf - is on standby to provide cover with 827 green goddess fire engines .
they will be joined by 4,000 part-time firefighters with the retained firefighters union -lrb- rfu -rrb- , who have condemned the fbu 's action .
unions have claimed workers from other sectors are considering staying at home on strike days because of safety concerns .

investors forecast that the scheme , being unveiled on wednesday , would prove more lenient than the tough prescription proposed by financial services minister heizo takenaka - who favours the scorched-earth approach to the banking crisis .
" there is likely to be a concession given fierce opposition from ruling party lawmakers and top banks ' recent warnings of a serious credit crunch , " said tetsuya ishijima , senior investment strategist at okasan securities .
japanese media warned that banks might launch legal action if the reform package proved too unpalatable .
tokyo shares ended 1.3 % higher , with shares in banks among the gainers .
bank suspicions mr takenaka still insists that his plan will not be watered down , despite fears over their impact .
he would stiffen rules on how much capital banks have to carry , a measure likely to prompt bankruptcies among heavily indebted borrowers .
mr takenaka will meet bank chiefs later on friday , in an attempt to get them onside .
bank bosses , likely to find their jobs threatened by a wholesale sector shake-up , have resisted previous overtures .
political fears a hardcore approach to the bank crisis could also have political implications , if bankruptcies led to job losses .
mr takenaka 's package has been delayed once , largely thanks to heavy lobbying of prime minister junichiro koizumi by worried members of his liberal democratic party .
having been in power for all but a couple of the past 50 years , ldp politicians have influential power bases in industries such as construction and real estate likely to be hit by a rigorous bad debt package .
partly because of this pressure , mr koizumi has so far resisted declaring a state of economic emergency , without which public funds can not be injected into the banking system .
bank debts are officially estimated at 50 trillion yen , but unofficially feared to be three or four times higher .

home secretary david blunkett visited the valleys , which are being rocked by a spiralling rise in heroin and cocaine use and by consequent drug-related deaths and crime .
the extra money comes after labour politicians lobbied the home secretary at the party 's conference in blackpool .
the cash injection will be matched by police to boost the crime-fighting fund by £ 2m over the next two years . "
the disaster of unemployment leads to hopelessness and communities falling apart - drugs throw petrol on that fire " david blunkett it will go directly to operation tarian - an armed crackdown on the sale by " middle men " in south wales of cheap narcotics from across offa 's dyke - jointly run by the region 's three police forces .
police chiefs have said the threat from drugs is the biggest danger facing the valleys .
they say communities are being " ripped apart " by hard drugs and associated crime - and could be destroyed completely if heroin and cocaine are not removed .
some of the cheapest supplies in the uk are said to be flooding the region from bristol and birmingham - police and politicians want to smash those gangs .
heroin arrests rocketed by 80 % in the year to april , according to south wales police .
seizures of heroin in the four months to august equalled those in all of 2000 .
crack cocaine seizures in the same period equalled those in 1999 and 2000 together .
the number of registered drug users increased by 14 % in the six months to august .
rehabilitation delays some parents have accused the welsh assembly government of failing their addict children by not providing comprehensive rehabilitation and detoxification programmes quick enough .
in july , the welsh assembly government promised to bankroll the police 's drugs crackdown if the uk government could not stump up cash .
it is unclear whether the sum from the home office means that pledge still has to be on the table .
mr blunkett was made more aware of south wales ' drugs problem at his october meeting with the region 's mps - a delegation led by labour rhondda member chris bryant .
the home secretary had said the group had " made a good business case " .
" this problem is growing , " mr blunkett said ahead of his visit on friday , blaming a " failure of investment " under previous administrations .
" in our early years , -lsb- the government -rsb- was beginning to struggle with this problem without having the resources linked up to policing which would make the difference . "
he said he would publish a revised drugs strategy within three months .
the home secretary visited the cynon valley - one of the communities complaining about the drugs problem .
he then had a meeting with cynon valley mp ann clwyd and cynon valley am christine chapman .
mr blunkett 's visit coincided with the inquests in merthyr tydfil of two drug users .
gavin dwyer , 18 , collapsed in a local nightclub after taking amphetamine and ecstasy .
his mother is angry the crown prosecution service decided there was not enough evidence to prosecute a man arrested after the death .
the family of 23-year-old robert may heard how he had died of the affects of a heroin overdose .
in an apparently unrelated investigation , south wales police are questioning five men in connection with drugs worth more than £ 500,000 seized in a raid on seven maesteg houses .
