dw-radio looks back . looking back over the year 2002 you can only shake your head in disbelief at the optimism emanating from the german government at the beginning of the year .
indeed in january the government believed germany had reached an economic turning point and was heading for a new upturn .
speaking in berlin at the end of january , german finance minister , hans eichel , declared that the economy would stay weak for a while , but would pick up strongly by the middle of the year at the latest .
he was , however , realistic enough to predict that economic weakness would continue to have an effect on employment .
' the average for unemployment over the year should be just under four million and the unemployment rate , at 9.5 per cent , about the same level as last year .
this is certainly not satisfactory but i would like to remind you that in january 1998 there were around 4.8 million jobless , that 's over 500,000 more . '
budget deficit headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- aimed to reduce debt by 2005 and , in 2006 - for the first time in decades - be able to present a balanced budget .
with an overall state deficit of 2.7 per cent , financial planning at the beginning of the year foresaw germany keeping within the limits of the eu stability pact .
the eu 's stability and growth pact stipulates that states ' deficits may not exceed three percent of gross domestic product , and member countries must aim for broadly balanced budgets .
as germany came dangerously close to breaching the stability pact ’ s 3 percent deficit ceiling , it narrowly escaped a formal warning from brussels - a move that would have proved embarrassing for germany .
despite the close shave in february , critical voices were being raised about germany 's poor growth rate and its effects .
eckhardt wohlers , economic expert from the hamburg world economic archives , hwwa , said , " with this growth rate , germany is at the lower end of the european league .
such a growth rate will not be enough to improve the situation on the job market .
the number of those out of work will increase this year and the yearly average will climb to almost four million . "
fears that euro could trigger price rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oversized 100 euro banknote along with rising unemployment , the german public began to find fault with the new currency , the euro .
millions of consumers in germany had been complaining about price rises since the beginning of the year .
they suspected that retailers had used the changeover from marks to euro to make hefty price increases .
the euro quickly gained the reputation of being an inflation-maker .
the pessimistic mood among consumers had its effect on retail markets .
the spokesman for the retailer traders ' association , hermann franzen once again reduced the forecast turnover levels , in a sector which has been suffering for years .
" consumers are pessimistic , fearful and despondent .
they are seriously worried about their future and , unfortunately , they are daily confirmed in their convictions by negative reports .
necessities are being purchased , but no extras , no luxuries or fun items , " franzen said .
unemployment scandal sets alarm bells ringing in addition to euro worries , a scandal involving the procedures of the federal labor office broke out in march , further undermining the public ’ s confidence .
it was discovered that the local bureaus of the labor office had been dramatically inflating job-placement statistics , by as much as 70 percent ; they had found jobs for far fewer people than they claimed .
the labor office scandal forced the government to taken swift action .
in a first step it was decided to use more of the office 's workforce for finding employment for job-seekers .
the federal employment office also received a new man at the helm , social democrat florian gerster .
in addition a commission led by peter hartz , a member of the board of volkswagen , was set up to propose widespread reforms of the federal employment office and the job market .
the aim of the hartz commission was ambitious : within three years the number of unemployed in germany was to be halved from the current four million to two million people the former federal employment minister , walter riester , was clear that the government was anxious for good results . " you see , the legislature is proceeding as quickly as possible , and the fact that we have asked the commission to come up with a solution by the august 15 or 16 , is pointing in the same direction .
we have a great interest in coming to good solutions quickly and translating them quickly and well into policy , " he said .
it 's the economy stupid !
germany ’ s poor economy also paid a central role in the election campaign which picked up in august for the elections scheduled on september 22 .
the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its smaller bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- raced past chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats in opinion polls with their emphasis on the economy .
as the economic mood in germany worsened , opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber had an easy task , portraying the chancellors ’ s " politics with a steady hand " as simply doing nothing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber said a change of mood among the middleclasses was needed , as well as a new political framework for economic growth .
" the middle classes are deeply disappointed with this government and the whole depressing climate is , so to speak , raining on the whole population .
a change of government will without doubt mean a psychological boost . "
floods a blessing in disguise for schröder a change of government seemed almost certain in germany .
but things turned out quite differently with the onslaught of heavy floods in the middle of august , which inundated large parts of eastern germany and wreaked its economy .
amidst this national disaster , chancellor schröder was able to confirm his reputation as a driving force as he proclaimed his solidarity with the flood victims and freed up huge sums of money in rapid aid .
in order to pay for the damages worth billions caused by the flood disaster , the tax reform with its planned reductions for individuals and businesses , which was due to come into effect in 2003 , was postponed for a year .
an extraordinary situation demanded extraordinary measures , schröder said at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder " we have decided , to postpone by a year , the tax reductions due to come into force in 2003 .
this will make 6.9 billion euro available .
of this a little more than three billion euro will come from the federal sources , 2.8 billion from the regions , and a billion from local authorities , " he said in a speech .
schröder ’ s handling of the floods gained him a lot of sympathy from voters in eastern germany .
the electorate also rewarded schröder for the fact that he had no intention of getting involved in a war against iraq .
schröder 's social democrats together with their junior coalition partner , the greens managed a narrow election victory .
government in for rude shock but trouble was in store for the newly reelected government as the true state of the country ’ s dire financial state came to light .
coalition talks with the greens in mid-october revealed that germany needed to borrow more than planned , and taxes for companies and private individuals would rise .
the tightrope walk between borrowing and saving , agreed between the social democrats and the greens , came up against virulent protests from the opposition and from employers ' associations .
the leader of the csu , edmund stoiber said that millions of people felt they had been cheated by a government that was blatantly reneging on its electoral promises .
the cdu leader , angela merkel , came to a similar conclusion .
" the new rules for the environment tax , alone , lead to a further weakening of germany as a location for investment , and like a red thread running through the coalition agreement are the missing power , the missing courage , to truly renew germany , to cut through the knots and set the signals for growth and employment , " she said .
inevitable tax hikes amongt other things , the government intends to limit the opportunity for businesses to offset past losses against later profits .
economic expert herbert hax , a member of the economic ministry 's scientific advisory committee , said that the abolition of this ' loss carried forward ' means that a part of the latest tax reform will be withdrawn .
' it is not a tax reduction , just normal taxation according to ability to pay .
if that is now limited , it will be a considerable extra burden on business . '
the contributions to pension insurance are also set to rise – from 19.1 to 19.5 per cent of wages .
the president of the munich ifo institute hans-werner sinn said it would be damaging to employment .
" businesses already have great incentives to lay people off , because they are too expensive .
and this just adds to that , " he said .
" it could n't be worse " ' it could n't be worse ' - that was the conclusion of the economic survey carried out in the autum by the german chamber for industry and commerce , dihk , amongst 25,000 businesses from across the country .
the mood is at a low ebb , according to the general manager of the dihk , martin wansleben .
' we did n't expect it to get that bad .
it caused a certain bewilderment and for a short while a certain helplessness as well .
what has now been agreed by the coalition is economically crazy and aimed short-sightedly at the year 2003 .
germany will lose potential for growth , if that is all that the government has offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . '
black wednesday for government but there was worse ahead for finance minister hans eichel .
in what is now known as " black wednesday " , november 13 brought a torrent of bad economic news .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
given this bleak economic data , it 's hard to find any remains of the optimism with which the government began the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de black week for german chancellor the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .

dw-radio looks back . looking back over the year 2002 you can only shake your head in disbelief at the optimism emanating from the german government at the beginning of the year .
indeed in january the government believed germany had reached an economic turning point and was heading for a new upturn .
speaking in berlin at the end of january , german finance minister , hans eichel , declared that the economy would stay weak for a while , but would pick up strongly by the middle of the year at the latest .
he was , however , realistic enough to predict that economic weakness would continue to have an effect on employment .
' the average for unemployment over the year should be just under four million and the unemployment rate , at 9.5 per cent , about the same level as last year .
this is certainly not satisfactory but i would like to remind you that in january 1998 there were around 4.8 million jobless , that 's over 500,000 more . '
budget deficit headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- aimed to reduce debt by 2005 and , in 2006 - for the first time in decades - be able to present a balanced budget .
with an overall state deficit of 2.7 per cent , financial planning at the beginning of the year foresaw germany keeping within the limits of the eu stability pact .
the eu 's stability and growth pact stipulates that states ' deficits may not exceed three percent of gross domestic product , and member countries must aim for broadly balanced budgets .
as germany came dangerously close to breaching the stability pact ’ s 3 percent deficit ceiling , it narrowly escaped a formal warning from brussels - a move that would have proved embarrassing for germany .
despite the close shave in february , critical voices were being raised about germany 's poor growth rate and its effects .
eckhardt wohlers , economic expert from the hamburg world economic archives , hwwa , said , " with this growth rate , germany is at the lower end of the european league .
such a growth rate will not be enough to improve the situation on the job market .
the number of those out of work will increase this year and the yearly average will climb to almost four million . "
fears that euro could trigger price rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oversized 100 euro banknote along with rising unemployment , the german public began to find fault with the new currency , the euro .
millions of consumers in germany had been complaining about price rises since the beginning of the year .
they suspected that retailers had used the changeover from marks to euro to make hefty price increases .
the euro quickly gained the reputation of being an inflation-maker .
the pessimistic mood among consumers had its effect on retail markets .
the spokesman for the retailer traders ' association , hermann franzen once again reduced the forecast turnover levels , in a sector which has been suffering for years .
" consumers are pessimistic , fearful and despondent .
they are seriously worried about their future and , unfortunately , they are daily confirmed in their convictions by negative reports .
necessities are being purchased , but no extras , no luxuries or fun items , " franzen said .
unemployment scandal sets alarm bells ringing in addition to euro worries , a scandal involving the procedures of the federal labor office broke out in march , further undermining the public ’ s confidence .
it was discovered that the local bureaus of the labor office had been dramatically inflating job-placement statistics , by as much as 70 percent ; they had found jobs for far fewer people than they claimed .
the labor office scandal forced the government to taken swift action .
in a first step it was decided to use more of the office 's workforce for finding employment for job-seekers .
the federal employment office also received a new man at the helm , social democrat florian gerster .
in addition a commission led by peter hartz , a member of the board of volkswagen , was set up to propose widespread reforms of the federal employment office and the job market .
the aim of the hartz commission was ambitious : within three years the number of unemployed in germany was to be halved from the current four million to two million people the former federal employment minister , walter riester , was clear that the government was anxious for good results . " you see , the legislature is proceeding as quickly as possible , and the fact that we have asked the commission to come up with a solution by the august 15 or 16 , is pointing in the same direction .
we have a great interest in coming to good solutions quickly and translating them quickly and well into policy , " he said .
it 's the economy stupid !
germany ’ s poor economy also paid a central role in the election campaign which picked up in august for the elections scheduled on september 22 .
the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its smaller bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- raced past chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats in opinion polls with their emphasis on the economy .
as the economic mood in germany worsened , opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber had an easy task , portraying the chancellors ’ s " politics with a steady hand " as simply doing nothing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber said a change of mood among the middleclasses was needed , as well as a new political framework for economic growth .
" the middle classes are deeply disappointed with this government and the whole depressing climate is , so to speak , raining on the whole population .
a change of government will without doubt mean a psychological boost . "
floods a blessing in disguise for schröder a change of government seemed almost certain in germany .
but things turned out quite differently with the onslaught of heavy floods in the middle of august , which inundated large parts of eastern germany and wreaked its economy .
amidst this national disaster , chancellor schröder was able to confirm his reputation as a driving force as he proclaimed his solidarity with the flood victims and freed up huge sums of money in rapid aid .
in order to pay for the damages worth billions caused by the flood disaster , the tax reform with its planned reductions for individuals and businesses , which was due to come into effect in 2003 , was postponed for a year .
an extraordinary situation demanded extraordinary measures , schröder said at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder " we have decided , to postpone by a year , the tax reductions due to come into force in 2003 .
this will make 6.9 billion euro available .
of this a little more than three billion euro will come from the federal sources , 2.8 billion from the regions , and a billion from local authorities , " he said in a speech .
schröder ’ s handling of the floods gained him a lot of sympathy from voters in eastern germany .
the electorate also rewarded schröder for the fact that he had no intention of getting involved in a war against iraq .
schröder 's social democrats together with their junior coalition partner , the greens managed a narrow election victory .

it 's the economy stupid !
germany ’ s poor economy also paid a central role in the election campaign which picked up in august for the elections scheduled on september 22 .

in order to pay for the damages worth billions caused by the flood disaster , the tax reform with its planned reductions for individuals and businesses , which was due to come into effect in 2003 , was postponed for a year .

dw-radio looks back . looking back over the year 2002 you can only shake your head in disbelief at the optimism emanating from the german government at the beginning of the year .
indeed in january the government believed germany had reached an economic turning point and was heading for a new upturn .
speaking in berlin at the end of january , german finance minister , hans eichel , declared that the economy would stay weak for a while , but would pick up strongly by the middle of the year at the latest .
he was , however , realistic enough to predict that economic weakness would continue to have an effect on employment .
' the average for unemployment over the year should be just under four million and the unemployment rate , at 9.5 per cent , about the same level as last year .
this is certainly not satisfactory but i would like to remind you that in january 1998 there were around 4.8 million jobless , that 's over 500,000 more . '
budget deficit headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- aimed to reduce debt by 2005 and , in 2006 - for the first time in decades - be able to present a balanced budget .
with an overall state deficit of 2.7 per cent , financial planning at the beginning of the year foresaw germany keeping within the limits of the eu stability pact .
the eu 's stability and growth pact stipulates that states ' deficits may not exceed three percent of gross domestic product , and member countries must aim for broadly balanced budgets .
as germany came dangerously close to breaching the stability pact ’ s 3 percent deficit ceiling , it narrowly escaped a formal warning from brussels - a move that would have proved embarrassing for germany .
despite the close shave in february , critical voices were being raised about germany 's poor growth rate and its effects .
eckhardt wohlers , economic expert from the hamburg world economic archives , hwwa , said , " with this growth rate , germany is at the lower end of the european league .
such a growth rate will not be enough to improve the situation on the job market .
the number of those out of work will increase this year and the yearly average will climb to almost four million . "
fears that euro could trigger price rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oversized 100 euro banknote along with rising unemployment , the german public began to find fault with the new currency , the euro .
millions of consumers in germany had been complaining about price rises since the beginning of the year .
they suspected that retailers had used the changeover from marks to euro to make hefty price increases .
the euro quickly gained the reputation of being an inflation-maker .
the pessimistic mood among consumers had its effect on retail markets .
the spokesman for the retailer traders ' association , hermann franzen once again reduced the forecast turnover levels , in a sector which has been suffering for years .
" consumers are pessimistic , fearful and despondent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.12.2002 rough ride for german economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's economic powerhouse floundered in 2002 weak growth , rising unemployment , gaping budget deficits , devastating floods , a rude awakening after the election – from the point of view of the german economy , 2002 was anything but good .
dw-radio looks back . looking back over the year 2002 you can only shake your head in disbelief at the optimism emanating from the german government at the beginning of the year .
indeed in january the government believed germany had reached an economic turning point and was heading for a new upturn .
speaking in berlin at the end of january , german finance minister , hans eichel , declared that the economy would stay weak for a while , but would pick up strongly by the middle of the year at the latest .
he was , however , realistic enough to predict that economic weakness would continue to have an effect on employment .
' the average for unemployment over the year should be just under four million and the unemployment rate , at 9.5 per cent , about the same level as last year .
this is certainly not satisfactory but i would like to remind you that in january 1998 there were around 4.8 million jobless , that 's over 500,000 more . '
budget deficit headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- aimed to reduce debt by 2005 and , in 2006 - for the first time in decades - be able to present a balanced budget .
with an overall state deficit of 2.7 per cent , financial planning at the beginning of the year foresaw germany keeping within the limits of the eu stability pact .
the eu 's stability and growth pact stipulates that states ' deficits may not exceed three percent of gross domestic product , and member countries must aim for broadly balanced budgets .
as germany came dangerously close to breaching the stability pact ’ s 3 percent deficit ceiling , it narrowly escaped a formal warning from brussels - a move that would have proved embarrassing for germany .
despite the close shave in february , critical voices were being raised about germany 's poor growth rate and its effects .
eckhardt wohlers , economic expert from the hamburg world economic archives , hwwa , said , " with this growth rate , germany is at the lower end of the european league .
such a growth rate will not be enough to improve the situation on the job market .
the number of those out of work will increase this year and the yearly average will climb to almost four million . "
fears that euro could trigger price rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oversized 100 euro banknote along with rising unemployment , the german public began to find fault with the new currency , the euro .
millions of consumers in germany had been complaining about price rises since the beginning of the year .
they suspected that retailers had used the changeover from marks to euro to make hefty price increases .
the euro quickly gained the reputation of being an inflation-maker .
the pessimistic mood among consumers had its effect on retail markets .
the spokesman for the retailer traders ' association , hermann franzen once again reduced the forecast turnover levels , in a sector which has been suffering for years .
" consumers are pessimistic , fearful and despondent .
they are seriously worried about their future and , unfortunately , they are daily confirmed in their convictions by negative reports .
necessities are being purchased , but no extras , no luxuries or fun items , " franzen said .
unemployment scandal sets alarm bells ringing in addition to euro worries , a scandal involving the procedures of the federal labor office broke out in march , further undermining the public ’ s confidence .
it was discovered that the local bureaus of the labor office had been dramatically inflating job-placement statistics , by as much as 70 percent ; they had found jobs for far fewer people than they claimed .
the labor office scandal forced the government to taken swift action .
in a first step it was decided to use more of the office 's workforce for finding employment for job-seekers .
the federal employment office also received a new man at the helm , social democrat florian gerster .
in addition a commission led by peter hartz , a member of the board of volkswagen , was set up to propose widespread reforms of the federal employment office and the job market .
the aim of the hartz commission was ambitious : within three years the number of unemployed in germany was to be halved from the current four million to two million people the former federal employment minister , walter riester , was clear that the government was anxious for good results . " you see , the legislature is proceeding as quickly as possible , and the fact that we have asked the commission to come up with a solution by the august 15 or 16 , is pointing in the same direction .
we have a great interest in coming to good solutions quickly and translating them quickly and well into policy , " he said .
it 's the economy stupid !
germany ’ s poor economy also paid a central role in the election campaign which picked up in august for the elections scheduled on september 22 .
the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its smaller bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- raced past chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats in opinion polls with their emphasis on the economy .
as the economic mood in germany worsened , opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber had an easy task , portraying the chancellors ’ s " politics with a steady hand " as simply doing nothing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber said a change of mood among the middleclasses was needed , as well as a new political framework for economic growth .
" the middle classes are deeply disappointed with this government and the whole depressing climate is , so to speak , raining on the whole population .
a change of government will without doubt mean a psychological boost . "
floods a blessing in disguise for schröder a change of government seemed almost certain in germany .
but things turned out quite differently with the onslaught of heavy floods in the middle of august , which inundated large parts of eastern germany and wreaked its economy .
amidst this national disaster , chancellor schröder was able to confirm his reputation as a driving force as he proclaimed his solidarity with the flood victims and freed up huge sums of money in rapid aid .
in order to pay for the damages worth billions caused by the flood disaster , the tax reform with its planned reductions for individuals and businesses , which was due to come into effect in 2003 , was postponed for a year .
an extraordinary situation demanded extraordinary measures , schröder said at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder " we have decided , to postpone by a year , the tax reductions due to come into force in 2003 .
this will make 6.9 billion euro available .
of this a little more than three billion euro will come from the federal sources , 2.8 billion from the regions , and a billion from local authorities , " he said in a speech .
schröder ’ s handling of the floods gained him a lot of sympathy from voters in eastern germany .
the electorate also rewarded schröder for the fact that he had no intention of getting involved in a war against iraq .
schröder 's social democrats together with their junior coalition partner , the greens managed a narrow election victory .
government in for rude shock but trouble was in store for the newly reelected government as the true state of the country ’ s dire financial state came to light .
coalition talks with the greens in mid-october revealed that germany needed to borrow more than planned , and taxes for companies and private individuals would rise .
the tightrope walk between borrowing and saving , agreed between the social democrats and the greens , came up against virulent protests from the opposition and from employers ' associations .
the leader of the csu , edmund stoiber said that millions of people felt they had been cheated by a government that was blatantly reneging on its electoral promises .
the cdu leader , angela merkel , came to a similar conclusion .
" the new rules for the environment tax , alone , lead to a further weakening of germany as a location for investment , and like a red thread running through the coalition agreement are the missing power , the missing courage , to truly renew germany , to cut through the knots and set the signals for growth and employment , " she said .
inevitable tax hikes amongt other things , the government intends to limit the opportunity for businesses to offset past losses against later profits .
economic expert herbert hax , a member of the economic ministry 's scientific advisory committee , said that the abolition of this ' loss carried forward ' means that a part of the latest tax reform will be withdrawn .
' it is not a tax reduction , just normal taxation according to ability to pay .
if that is now limited , it will be a considerable extra burden on business . '
the contributions to pension insurance are also set to rise – from 19.1 to 19.5 per cent of wages .
the president of the munich ifo institute hans-werner sinn said it would be damaging to employment .
" businesses already have great incentives to lay people off , because they are too expensive .
and this just adds to that , " he said .
" it could n't be worse " ' it could n't be worse ' - that was the conclusion of the economic survey carried out in the autum by the german chamber for industry and commerce , dihk , amongst 25,000 businesses from across the country .
the mood is at a low ebb , according to the general manager of the dihk , martin wansleben .
' we did n't expect it to get that bad .
it caused a certain bewilderment and for a short while a certain helplessness as well .
what has now been agreed by the coalition is economically crazy and aimed short-sightedly at the year 2003 .
germany will lose potential for growth , if that is all that the government has offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . '
black wednesday for government but there was worse ahead for finance minister hans eichel .
in what is now known as " black wednesday " , november 13 brought a torrent of bad economic news .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
given this bleak economic data , it 's hard to find any remains of the optimism with which the government began the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de black week for german chancellor the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .

dw-radio looks back . looking back over the year 2002 you can only shake your head in disbelief at the optimism emanating from the german government at the beginning of the year .
indeed in january the government believed germany had reached an economic turning point and was heading for a new upturn .
speaking in berlin at the end of january , german finance minister , hans eichel , declared that the economy would stay weak for a while , but would pick up strongly by the middle of the year at the latest .
he was , however , realistic enough to predict that economic weakness would continue to have an effect on employment .
' the average for unemployment over the year should be just under four million and the unemployment rate , at 9.5 per cent , about the same level as last year .
this is certainly not satisfactory but i would like to remind you that in january 1998 there were around 4.8 million jobless , that 's over 500,000 more . '
budget deficit headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- aimed to reduce debt by 2005 and , in 2006 - for the first time in decades - be able to present a balanced budget .
with an overall state deficit of 2.7 per cent , financial planning at the beginning of the year foresaw germany keeping within the limits of the eu stability pact .
the eu 's stability and growth pact stipulates that states ' deficits may not exceed three percent of gross domestic product , and member countries must aim for broadly balanced budgets .
as germany came dangerously close to breaching the stability pact ’ s 3 percent deficit ceiling , it narrowly escaped a formal warning from brussels - a move that would have proved embarrassing for germany .
despite the close shave in february , critical voices were being raised about germany 's poor growth rate and its effects .
eckhardt wohlers , economic expert from the hamburg world economic archives , hwwa , said , " with this growth rate , germany is at the lower end of the european league .
such a growth rate will not be enough to improve the situation on the job market .
the number of those out of work will increase this year and the yearly average will climb to almost four million . "
fears that euro could trigger price rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oversized 100 euro banknote along with rising unemployment , the german public began to find fault with the new currency , the euro .
millions of consumers in germany had been complaining about price rises since the beginning of the year .
they suspected that retailers had used the changeover from marks to euro to make hefty price increases .
the euro quickly gained the reputation of being an inflation-maker .
the pessimistic mood among consumers had its effect on retail markets .
the spokesman for the retailer traders ' association , hermann franzen once again reduced the forecast turnover levels , in a sector which has been suffering for years .
" consumers are pessimistic , fearful and despondent .
they are seriously worried about their future and , unfortunately , they are daily confirmed in their convictions by negative reports .
necessities are being purchased , but no extras , no luxuries or fun items , " franzen said .
unemployment scandal sets alarm bells ringing in addition to euro worries , a scandal involving the procedures of the federal labor office broke out in march , further undermining the public ’ s confidence .
it was discovered that the local bureaus of the labor office had been dramatically inflating job-placement statistics , by as much as 70 percent ; they had found jobs for far fewer people than they claimed .
the labor office scandal forced the government to taken swift action .
in a first step it was decided to use more of the office 's workforce for finding employment for job-seekers .
the federal employment office also received a new man at the helm , social democrat florian gerster .
in addition a commission led by peter hartz , a member of the board of volkswagen , was set up to propose widespread reforms of the federal employment office and the job market .
the aim of the hartz commission was ambitious : within three years the number of unemployed in germany was to be halved from the current four million to two million people the former federal employment minister , walter riester , was clear that the government was anxious for good results . " you see , the legislature is proceeding as quickly as possible , and the fact that we have asked the commission to come up with a solution by the august 15 or 16 , is pointing in the same direction .
we have a great interest in coming to good solutions quickly and translating them quickly and well into policy , " he said .
it 's the economy stupid !
germany ’ s poor economy also paid a central role in the election campaign which picked up in august for the elections scheduled on september 22 .
the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its smaller bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- raced past chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats in opinion polls with their emphasis on the economy .
as the economic mood in germany worsened , opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber had an easy task , portraying the chancellors ’ s " politics with a steady hand " as simply doing nothing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber said a change of mood among the middleclasses was needed , as well as a new political framework for economic growth .
" the middle classes are deeply disappointed with this government and the whole depressing climate is , so to speak , raining on the whole population .
a change of government will without doubt mean a psychological boost . "
floods a blessing in disguise for schröder a change of government seemed almost certain in germany .
but things turned out quite differently with the onslaught of heavy floods in the middle of august , which inundated large parts of eastern germany and wreaked its economy .
amidst this national disaster , chancellor schröder was able to confirm his reputation as a driving force as he proclaimed his solidarity with the flood victims and freed up huge sums of money in rapid aid .
in order to pay for the damages worth billions caused by the flood disaster , the tax reform with its planned reductions for individuals and businesses , which was due to come into effect in 2003 , was postponed for a year .
an extraordinary situation demanded extraordinary measures , schröder said at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder " we have decided , to postpone by a year , the tax reductions due to come into force in 2003 .

with an overall state deficit of 2.7 per cent , financial planning at the beginning of the year foresaw germany keeping within the limits of the eu stability pact .
the eu 's stability and growth pact stipulates that states ' deficits may not exceed three percent of gross domestic product , and member countries must aim for broadly balanced budgets .
as germany came dangerously close to breaching the stability pact ’ s 3 percent deficit ceiling , it narrowly escaped a formal warning from brussels - a move that would have proved embarrassing for germany .
despite the close shave in february , critical voices were being raised about germany 's poor growth rate and its effects .
eckhardt wohlers , economic expert from the hamburg world economic archives , hwwa , said , " with this growth rate , germany is at the lower end of the european league .
such a growth rate will not be enough to improve the situation on the job market .
the number of those out of work will increase this year and the yearly average will climb to almost four million . "
fears that euro could trigger price rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oversized 100 euro banknote along with rising unemployment , the german public began to find fault with the new currency , the euro .
millions of consumers in germany had been complaining about price rises since the beginning of the year .
they suspected that retailers had used the changeover from marks to euro to make hefty price increases .
the euro quickly gained the reputation of being an inflation-maker .
the pessimistic mood among consumers had its effect on retail markets .
the spokesman for the retailer traders ' association , hermann franzen once again reduced the forecast turnover levels , in a sector which has been suffering for years .
" consumers are pessimistic , fearful and despondent .
they are seriously worried about their future and , unfortunately , they are daily confirmed in their convictions by negative reports .
necessities are being purchased , but no extras , no luxuries or fun items , " franzen said .
unemployment scandal sets alarm bells ringing in addition to euro worries , a scandal involving the procedures of the federal labor office broke out in march , further undermining the public ’ s confidence .
it was discovered that the local bureaus of the labor office had been dramatically inflating job-placement statistics , by as much as 70 percent ; they had found jobs for far fewer people than they claimed .
the labor office scandal forced the government to taken swift action .
in a first step it was decided to use more of the office 's workforce for finding employment for job-seekers .
the federal employment office also received a new man at the helm , social democrat florian gerster .
in addition a commission led by peter hartz , a member of the board of volkswagen , was set up to propose widespread reforms of the federal employment office and the job market .
the aim of the hartz commission was ambitious : within three years the number of unemployed in germany was to be halved from the current four million to two million people the former federal employment minister , walter riester , was clear that the government was anxious for good results . " you see , the legislature is proceeding as quickly as possible , and the fact that we have asked the commission to come up with a solution by the august 15 or 16 , is pointing in the same direction .
we have a great interest in coming to good solutions quickly and translating them quickly and well into policy , " he said .
it 's the economy stupid !
germany ’ s poor economy also paid a central role in the election campaign which picked up in august for the elections scheduled on september 22 .
the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its smaller bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- raced past chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats in opinion polls with their emphasis on the economy .
as the economic mood in germany worsened , opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber had an easy task , portraying the chancellors ’ s " politics with a steady hand " as simply doing nothing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber said a change of mood among the middleclasses was needed , as well as a new political framework for economic growth .
" the middle classes are deeply disappointed with this government and the whole depressing climate is , so to speak , raining on the whole population .
a change of government will without doubt mean a psychological boost . "
floods a blessing in disguise for schröder a change of government seemed almost certain in germany .
but things turned out quite differently with the onslaught of heavy floods in the middle of august , which inundated large parts of eastern germany and wreaked its economy .
amidst this national disaster , chancellor schröder was able to confirm his reputation as a driving force as he proclaimed his solidarity with the flood victims and freed up huge sums of money in rapid aid .
in order to pay for the damages worth billions caused by the flood disaster , the tax reform with its planned reductions for individuals and businesses , which was due to come into effect in 2003 , was postponed for a year .
an extraordinary situation demanded extraordinary measures , schröder said at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder " we have decided , to postpone by a year , the tax reductions due to come into force in 2003 .
this will make 6.9 billion euro available .
of this a little more than three billion euro will come from the federal sources , 2.8 billion from the regions , and a billion from local authorities , " he said in a speech .
schröder ’ s handling of the floods gained him a lot of sympathy from voters in eastern germany .
the electorate also rewarded schröder for the fact that he had no intention of getting involved in a war against iraq .
schröder 's social democrats together with their junior coalition partner , the greens managed a narrow election victory .
government in for rude shock but trouble was in store for the newly reelected government as the true state of the country ’ s dire financial state came to light .
coalition talks with the greens in mid-october revealed that germany needed to borrow more than planned , and taxes for companies and private individuals would rise .
the tightrope walk between borrowing and saving , agreed between the social democrats and the greens , came up against virulent protests from the opposition and from employers ' associations .
the leader of the csu , edmund stoiber said that millions of people felt they had been cheated by a government that was blatantly reneging on its electoral promises .
the cdu leader , angela merkel , came to a similar conclusion .
" the new rules for the environment tax , alone , lead to a further weakening of germany as a location for investment , and like a red thread running through the coalition agreement are the missing power , the missing courage , to truly renew germany , to cut through the knots and set the signals for growth and employment , " she said .
inevitable tax hikes amongt other things , the government intends to limit the opportunity for businesses to offset past losses against later profits .
economic expert herbert hax , a member of the economic ministry 's scientific advisory committee , said that the abolition of this ' loss carried forward ' means that a part of the latest tax reform will be withdrawn .
' it is not a tax reduction , just normal taxation according to ability to pay .
if that is now limited , it will be a considerable extra burden on business . '
the contributions to pension insurance are also set to rise – from 19.1 to 19.5 per cent of wages .
the president of the munich ifo institute hans-werner sinn said it would be damaging to employment .
" businesses already have great incentives to lay people off , because they are too expensive .
and this just adds to that , " he said .
" it could n't be worse " ' it could n't be worse ' - that was the conclusion of the economic survey carried out in the autum by the german chamber for industry and commerce , dihk , amongst 25,000 businesses from across the country .

dw-radio looks back . looking back over the year 2002 you can only shake your head in disbelief at the optimism emanating from the german government at the beginning of the year .
indeed in january the government believed germany had reached an economic turning point and was heading for a new upturn .

he was , however , realistic enough to predict that economic weakness would continue to have an effect on employment .

dw-radio looks back . looking back over the year 2002 you can only shake your head in disbelief at the optimism emanating from the german government at the beginning of the year .
indeed in january the government believed germany had reached an economic turning point and was heading for a new upturn .
speaking in berlin at the end of january , german finance minister , hans eichel , declared that the economy would stay weak for a while , but would pick up strongly by the middle of the year at the latest .
he was , however , realistic enough to predict that economic weakness would continue to have an effect on employment .
' the average for unemployment over the year should be just under four million and the unemployment rate , at 9.5 per cent , about the same level as last year .
this is certainly not satisfactory but i would like to remind you that in january 1998 there were around 4.8 million jobless , that 's over 500,000 more . '
budget deficit headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- aimed to reduce debt by 2005 and , in 2006 - for the first time in decades - be able to present a balanced budget .
with an overall state deficit of 2.7 per cent , financial planning at the beginning of the year foresaw germany keeping within the limits of the eu stability pact .
the eu 's stability and growth pact stipulates that states ' deficits may not exceed three percent of gross domestic product , and member countries must aim for broadly balanced budgets .
as germany came dangerously close to breaching the stability pact ’ s 3 percent deficit ceiling , it narrowly escaped a formal warning from brussels - a move that would have proved embarrassing for germany .
despite the close shave in february , critical voices were being raised about germany 's poor growth rate and its effects .
eckhardt wohlers , economic expert from the hamburg world economic archives , hwwa , said , " with this growth rate , germany is at the lower end of the european league .
such a growth rate will not be enough to improve the situation on the job market .
the number of those out of work will increase this year and the yearly average will climb to almost four million . "

millions of consumers in germany had been complaining about price rises since the beginning of the year .

the euro quickly gained the reputation of being an inflation-maker .
the pessimistic mood among consumers had its effect on retail markets .
the spokesman for the retailer traders ' association , hermann franzen once again reduced the forecast turnover levels , in a sector which has been suffering for years .
" consumers are pessimistic , fearful and despondent .
they are seriously worried about their future and , unfortunately , they are daily confirmed in their convictions by negative reports .
necessities are being purchased , but no extras , no luxuries or fun items , " franzen said .
unemployment scandal sets alarm bells ringing in addition to euro worries , a scandal involving the procedures of the federal labor office broke out in march , further undermining the public ’ s confidence .
it was discovered that the local bureaus of the labor office had been dramatically inflating job-placement statistics , by as much as 70 percent ; they had found jobs for far fewer people than they claimed .
the labor office scandal forced the government to taken swift action .
in a first step it was decided to use more of the office 's workforce for finding employment for job-seekers .
the federal employment office also received a new man at the helm , social democrat florian gerster .
in addition a commission led by peter hartz , a member of the board of volkswagen , was set up to propose widespread reforms of the federal employment office and the job market .
the aim of the hartz commission was ambitious : within three years the number of unemployed in germany was to be halved from the current four million to two million people the former federal employment minister , walter riester , was clear that the government was anxious for good results . " you see , the legislature is proceeding as quickly as possible , and the fact that we have asked the commission to come up with a solution by the august 15 or 16 , is pointing in the same direction .
we have a great interest in coming to good solutions quickly and translating them quickly and well into policy , " he said .
it 's the economy stupid !
germany ’ s poor economy also paid a central role in the election campaign which picked up in august for the elections scheduled on september 22 .
the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its smaller bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- raced past chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats in opinion polls with their emphasis on the economy .
as the economic mood in germany worsened , opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber had an easy task , portraying the chancellors ’ s " politics with a steady hand " as simply doing nothing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber said a change of mood among the middleclasses was needed , as well as a new political framework for economic growth .
" the middle classes are deeply disappointed with this government and the whole depressing climate is , so to speak , raining on the whole population .
a change of government will without doubt mean a psychological boost . "
floods a blessing in disguise for schröder a change of government seemed almost certain in germany .
but things turned out quite differently with the onslaught of heavy floods in the middle of august , which inundated large parts of eastern germany and wreaked its economy .
amidst this national disaster , chancellor schröder was able to confirm his reputation as a driving force as he proclaimed his solidarity with the flood victims and freed up huge sums of money in rapid aid .
in order to pay for the damages worth billions caused by the flood disaster , the tax reform with its planned reductions for individuals and businesses , which was due to come into effect in 2003 , was postponed for a year .
an extraordinary situation demanded extraordinary measures , schröder said at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder " we have decided , to postpone by a year , the tax reductions due to come into force in 2003 .
this will make 6.9 billion euro available .
of this a little more than three billion euro will come from the federal sources , 2.8 billion from the regions , and a billion from local authorities , " he said in a speech .
schröder ’ s handling of the floods gained him a lot of sympathy from voters in eastern germany .
the electorate also rewarded schröder for the fact that he had no intention of getting involved in a war against iraq .
schröder 's social democrats together with their junior coalition partner , the greens managed a narrow election victory .
government in for rude shock but trouble was in store for the newly reelected government as the true state of the country ’ s dire financial state came to light .
coalition talks with the greens in mid-october revealed that germany needed to borrow more than planned , and taxes for companies and private individuals would rise .
the tightrope walk between borrowing and saving , agreed between the social democrats and the greens , came up against virulent protests from the opposition and from employers ' associations .
the leader of the csu , edmund stoiber said that millions of people felt they had been cheated by a government that was blatantly reneging on its electoral promises .
the cdu leader , angela merkel , came to a similar conclusion .
" the new rules for the environment tax , alone , lead to a further weakening of germany as a location for investment , and like a red thread running through the coalition agreement are the missing power , the missing courage , to truly renew germany , to cut through the knots and set the signals for growth and employment , " she said .
inevitable tax hikes amongt other things , the government intends to limit the opportunity for businesses to offset past losses against later profits .
economic expert herbert hax , a member of the economic ministry 's scientific advisory committee , said that the abolition of this ' loss carried forward ' means that a part of the latest tax reform will be withdrawn .
' it is not a tax reduction , just normal taxation according to ability to pay .
if that is now limited , it will be a considerable extra burden on business . '
the contributions to pension insurance are also set to rise – from 19.1 to 19.5 per cent of wages .
the president of the munich ifo institute hans-werner sinn said it would be damaging to employment .
" businesses already have great incentives to lay people off , because they are too expensive .
and this just adds to that , " he said .
" it could n't be worse " ' it could n't be worse ' - that was the conclusion of the economic survey carried out in the autum by the german chamber for industry and commerce , dihk , amongst 25,000 businesses from across the country .
the mood is at a low ebb , according to the general manager of the dihk , martin wansleben .
' we did n't expect it to get that bad .
it caused a certain bewilderment and for a short while a certain helplessness as well .
what has now been agreed by the coalition is economically crazy and aimed short-sightedly at the year 2003 .
germany will lose potential for growth , if that is all that the government has offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . '

dw-radio looks back . looking back over the year 2002 you can only shake your head in disbelief at the optimism emanating from the german government at the beginning of the year .
indeed in january the government believed germany had reached an economic turning point and was heading for a new upturn .
speaking in berlin at the end of january , german finance minister , hans eichel , declared that the economy would stay weak for a while , but would pick up strongly by the middle of the year at the latest .
he was , however , realistic enough to predict that economic weakness would continue to have an effect on employment .
' the average for unemployment over the year should be just under four million and the unemployment rate , at 9.5 per cent , about the same level as last year .
this is certainly not satisfactory but i would like to remind you that in january 1998 there were around 4.8 million jobless , that 's over 500,000 more . '
budget deficit headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- aimed to reduce debt by 2005 and , in 2006 - for the first time in decades - be able to present a balanced budget .
with an overall state deficit of 2.7 per cent , financial planning at the beginning of the year foresaw germany keeping within the limits of the eu stability pact .
the eu 's stability and growth pact stipulates that states ' deficits may not exceed three percent of gross domestic product , and member countries must aim for broadly balanced budgets .
as germany came dangerously close to breaching the stability pact ’ s 3 percent deficit ceiling , it narrowly escaped a formal warning from brussels - a move that would have proved embarrassing for germany .
despite the close shave in february , critical voices were being raised about germany 's poor growth rate and its effects .
eckhardt wohlers , economic expert from the hamburg world economic archives , hwwa , said , " with this growth rate , germany is at the lower end of the european league .
such a growth rate will not be enough to improve the situation on the job market .
the number of those out of work will increase this year and the yearly average will climb to almost four million . "
fears that euro could trigger price rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oversized 100 euro banknote along with rising unemployment , the german public began to find fault with the new currency , the euro .
millions of consumers in germany had been complaining about price rises since the beginning of the year .
they suspected that retailers had used the changeover from marks to euro to make hefty price increases .
the euro quickly gained the reputation of being an inflation-maker .
the pessimistic mood among consumers had its effect on retail markets .
the spokesman for the retailer traders ' association , hermann franzen once again reduced the forecast turnover levels , in a sector which has been suffering for years .
" consumers are pessimistic , fearful and despondent .
they are seriously worried about their future and , unfortunately , they are daily confirmed in their convictions by negative reports .
necessities are being purchased , but no extras , no luxuries or fun items , " franzen said .
unemployment scandal sets alarm bells ringing in addition to euro worries , a scandal involving the procedures of the federal labor office broke out in march , further undermining the public ’ s confidence .
it was discovered that the local bureaus of the labor office had been dramatically inflating job-placement statistics , by as much as 70 percent ; they had found jobs for far fewer people than they claimed .
the labor office scandal forced the government to taken swift action .
in a first step it was decided to use more of the office 's workforce for finding employment for job-seekers .
the federal employment office also received a new man at the helm , social democrat florian gerster .
in addition a commission led by peter hartz , a member of the board of volkswagen , was set up to propose widespread reforms of the federal employment office and the job market .
the aim of the hartz commission was ambitious : within three years the number of unemployed in germany was to be halved from the current four million to two million people the former federal employment minister , walter riester , was clear that the government was anxious for good results . " you see , the legislature is proceeding as quickly as possible , and the fact that we have asked the commission to come up with a solution by the august 15 or 16 , is pointing in the same direction .
we have a great interest in coming to good solutions quickly and translating them quickly and well into policy , " he said .

dw-radio looks back . looking back over the year 2002 you can only shake your head in disbelief at the optimism emanating from the german government at the beginning of the year .
indeed in january the government believed germany had reached an economic turning point and was heading for a new upturn .
speaking in berlin at the end of january , german finance minister , hans eichel , declared that the economy would stay weak for a while , but would pick up strongly by the middle of the year at the latest .
he was , however , realistic enough to predict that economic weakness would continue to have an effect on employment .
' the average for unemployment over the year should be just under four million and the unemployment rate , at 9.5 per cent , about the same level as last year .
this is certainly not satisfactory but i would like to remind you that in january 1998 there were around 4.8 million jobless , that 's over 500,000 more . '
budget deficit headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- aimed to reduce debt by 2005 and , in 2006 - for the first time in decades - be able to present a balanced budget .
with an overall state deficit of 2.7 per cent , financial planning at the beginning of the year foresaw germany keeping within the limits of the eu stability pact .
the eu 's stability and growth pact stipulates that states ' deficits may not exceed three percent of gross domestic product , and member countries must aim for broadly balanced budgets .
as germany came dangerously close to breaching the stability pact ’ s 3 percent deficit ceiling , it narrowly escaped a formal warning from brussels - a move that would have proved embarrassing for germany .
despite the close shave in february , critical voices were being raised about germany 's poor growth rate and its effects .
eckhardt wohlers , economic expert from the hamburg world economic archives , hwwa , said , " with this growth rate , germany is at the lower end of the european league .
such a growth rate will not be enough to improve the situation on the job market .
the number of those out of work will increase this year and the yearly average will climb to almost four million . "
fears that euro could trigger price rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oversized 100 euro banknote along with rising unemployment , the german public began to find fault with the new currency , the euro .
millions of consumers in germany had been complaining about price rises since the beginning of the year .

the euro quickly gained the reputation of being an inflation-maker .
the pessimistic mood among consumers had its effect on retail markets .
the spokesman for the retailer traders ' association , hermann franzen once again reduced the forecast turnover levels , in a sector which has been suffering for years .
" consumers are pessimistic , fearful and despondent .

necessities are being purchased , but no extras , no luxuries or fun items , " franzen said .
unemployment scandal sets alarm bells ringing in addition to euro worries , a scandal involving the procedures of the federal labor office broke out in march , further undermining the public ’ s confidence .
it was discovered that the local bureaus of the labor office had been dramatically inflating job-placement statistics , by as much as 70 percent ; they had found jobs for far fewer people than they claimed .
the labor office scandal forced the government to taken swift action .
in a first step it was decided to use more of the office 's workforce for finding employment for job-seekers .
the federal employment office also received a new man at the helm , social democrat florian gerster .
in addition a commission led by peter hartz , a member of the board of volkswagen , was set up to propose widespread reforms of the federal employment office and the job market .
the aim of the hartz commission was ambitious : within three years the number of unemployed in germany was to be halved from the current four million to two million people the former federal employment minister , walter riester , was clear that the government was anxious for good results .

it 's the economy stupid !
germany ’ s poor economy also paid a central role in the election campaign which picked up in august for the elections scheduled on september 22 .
the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its smaller bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- raced past chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats in opinion polls with their emphasis on the economy .
as the economic mood in germany worsened , opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber had an easy task , portraying the chancellors ’ s " politics with a steady hand " as simply doing nothing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber said a change of mood among the middleclasses was needed , as well as a new political framework for economic growth .
" the middle classes are deeply disappointed with this government and the whole depressing climate is , so to speak , raining on the whole population .
a change of government will without doubt mean a psychological boost . "
floods a blessing in disguise for schröder a change of government seemed almost certain in germany .
but things turned out quite differently with the onslaught of heavy floods in the middle of august , which inundated large parts of eastern germany and wreaked its economy .
amidst this national disaster , chancellor schröder was able to confirm his reputation as a driving force as he proclaimed his solidarity with the flood victims and freed up huge sums of money in rapid aid .
in order to pay for the damages worth billions caused by the flood disaster , the tax reform with its planned reductions for individuals and businesses , which was due to come into effect in 2003 , was postponed for a year .
an extraordinary situation demanded extraordinary measures , schröder said at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder " we have decided , to postpone by a year , the tax reductions due to come into force in 2003 .

schröder 's social democrats together with their junior coalition partner , the greens managed a narrow election victory .
government in for rude shock but trouble was in store for the newly reelected government as the true state of the country ’ s dire financial state came to light .
coalition talks with the greens in mid-october revealed that germany needed to borrow more than planned , and taxes for companies and private individuals would rise .
the tightrope walk between borrowing and saving , agreed between the social democrats and the greens , came up against virulent protests from the opposition and from employers ' associations .
the leader of the csu , edmund stoiber said that millions of people felt they had been cheated by a government that was blatantly reneging on its electoral promises .
the cdu leader , angela merkel , came to a similar conclusion .
" the new rules for the environment tax , alone , lead to a further weakening of germany as a location for investment , and like a red thread running through the coalition agreement are the missing power , the missing courage , to truly renew germany , to cut through the knots and set the signals for growth and employment , " she said .
inevitable tax hikes amongt other things , the government intends to limit the opportunity for businesses to offset past losses against later profits .
economic expert herbert hax , a member of the economic ministry 's scientific advisory committee , said that the abolition of this ' loss carried forward ' means that a part of the latest tax reform will be withdrawn .
' it is not a tax reduction , just normal taxation according to ability to pay .
if that is now limited , it will be a considerable extra burden on business . '
the contributions to pension insurance are also set to rise – from 19.1 to 19.5 per cent of wages .
the president of the munich ifo institute hans-werner sinn said it would be damaging to employment .
" businesses already have great incentives to lay people off , because they are too expensive .
and this just adds to that , " he said .
" it could n't be worse " ' it could n't be worse ' - that was the conclusion of the economic survey carried out in the autum by the german chamber for industry and commerce , dihk , amongst 25,000 businesses from across the country .

dw-radio looks back . looking back over the year 2002 you can only shake your head in disbelief at the optimism emanating from the german government at the beginning of the year .
indeed in january the government believed germany had reached an economic turning point and was heading for a new upturn .
speaking in berlin at the end of january , german finance minister , hans eichel , declared that the economy would stay weak for a while , but would pick up strongly by the middle of the year at the latest .
he was , however , realistic enough to predict that economic weakness would continue to have an effect on employment .
' the average for unemployment over the year should be just under four million and the unemployment rate , at 9.5 per cent , about the same level as last year .
this is certainly not satisfactory but i would like to remind you that in january 1998 there were around 4.8 million jobless , that 's over 500,000 more . '
budget deficit headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- aimed to reduce debt by 2005 and , in 2006 - for the first time in decades - be able to present a balanced budget .
with an overall state deficit of 2.7 per cent , financial planning at the beginning of the year foresaw germany keeping within the limits of the eu stability pact .
the eu 's stability and growth pact stipulates that states ' deficits may not exceed three percent of gross domestic product , and member countries must aim for broadly balanced budgets .
as germany came dangerously close to breaching the stability pact ’ s 3 percent deficit ceiling , it narrowly escaped a formal warning from brussels - a move that would have proved embarrassing for germany .
despite the close shave in february , critical voices were being raised about germany 's poor growth rate and its effects .
eckhardt wohlers , economic expert from the hamburg world economic archives , hwwa , said , " with this growth rate , germany is at the lower end of the european league .
such a growth rate will not be enough to improve the situation on the job market .
the number of those out of work will increase this year and the yearly average will climb to almost four million . "
fears that euro could trigger price rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oversized 100 euro banknote along with rising unemployment , the german public began to find fault with the new currency , the euro .
millions of consumers in germany had been complaining about price rises since the beginning of the year .
they suspected that retailers had used the changeover from marks to euro to make hefty price increases .
the euro quickly gained the reputation of being an inflation-maker .
the pessimistic mood among consumers had its effect on retail markets .
the spokesman for the retailer traders ' association , hermann franzen once again reduced the forecast turnover levels , in a sector which has been suffering for years .
" consumers are pessimistic , fearful and despondent .
they are seriously worried about their future and , unfortunately , they are daily confirmed in their convictions by negative reports .
necessities are being purchased , but no extras , no luxuries or fun items , " franzen said .
unemployment scandal sets alarm bells ringing in addition to euro worries , a scandal involving the procedures of the federal labor office broke out in march , further undermining the public ’ s confidence .
it was discovered that the local bureaus of the labor office had been dramatically inflating job-placement statistics , by as much as 70 percent ; they had found jobs for far fewer people than they claimed .
the labor office scandal forced the government to taken swift action .
in a first step it was decided to use more of the office 's workforce for finding employment for job-seekers .
the federal employment office also received a new man at the helm , social democrat florian gerster .
in addition a commission led by peter hartz , a member of the board of volkswagen , was set up to propose widespread reforms of the federal employment office and the job market .
the aim of the hartz commission was ambitious : within three years the number of unemployed in germany was to be halved from the current four million to two million people the former federal employment minister , walter riester , was clear that the government was anxious for good results . " you see , the legislature is proceeding as quickly as possible , and the fact that we have asked the commission to come up with a solution by the august 15 or 16 , is pointing in the same direction .
we have a great interest in coming to good solutions quickly and translating them quickly and well into policy , " he said .
it 's the economy stupid !
germany ’ s poor economy also paid a central role in the election campaign which picked up in august for the elections scheduled on september 22 .
the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its smaller bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- raced past chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats in opinion polls with their emphasis on the economy .
as the economic mood in germany worsened , opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber had an easy task , portraying the chancellors ’ s " politics with a steady hand " as simply doing nothing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber said a change of mood among the middleclasses was needed , as well as a new political framework for economic growth .
" the middle classes are deeply disappointed with this government and the whole depressing climate is , so to speak , raining on the whole population .
a change of government will without doubt mean a psychological boost . "
floods a blessing in disguise for schröder a change of government seemed almost certain in germany .
but things turned out quite differently with the onslaught of heavy floods in the middle of august , which inundated large parts of eastern germany and wreaked its economy .
amidst this national disaster , chancellor schröder was able to confirm his reputation as a driving force as he proclaimed his solidarity with the flood victims and freed up huge sums of money in rapid aid .
in order to pay for the damages worth billions caused by the flood disaster , the tax reform with its planned reductions for individuals and businesses , which was due to come into effect in 2003 , was postponed for a year .
an extraordinary situation demanded extraordinary measures , schröder said at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder " we have decided , to postpone by a year , the tax reductions due to come into force in 2003 .
this will make 6.9 billion euro available .
of this a little more than three billion euro will come from the federal sources , 2.8 billion from the regions , and a billion from local authorities , " he said in a speech .
schröder ’ s handling of the floods gained him a lot of sympathy from voters in eastern germany .
the electorate also rewarded schröder for the fact that he had no intention of getting involved in a war against iraq .
schröder 's social democrats together with their junior coalition partner , the greens managed a narrow election victory .
government in for rude shock but trouble was in store for the newly reelected government as the true state of the country ’ s dire financial state came to light .
coalition talks with the greens in mid-october revealed that germany needed to borrow more than planned , and taxes for companies and private individuals would rise .

the contributions to pension insurance are also set to rise – from 19.1 to 19.5 per cent of wages .

eckhardt wohlers , economic expert from the hamburg world economic archives , hwwa , said , " with this growth rate , germany is at the lower end of the european league .
such a growth rate will not be enough to improve the situation on the job market .
the number of those out of work will increase this year and the yearly average will climb to almost four million . "
fears that euro could trigger price rises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oversized 100 euro banknote along with rising unemployment , the german public began to find fault with the new currency , the euro .
millions of consumers in germany had been complaining about price rises since the beginning of the year .
they suspected that retailers had used the changeover from marks to euro to make hefty price increases .
the euro quickly gained the reputation of being an inflation-maker .
the pessimistic mood among consumers had its effect on retail markets .
the spokesman for the retailer traders ' association , hermann franzen once again reduced the forecast turnover levels , in a sector which has been suffering for years .
" consumers are pessimistic , fearful and despondent .
they are seriously worried about their future and , unfortunately , they are daily confirmed in their convictions by negative reports .
necessities are being purchased , but no extras , no luxuries or fun items , " franzen said .
unemployment scandal sets alarm bells ringing in addition to euro worries , a scandal involving the procedures of the federal labor office broke out in march , further undermining the public ’ s confidence .
it was discovered that the local bureaus of the labor office had been dramatically inflating job-placement statistics , by as much as 70 percent ; they had found jobs for far fewer people than they claimed .
the labor office scandal forced the government to taken swift action .
in a first step it was decided to use more of the office 's workforce for finding employment for job-seekers .
the federal employment office also received a new man at the helm , social democrat florian gerster .
in addition a commission led by peter hartz , a member of the board of volkswagen , was set up to propose widespread reforms of the federal employment office and the job market .
the aim of the hartz commission was ambitious : within three years the number of unemployed in germany was to be halved from the current four million to two million people the former federal employment minister , walter riester , was clear that the government was anxious for good results . " you see , the legislature is proceeding as quickly as possible , and the fact that we have asked the commission to come up with a solution by the august 15 or 16 , is pointing in the same direction .
we have a great interest in coming to good solutions quickly and translating them quickly and well into policy , " he said .
it 's the economy stupid !
germany ’ s poor economy also paid a central role in the election campaign which picked up in august for the elections scheduled on september 22 .
the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its smaller bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- raced past chancellor schröder ’ s social democrats in opinion polls with their emphasis on the economy .
as the economic mood in germany worsened , opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber had an easy task , portraying the chancellors ’ s " politics with a steady hand " as simply doing nothing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber stoiber said a change of mood among the middleclasses was needed , as well as a new political framework for economic growth .
" the middle classes are deeply disappointed with this government and the whole depressing climate is , so to speak , raining on the whole population .
a change of government will without doubt mean a psychological boost . "
floods a blessing in disguise for schröder a change of government seemed almost certain in germany .
but things turned out quite differently with the onslaught of heavy floods in the middle of august , which inundated large parts of eastern germany and wreaked its economy .
amidst this national disaster , chancellor schröder was able to confirm his reputation as a driving force as he proclaimed his solidarity with the flood victims and freed up huge sums of money in rapid aid .
in order to pay for the damages worth billions caused by the flood disaster , the tax reform with its planned reductions for individuals and businesses , which was due to come into effect in 2003 , was postponed for a year .
an extraordinary situation demanded extraordinary measures , schröder said at the time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder " we have decided , to postpone by a year , the tax reductions due to come into force in 2003 .
this will make 6.9 billion euro available .
of this a little more than three billion euro will come from the federal sources , 2.8 billion from the regions , and a billion from local authorities , " he said in a speech .
schröder ’ s handling of the floods gained him a lot of sympathy from voters in eastern germany .
the electorate also rewarded schröder for the fact that he had no intention of getting involved in a war against iraq .
schröder 's social democrats together with their junior coalition partner , the greens managed a narrow election victory .
government in for rude shock but trouble was in store for the newly reelected government as the true state of the country ’ s dire financial state came to light .
coalition talks with the greens in mid-october revealed that germany needed to borrow more than planned , and taxes for companies and private individuals would rise .
the tightrope walk between borrowing and saving , agreed between the social democrats and the greens , came up against virulent protests from the opposition and from employers ' associations .
the leader of the csu , edmund stoiber said that millions of people felt they had been cheated by a government that was blatantly reneging on its electoral promises .
the cdu leader , angela merkel , came to a similar conclusion .
" the new rules for the environment tax , alone , lead to a further weakening of germany as a location for investment , and like a red thread running through the coalition agreement are the missing power , the missing courage , to truly renew germany , to cut through the knots and set the signals for growth and employment , " she said .
inevitable tax hikes amongt other things , the government intends to limit the opportunity for businesses to offset past losses against later profits .
economic expert herbert hax , a member of the economic ministry 's scientific advisory committee , said that the abolition of this ' loss carried forward ' means that a part of the latest tax reform will be withdrawn .
' it is not a tax reduction , just normal taxation according to ability to pay .
if that is now limited , it will be a considerable extra burden on business . '
the contributions to pension insurance are also set to rise – from 19.1 to 19.5 per cent of wages .
the president of the munich ifo institute hans-werner sinn said it would be damaging to employment .
" businesses already have great incentives to lay people off , because they are too expensive .
and this just adds to that , " he said .
" it could n't be worse " ' it could n't be worse ' - that was the conclusion of the economic survey carried out in the autum by the german chamber for industry and commerce , dihk , amongst 25,000 businesses from across the country .
the mood is at a low ebb , according to the general manager of the dihk , martin wansleben .
' we did n't expect it to get that bad .
it caused a certain bewilderment and for a short while a certain helplessness as well .
what has now been agreed by the coalition is economically crazy and aimed short-sightedly at the year 2003 .
germany will lose potential for growth , if that is all that the government has offer in the way of signals for more employment and more growth . '
black wednesday for government but there was worse ahead for finance minister hans eichel .
in what is now known as " black wednesday " , november 13 brought a torrent of bad economic news .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
given this bleak economic data , it 's hard to find any remains of the optimism with which the government began the year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de black week for german chancellor the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .

dw-radio looks back . looking back over the year 2002 you can only shake your head in disbelief at the optimism emanating from the german government at the beginning of the year .
indeed in january the government believed germany had reached an economic turning point and was heading for a new upturn .
speaking in berlin at the end of january , german finance minister , hans eichel , declared that the economy would stay weak for a while , but would pick up strongly by the middle of the year at the latest .
he was , however , realistic enough to predict that economic weakness would continue to have an effect on employment .
' the average for unemployment over the year should be just under four million and the unemployment rate , at 9.5 per cent , about the same level as last year .
this is certainly not satisfactory but i would like to remind you that in january 1998 there were around 4.8 million jobless , that 's over 500,000 more . '
budget deficit headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans eichel eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- aimed to reduce debt by 2005 and , in 2006 - for the first time in decades - be able to present a balanced budget .
with an overall state deficit of 2.7 per cent , financial planning at the beginning of the year foresaw germany keeping within the limits of the eu stability pact .
the eu 's stability and growth pact stipulates that states ' deficits may not exceed three percent of gross domestic product , and member countries must aim for broadly balanced budgets .
as germany came dangerously close to breaching the stability pact ’ s 3 percent deficit ceiling , it narrowly escaped a formal warning from brussels - a move that would have proved embarrassing for germany .
despite the close shave in february , critical voices were being raised about germany 's poor growth rate and its effects .

it seems i have become a christmas gift from -lsb- chinese -rsb- president jiang zemin to president george bush xu wenli mr xu - one of china 's most prominent pro-democracy campaigners - spoke just hours after his arrival to the united states , following his release from a chinese jail .
he was arrested in 1998 after trying to help set up the opposition china democracy party , and was sentenced to 13 years in prison .
mr xu , 59 , suffers from hepatitis b and was granted " medical parole " following a deterioration in his health , according to us activist john kamm .
mr xu and his wife were met at chicago 's o 'hare airport by their daughter , xu jin , who teaches in america .
they later flew to new york .
defiant " it seems i have become a christmas gift from -lsb- chinese -rsb- president jiang zemin to president george bush , " mr xu told the afp news agency .
xu wenli : biography 1943 : born 1979 : participated in democracy wall protest 1982 : jailed for 12 years for " counter-revolutionary " activity 1993 : released from prison 1998 : sentenced to 13 years in jail for founding china democracy party -lrb- cdp -rrb- 2002 : freed from prison , flies to united states xu wenli : " godfather of dissent " he said he was used in what he described as the " political game " , and insisted that democratic change remained an unshakeable force in china .
" people like me in the so-called ' frontline ' are really just stepping stones .
it is the chinese people who will make the leap themselves . "
although welcoming mr xu 's release , the new york-based human rights watch welcomed said it was not enough .
" no-one should mistake his release as a sign of improvement in china 's human rights record , " said the head of the group 's asia division , brad adams .
" this was a token gesture to the bush administration , and a cynical move by beijing to head off international criticism . "
mr xu 's release comes in the wake of an official visit to china by us human rights diplomat lorne craner , who handed over a list of 298 people that washington believes are being held as political prisoners .
as part of the visit , china agreed to invite united nations experts on torture and religious freedom to visit the country in an attempt to improve its human rights reputation .
but in an unrelated move , it signalled it was still not prepared to tolerate dissent by confirming it had detained wang bingzhang , another veteran dissident now based in the us , for " spying and terrorism " .
exile mr xu was one of the founders of the china democracy party , which was set up in the hope of introducing multi-party democracy to china and challenging the communist party 's grip on power .
authorities in beijing at first appeared to tolerate the threat , before cracking down and arresting all the leaders of the new party , which was branded an " illegal organisation " .
following mr xu 's sentencing , his case has regularly been raised with chinese authorities by human rights groups and foreign governments .
the bbc 's holly williams in beijing says the terms of his release effectively mean exile .
she says mr xu will not be free to live in china or return for visits and will not be allowed to contact other members of the china democracy party , most of whom are still in prison .
