the move was heralded at talks between uk prime minister tony blair and jose maria aznar , the prime minister of spain - holder of the eu presidency - in london on monday . "
we are not advocating a fortress europe , but ... there has got to be some order and some rules brought into the system " tony blair mr aznar said the eu 's external borders had to be tightened and people-traffickers targeted .
aid could be withheld from non-eu countries that did not co-operate .
mr blair called it " one of the most pressing issues of our time " - but insisted he was not advocating a " fortress europe " .
the two men want asylum to top the agenda at next month 's european summit in seville .
a european agreement on immigration was drawn up three years ago , but in a strongly-worded letter to mr aznar his uk counterpart has complained that the eu is falling behind in implementing it .
the recent success of far-right parties has pushed the issue back into the limelight .
the spanish prime minister stressed that europe had to be " unwavering " in its battle to eliminate mafias that deal in human cargo .
organised crime speaking at a press conference in downing street , mr blair said : " we were very much in agreement with the need to try to tackle what is one of the most pressing issues of our time , which is the issue of immigration and asylum . "
he added that a major issue was " how we make sure that the external borders of europe are made more secure against the illegal trafficking of people " . "
we must be unwavering in our battle to eliminate mafias that deal in human traffic " jose maria aznar " we are not advocating a fortress europe , but what we are saying is that there has got to be some order and some rules brought into the system . "
mr blair said human trafficking was often underpinned by organised crime , " by people operating in circumstances that are totally outside the boundaries of the law " .
mr aznar said he had asked his interior minister to draw up a series of measures on asylum that could be discussed at the seville summit .
he went on : " we have to make legal immigration a positive factor of integration for our societies and we must act much more decisively and efficiently in terms of controlling the eu 's external borders .
" we must be unwavering in our battle to eliminate mafias that deal in human traffic . "
' urgent action needed ' in his letter to mr aznar , mr blair stressed that " illegal immigration and criminal trafficking in asylum seekers are preoccupying our citizens " .
the uk prime minister said it was " politically imperative that seville delivers a strong push , giving a remit for urgent action to strengthen the eu 's borders " .
however , refugee groups have expressed fears the proposals could cause problems for genuine asylum seekers .
nick hardwick , from the refugee council , asked how people fleeing persecution were supposed to get their claims legally heard .

the report - the latest edition of the annual state department reports - says 3,547 people were killed in 2001 world-wide - the overwhelming majority of them in the attacks in the us on 11 september .
the report comes just as americans are receiving new warnings that further civilian attacks are likely .
there will be another terrorist attack , we will not be able to stop it robert mueller , fbi chief the head of the fbi , robert mueller , says he believes it is inevitable that suicide bombers will eventually begin attacks in the us , as they have in israel .

senator bob graham told american news channel nbc that the country 's enemy " is not al-qaeda alone " , and mentioned several prominent groups considered by the us to be terroritst organisations - including hezbollah and islamic jihad - that had the capacity , and the desire , to attack the us .
he said he believed a number of extremists had come into the us in the last few months , hidden in container ships . '

bush is embroiled in a row over intelligence reports intelligence specialists have said there has been an increase in the volume of messages between al-qaeda cells , similar to that noted before 11 september .

one activist , rheya linden , said she hoped a management plan could be put in place to protect the kangaroos but said she was not confident of stopping the cull .
other campaigners claim the slaughter has more to do with money than animal welfare .
they say it is part of a plan to establish the commercial killing of kangaroos on the puckapunyal base .
these are allegations denied by the army , but a senior official did say its position over commercial culling could change in the future .
elsewhere in australia the trade in kangaroo meat is a multi-million dollar industry , with exports to europe and japan , where the lean meat is extremely popular .

president bush set out a list of conditions which he said had to be met by president fidel castro 's government in order for the sanctions to be eased .
you have to have a nerve to go to miami and speak of honest and clean elections ricardo alarcon , head of cuban legislature but in a cuban television programme , national assembly speaker ricardo alarcon criticised mr bush for pandering to the " terrorist mafia " in miami , as he called the vehemently anti-castro cuban exile community there .
mr alarcon also chided the us president for " having the nerve " to raise the issue of free elections in florida - where mr bush was handed victory in 2000 after one of the most controversial votes in us history .
dissidents in cuba have welcomed mr bush 's call for reform , but said both washington and havana should be prepared to be more flexible in order to begin dialogue .

" then and only then , i will work with the us congress to ease the ban on trade and travel between our two countries , " he said .
later , mr bush travelled to miami where he made a further speech telling cuban-americans that real change could come about if cubans were allowed to hold a referendum on their future .

elizardo sanchez , leader of the cuban commission on human rights and national reconciliation , said he supported all mr bush 's references to human rights and the release of political prisoners " but the rest of his address is cold war rhetoric " .
distant memory president bush 's address comes only days after former us president jimmy carter called for an end to the us embargo during a visit to cuba .
mr carter and other critics - including some members of the us congress - argue that the us restrictions have failed to end mr castro 's hold on power while making life harder for ordinary cubans .

i was a very violent and angry young man basically .
certainly overcrowding played a large part in that - because you could be locked up for 23 hours out of 24 and often 24 if the weather was inclement or they did n't have the staff to man the exercise yard .
in that kind of atmosphere its inevitable unrest will occur .
basically it means you will spend more time in your cell and the regime in terms of education workshops visits will be curtailed .
prison staff have to cope with those high numbers - tensions fray and it can lead to unrest and it can lead to riots .
we should care for a number of reasons .
of the 71 thousand people inside our prisons , all but 24 are coming back out - and they are going to live next door to people like you and me and everyone else who 's watching this programme .
my fear is that if we have a long hot summer and we have these levels inside our prisons it can so easily become unmanageable .
the combination of overcrowding and a long hot summer can lead to unrest and that 's the last thing we need or the country needs or prison service needs right now . "
on breakfast we interviewed david roddan , general-secretary of the prisoner governors ' association .
he said : " we are concerned about overcrowding , but our prison system is very different now to what we had in 1990 ... we do have 13,000 prisoners sharing cells which are designed for one ... we ca n't cope with a system that is clogged up with short term offenders .
prisons should only be for violent and serious offenders ... at the moment we are using early release on tags for short term offenders , the failure rate is very low , only 4 % ... i think we could clear our prisons of 3-4,000 prisoners on very short sentences . "

the film 's leads , leonardo dicaprio and cameron diaz , flew into the festival for the 20-minute screening , and sharon stone and juliette binoche were among the stars in the audience .
dicaprio led a standing ovation for scorsese , director of classic films such as raging bull and taxi driver , who told the audience about what he called his " biggest-ever undertaking " .
" this movie has been in my mind and in my heart since i was 10 years old and growing up in downtown new york , " said the director .
" ultimately this film asks the question ' what is america , and what does it mean to be an american ? " '
gangs of new york is set in downtown new york in the middle of the 19th century and tells the story of a young immigrant irishman , played by dicaprio , out to avenge his father 's murder .
acrimony the film 's cast includes oscar-winner jim broadbent and daniel day-lewis as a gangland boss .
the budget is reported to have run to almost $ 100m -lrb- £ 69m -rrb- and the film has run into prolonged delays amid reports of acrimony behind the scenes .
the movie was originally set to be in cinemas last december , but there have been reports of a falling out between scorsese and miramax studio boss harvey weinstein during shooting at cinecitta studios in rome .
now both have dismissed the rumours and say the film is set for release on christmas day 2002 - an important pre-oscars slot .
at a post-screening party , dicaprio was confident that the film would have an emotional impact on audiences .
" by the end of the 20 minutes i was getting chills , " he said .
" it 's like a dream come true for me , as it would be for any actor , to work in a martin scorsese epic and have people see just 20 minutes of it and yet get titillated and excited . "
earlier in the day dicaprio and diaz brought the french town 's croisette to a halt as hundreds of fans swarmed in to catch a glimpse of them .

we ca n't sit here and appear to be a party to this illegal act iceland whaling commissioner stefan asmundsson the country , which wanted to join the iwc while reserving the right to ignore the moratorium on commercial whaling , has accused the organisation of behaving illegally .
" it has gone too far , " iceland whaling commissioner stefan asmundsson said .
" we can not accept it . "
in a further blow to pro-whaling nations , japan has lost a vote to expand its coastal catch of minke whales .
bitter divisions clive myrie , the bbc correspondent at the meeting , says the whole conference has being marked by in-fighting , acrimony and bitterness .
the pro-whaling nations - led by japan and norway - have repeatedly clashed with those against a resumption of commercial killing .
the pro-whaling lobby argues that global whale stocks mean a certain amount of commercial whaling should be allowed .
but many european union countries , america and others believe stocks are too low for full whaling to resume .
pro-whaling nations cheered in support when the icelandic delegates decided to leave , claiming they were the victims of a dirty tricks campaign led by a number of anti-whaling nations .
" we ca n't sit here and appear to be a party to this illegal act , " said mr asmundsson .
he hinted that iceland might consider resuming commercial whaling without the iwc 's approval , but he said the country would review the situation and explore its options first .
anti-whaling victory monday 's decision to exclude iceland was an unexpected victory for the anti-whaling camp in the first vote to be taken at this year 's meeting of the iwc .
japan has been leading the drive for a resumption of commercial whaling , banned 15 years ago , at the meeting - which is held in the port of shimonoseki in western japan , home to the country 's whaling fleet .
the vote over iceland 's membership was seen as a key test of sentiment as the conference got under way .
pro-whaling countries had tried to overturn last year 's ruling that iceland could not join until it agreed to accept the iwc 's moratorium on commercial whaling .
pro-whaling campaigners make their case at the meeting they were defeated by 25 votes to 20 despite their optimism that this time they could muster the necessary majority .
iceland has had non-voting observer status since its delegates walked out of an iwc meeting 10 years ago to protest against the commission 's anti-whaling stance .
its return to full membership could have given the pro-whaling nations a majority .
the uk fisheries minister , elliot morley , said the result was better than expected and a very good sign , but he cautioned that anti-whaling countries could face tougher resistance on other issues .
stormy days ahead japan is also seeking to block proposals for new whale sanctuaries in the south pacific and south atlantic .
it says some species of whales are so abundant they are threatening fish stocks .
the united states has described the claim as false and an attempt to make the whale a scapegoat for over-fishing .

if ministers agree , the situation facing us millionaire steve bing - being sued for paternity after so-called " dna theft " - would be outlawed in britain .
private investigators acting for the husband of a former lover stole used dental floss from the waste bin outside mr bing 's home , and tested the dna on it .
mr bing is already locked in a separate paternity battle with the uk actress and model elizabeth hurley .
it is not known whether similar incidents have happened in the uk - although an estimated 10,000 dna paternity tests take place every year .
the paternity testing industry is currently confined only by a voluntary code of practice , which asks for the consent of both mother and father prior to testing .
' repercussions ' lady helena kennedy wants tough new laws the human genetics commission , an independent advisory body , published its report , inside information , on tuesday morning .
it calls on the government to consider making it a criminal offence to deceitfully obtain and analyse another person 's genetic information for non-medical purposes .
the commission says this sort of activity would be a gross intrusion into someone else 's privacy .
it is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous journalists secretly taking something like a coffee mug belonging to a public figure and analysing the dna obtained from it .
that could reveal whether they were at high risk for a disorder like alzheimer 's disease .
the commission also recommends that the government consider introducing legislation to prevent genetic discrimination in areas such as employment and insurance .
barrister lady helena kennedy chaired the commission .
she said that increasing numbers of people were applying to laboratories to have genetic samples tested to establish whether they had fathered a child .
lady kennedy said : " a person may say what is wrong with a man knowing whether he really is the father of a child .
" but there are very real repercussions for a family when that is done , and the best way of doing it is through the proper legal channels because it can have an enormous impact on the child 's life , and on sibling 's lives . "
' biobank ' launch the report reinforces the need to obtain consent before that data can be used for medical research .
uk scientists recently launched the " biobank " , a collection of many thousands of dna profiles .
the commission has already recommended a moratorium on the use of " adverse genetic test results " by the insurance industry .
however , the report recommends that , despite public support for the use of dna fingerprinting to solve crime , police should not have access to research databases . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's margaret gilmore " government advisors say stealing dna should be a crime " see also : 27 jul 02 -pipe- health analysis : banning secret dna tests 29 jan 99 -pipe- health gene screens pass blood test 30 aug 01 -pipe- health gene check could predict menopause 25 mar 01 -pipe- health tighter controls for paternity testing 19 apr 02 -pipe- entertainment bing launches paternity case internet links : human genetics commission biobank study department of health code of practice on paternity testing the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top health stories now : heart risk link to big families back pain drug ' may aid diabetics ' congo ebola outbreak confirmed vegetables ward off alzheimer 's polio campaign launched in iraq gene defect explains high blood pressure botox ' may cause new wrinkles ' alien ' abductees ' show real symptoms links to more health stories are at the foot of the page .

the man , known as infliction , has alleged that the education minister , martin mcguinness , fired the first shot on bloody sunday .
the saville inquiry is examining the events of 30 january 1972 when 13 civilians were shot dead by british army soldiers during a civil rights march in the city .
a 14th person died later .
the security service has expressed doubts infliction could give evidence in saftey .
the families of the victims say they will fight against any special arrangements being imposed .
security service documents say that infliction was a leading member of the provisional ira , who claimed the martin mcguinness told him that he fired the first shot from a thompson submachine gun .
the security services have expressed doubts as to whether he can be safely called to give evidence himself .
