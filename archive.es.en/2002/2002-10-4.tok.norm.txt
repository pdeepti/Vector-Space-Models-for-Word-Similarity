tensions between the united states and germany over chancellor gerhard schroeder 's firm anti-war stance on iraq eased on thursday when president bush congratulated germany on the 12th anniversary of unification . one million people , including former u.s. president bill clinton , gathered for the unveiling of the restored brandenburg gate on thursday as germany celebrated 12 years as a reunited nation .
the mood was lifted further after a pledge of friendship was received from president george bush after weeks of tension between the two countries over iraq .
while the public holiday focused attention on the lingering gaps between eastern and western germans , it also gave u.s. and german leaders an occasion to subdue their festering dispute over policy toward iraq .
bush , who pointedly ignored schroeder 's re-election two weeks ago , ended a period of chilled silence that has marred the pivotal relationship in past weeks with a warm letter to german president johannes rau , praising close german-american ties over the last 200 years .
president 's warm wishes revive ' poisoned ' relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schroeder begin the journey back to reconcilliation .
" i extend to you and the people of germany my warmest wishes on the anniversary of german unification , " wrote bush after top administration officials said last month relations had been " poisoned " by schroeder 's anti-war position .
the president 's congratulations recalled the mutual bonds built up during decades of u.s. backing for former west germany and west berlin during the cold war .
" the united states stood firmly with germany 's people in our common goal of bringing freedom to a united germany , " he said in the breakthrough letter .
" the end of communism and the fall of the berlin wall were a great success for both our nations . "
' shared democratic values deepen the bond ' says bush " the german and american people have ties that date back to the establishment of our nation .
over the past half century , those bonds were deepened by a shared commitment to democratic values " , he said .
even though germany 's centre-left government remains opposed to any " military adventures " in iraq , government officials in berlin seized on the letter from bush , seeing it as a signal that the period of frosty relations between the allies had started to thaw .
chancellor schroeder 's co-ordinator for u.s. policy , karsten voigt , said the letter was evidence that the close german-american alliance was still intact even though berlin continues to have a different position on iraq .
german diplomats said the letter from bush went far beyond the normal perfunctory congratulations .
germany receives president 's letter ethusiastically " the american expectations that germany would be a close ally are still being fulfilled and will continue to be valid , " voigt said in a statement to reuters .
" the treatment of iraq is still a problem for germany and the united states .
it 's time for the weapons inspectors to return , not threaten military strikes . "
the healing process is still in its early stages , with the iraq issue the main stumbling block .
speaking in paris late on wednesday evening after a meeting with french president jacques chirac , gerhard schroeder said he would not alter his position opposing war in iraq .
" we defined our position before the election , " schroeder said .
" after the election in germany , nothing has changed .

even though germany 's centre-left government remains opposed to any " military adventures " in iraq , government officials in berlin seized on the letter from bush , seeing it as a signal that the period of frosty relations between the allies had started to thaw .
chancellor schroeder 's co-ordinator for u.s. policy , karsten voigt , said the letter was evidence that the close german-american alliance was still intact even though berlin continues to have a different position on iraq .
german diplomats said the letter from bush went far beyond the normal perfunctory congratulations .
germany receives president 's letter ethusiastically " the american expectations that germany would be a close ally are still being fulfilled and will continue to be valid , " voigt said in a statement to reuters .

tensions between the united states and germany over chancellor gerhard schroeder 's firm anti-war stance on iraq eased on thursday when president bush congratulated germany on the 12th anniversary of unification . one million people , including former u.s. president bill clinton , gathered for the unveiling of the restored brandenburg gate on thursday as germany celebrated 12 years as a reunited nation .
the mood was lifted further after a pledge of friendship was received from president george bush after weeks of tension between the two countries over iraq .
while the public holiday focused attention on the lingering gaps between eastern and western germans , it also gave u.s. and german leaders an occasion to subdue their festering dispute over policy toward iraq .
bush , who pointedly ignored schroeder 's re-election two weeks ago , ended a period of chilled silence that has marred the pivotal relationship in past weeks with a warm letter to german president johannes rau , praising close german-american ties over the last 200 years .
president 's warm wishes revive ' poisoned ' relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schroeder begin the journey back to reconcilliation .
" i extend to you and the people of germany my warmest wishes on the anniversary of german unification , " wrote bush after top administration officials said last month relations had been " poisoned " by schroeder 's anti-war position .
the president 's congratulations recalled the mutual bonds built up during decades of u.s. backing for former west germany and west berlin during the cold war .
" the united states stood firmly with germany 's people in our common goal of bringing freedom to a united germany , " he said in the breakthrough letter .
" the end of communism and the fall of the berlin wall were a great success for both our nations . "

tensions between the united states and germany over chancellor gerhard schroeder 's firm anti-war stance on iraq eased on thursday when president bush congratulated germany on the 12th anniversary of unification . one million people , including former u.s. president bill clinton , gathered for the unveiling of the restored brandenburg gate on thursday as germany celebrated 12 years as a reunited nation .
the mood was lifted further after a pledge of friendship was received from president george bush after weeks of tension between the two countries over iraq .
while the public holiday focused attention on the lingering gaps between eastern and western germans , it also gave u.s. and german leaders an occasion to subdue their festering dispute over policy toward iraq .
bush , who pointedly ignored schroeder 's re-election two weeks ago , ended a period of chilled silence that has marred the pivotal relationship in past weeks with a warm letter to german president johannes rau , praising close german-american ties over the last 200 years .
president 's warm wishes revive ' poisoned ' relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schroeder begin the journey back to reconcilliation .
" i extend to you and the people of germany my warmest wishes on the anniversary of german unification , " wrote bush after top administration officials said last month relations had been " poisoned " by schroeder 's anti-war position .
the president 's congratulations recalled the mutual bonds built up during decades of u.s. backing for former west germany and west berlin during the cold war .
" the united states stood firmly with germany 's people in our common goal of bringing freedom to a united germany , " he said in the breakthrough letter .
" the end of communism and the fall of the berlin wall were a great success for both our nations . "
' shared democratic values deepen the bond ' says bush " the german and american people have ties that date back to the establishment of our nation .
over the past half century , those bonds were deepened by a shared commitment to democratic values " , he said .
even though germany 's centre-left government remains opposed to any " military adventures " in iraq , government officials in berlin seized on the letter from bush , seeing it as a signal that the period of frosty relations between the allies had started to thaw .
chancellor schroeder 's co-ordinator for u.s. policy , karsten voigt , said the letter was evidence that the close german-american alliance was still intact even though berlin continues to have a different position on iraq .
german diplomats said the letter from bush went far beyond the normal perfunctory congratulations .
germany receives president 's letter ethusiastically " the american expectations that germany would be a close ally are still being fulfilled and will continue to be valid , " voigt said in a statement to reuters .
" the treatment of iraq is still a problem for germany and the united states .
it 's time for the weapons inspectors to return , not threaten military strikes . "
the healing process is still in its early stages , with the iraq issue the main stumbling block .
speaking in paris late on wednesday evening after a meeting with french president jacques chirac , gerhard schroeder said he would not alter his position opposing war in iraq .
" we defined our position before the election , " schroeder said .
" after the election in germany , nothing has changed .

even though germany 's centre-left government remains opposed to any " military adventures " in iraq , government officials in berlin seized on the letter from bush , seeing it as a signal that the period of frosty relations between the allies had started to thaw .
chancellor schroeder 's co-ordinator for u.s. policy , karsten voigt , said the letter was evidence that the close german-american alliance was still intact even though berlin continues to have a different position on iraq .
german diplomats said the letter from bush went far beyond the normal perfunctory congratulations .
germany receives president 's letter ethusiastically " the american expectations that germany would be a close ally are still being fulfilled and will continue to be valid , " voigt said in a statement to reuters .

tensions between the united states and germany over chancellor gerhard schroeder 's firm anti-war stance on iraq eased on thursday when president bush congratulated germany on the 12th anniversary of unification . one million people , including former u.s. president bill clinton , gathered for the unveiling of the restored brandenburg gate on thursday as germany celebrated 12 years as a reunited nation .
the mood was lifted further after a pledge of friendship was received from president george bush after weeks of tension between the two countries over iraq .
while the public holiday focused attention on the lingering gaps between eastern and western germans , it also gave u.s. and german leaders an occasion to subdue their festering dispute over policy toward iraq .
bush , who pointedly ignored schroeder 's re-election two weeks ago , ended a period of chilled silence that has marred the pivotal relationship in past weeks with a warm letter to german president johannes rau , praising close german-american ties over the last 200 years .
president 's warm wishes revive ' poisoned ' relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schroeder begin the journey back to reconcilliation .
" i extend to you and the people of germany my warmest wishes on the anniversary of german unification , " wrote bush after top administration officials said last month relations had been " poisoned " by schroeder 's anti-war position .
the president 's congratulations recalled the mutual bonds built up during decades of u.s. backing for former west germany and west berlin during the cold war .
" the united states stood firmly with germany 's people in our common goal of bringing freedom to a united germany , " he said in the breakthrough letter .
" the end of communism and the fall of the berlin wall were a great success for both our nations . "

tensions between the united states and germany over chancellor gerhard schroeder 's firm anti-war stance on iraq eased on thursday when president bush congratulated germany on the 12th anniversary of unification . one million people , including former u.s. president bill clinton , gathered for the unveiling of the restored brandenburg gate on thursday as germany celebrated 12 years as a reunited nation .
the mood was lifted further after a pledge of friendship was received from president george bush after weeks of tension between the two countries over iraq .
while the public holiday focused attention on the lingering gaps between eastern and western germans , it also gave u.s. and german leaders an occasion to subdue their festering dispute over policy toward iraq .
bush , who pointedly ignored schroeder 's re-election two weeks ago , ended a period of chilled silence that has marred the pivotal relationship in past weeks with a warm letter to german president johannes rau , praising close german-american ties over the last 200 years .
president 's warm wishes revive ' poisoned ' relationship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schroeder begin the journey back to reconcilliation .
" i extend to you and the people of germany my warmest wishes on the anniversary of german unification , " wrote bush after top administration officials said last month relations had been " poisoned " by schroeder 's anti-war position .
the president 's congratulations recalled the mutual bonds built up during decades of u.s. backing for former west germany and west berlin during the cold war .
" the united states stood firmly with germany 's people in our common goal of bringing freedom to a united germany , " he said in the breakthrough letter .
" the end of communism and the fall of the berlin wall were a great success for both our nations . "
' shared democratic values deepen the bond ' says bush " the german and american people have ties that date back to the establishment of our nation .
over the past half century , those bonds were deepened by a shared commitment to democratic values " , he said .
even though germany 's centre-left government remains opposed to any " military adventures " in iraq , government officials in berlin seized on the letter from bush , seeing it as a signal that the period of frosty relations between the allies had started to thaw .
chancellor schroeder 's co-ordinator for u.s. policy , karsten voigt , said the letter was evidence that the close german-american alliance was still intact even though berlin continues to have a different position on iraq .
german diplomats said the letter from bush went far beyond the normal perfunctory congratulations .
germany receives president 's letter ethusiastically " the american expectations that germany would be a close ally are still being fulfilled and will continue to be valid , " voigt said in a statement to reuters .
" the treatment of iraq is still a problem for germany and the united states .
it 's time for the weapons inspectors to return , not threaten military strikes . "
the healing process is still in its early stages , with the iraq issue the main stumbling block .
speaking in paris late on wednesday evening after a meeting with french president jacques chirac , gerhard schroeder said he would not alter his position opposing war in iraq .
" we defined our position before the election , " schroeder said .
" after the election in germany , nothing has changed .

myrna mack was stabbed to death aged 39 outside her office in guatemala city in 1990 , and a junior officer had been found guilty of her murder in 1993 .
thousands died in guatemala 's civil war but it is extremely rare for any top-ranking military officer to face atrocity charges arising from the 36-year civil war , which ended in 1996 .
former colonel juan valencia osorio , who was an assistant director of the presidential guard , was sentenced to 30 years in prison by the court in guatemala city .
two other defendants , retired general edgar godoy and former colonel juan guillermo oliva were cleared of ordering the murder .
' state enemy ' prosecutors had told the court that ms mack had been targeted by the military , after she produced a report in 1990 , blaming state-controlled anti-insurgency campaigns for killing hundreds of mayan indians .
the defence had argued that the presidential guard had existed solely to protect the head of state and that mack had been no danger to the army .
" this is the lynching of military men , " said defence lawyer sergio castro .
but prosecutor roberto romero told the court that mack had known too much about the way peasants were targeted during the civil war .
" that turned her into an enemy of the state and an assassination target , " he said .
un criticism the presidential guard has been blamed for a number of assassinations .
the bbc 's correspondent in mexico city nick miles says that whilst the conviction shows the willingness of judges to deal with guatemala 's past , recent reports from the united nations mission in guatemala , minugua , are critical of the country 's human rights record .
in recent months dozens of people working to bring former politicians to trial for their part in wartime atrocities have been intimidated .
minugua also points out that many key parts of the 1996 peace accords have not been implemented .
two presidents have failed to fulfil promises made in the peace accords that the presidential guard be turned into a civilian force .
the case is thought to be only the second time guatemalan military leaders have been put on trial for wartime crimes .
in june 2001 , the same court in guatemala city sentenced three soldiers and a priest to lengthy prison terms for their roles in the assassination of bishop juan gerardi . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's nick miles reports from mexico city " colonel valencia 's convictions shows the willingness of judges to deal with guatemala 's past " see also : 03 sep 02 -pipe- americas guatemala tries civil war officers 05 mar 02 -pipe- americas guatemala scientists receive death threats 12 dec 01 -pipe- americas guatemala massacre compensation 14 jun 01 -pipe- americas guatemala court orders genocide probe 06 jul 01 -pipe- americas guatemalan maya bury their war dead 10 aug 00 -pipe- americas guatemala admits state killing role 20 feb 02 -pipe- country profiles country profile : guatemala internet links : guatemalan government the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top americas stories now : us draws up second iraq resolution chicago club owners face charges peru 's ex-spy chief on public trial venezuela signs non-violence pact us plays down n korean threat us struggles to clear snow hacker breaches credit card security bolivian cabinet resigns links to more americas stories are at the foot of the page .

the scottish environment protection agency -lrb- sepa -rrb- said a majority of farmers in ayrshire were willing to back a new drive .
bathing water in ayrshire has had a notoriously patchy record meeting european standards .
sepa warned that farmers could face legal action if they do not make changes to their practices to help water quality .
the action is targeted at bathing water this year all designated beaches in ayrshire met european standards for the first time , prompting sepa to warn against complacency .
scottish water has spent £ 116m on new sewage works , but must spend yet more to deal with domestic effluent .
however , the newly created national water authority said its research suggests that during heavy rain farm pollution is swept down rivers to the sea , undoing some of the improvements .
a team from sepa has spent the summer visiting nearly 700 farms giving advice on how to prevent slurry running into water courses .
a spokesman said the majority of those farmers were co-operating , sometimes at considerable expenses , but that legal sanctions could be sought against those who do not comply .

conservation groups have expressed concern about the figures , but the east of england development agency -lrb- eeda -rrb- has warned if development land is not provided , the region will lose business to other parts of the country or even abroad .
housing development could see villages near stansted airport in essex swallowed up and a new settlement in cambridgeshire while new towns such as milton keynes and stevenage are set to expand into green field areas - and other more established regional centres such as norwich and ipswich are also facing the need for more homes .
land is still being wasted in a criminal way henry oliver , cpre figures from local county structure plans across the east region and development agency studies suggest a scale of development that will lead to major planning battles for decades to come .
steve cox , the eeda infrastructure and development manager , said the aim would be for housing development " without loss of green belt " where possible .
but , he added : " there will be a requirement for housing on the edge of towns and green field land sites and asking whether new settlements are required .
" we have to work to make sure any development is done in the most sensitive and sensible way and supported with an infrastructure . "
he said the danger of putting a stop to building was damaging the local and british economy .

he said there will be pressure on areas near london such as harlow , stevenage and basildon and the stansted area , while areas such as luton and dunstable are in need of regeneration .
mr cox said cambridge " will be a subject of growth " and proposals for an airport at alconbury may free up the land at cambridge airport for development .
he also believes there are pressures for industrial and housing land near ipswich and norwich .
but the reasons behind the official estimates of the need for 400,000 new homes have been questioned by some planning experts .

mr oliver said even if the estimates turn out to be accurate , planners need to push for better use of the available land .
' best land use ' at present housebuilders are producing 25 homes per hectare , while the government range is for 30 to 50 homes per hectare .
" land is still being wasted in a criminal way , " he said .
" before we release green field land we should make the best use of the land we develop . "
hugh ellis , planning advisor with friends of the earth , said without national planning , industry will grow and more homes will be built in east anglia and the south of england .

i do love the steak bake pasties and the sausage rolls mike darrington , greggs but after nearly 20 years of tucking into his company 's products , mike darrington shows no signs of running to fat .
as managing director of the bakery chain greggs , he believes that tasting the goods is part of his job .
it is also clearly an aspect that he enjoys .
" i like the big selling lines , " he says .
" i do love the steak bake pasties and the sausage rolls and the jam doughnuts , belgian buns ... "
before he works his way through every item of food he sells , i press him for a favourite .
" one product we only sell in yorkshire - it 's a slice , a pastry slice with egg custard and a sort of cream filling .
" it 's absolutely mouth-watering , it 's naughty but it 's a lovely product , " he says .
getting it wrong cakes , savouries and sandwiches are what greggs is all about .
it started as a bakery on gosforth high street in newcastle , floated on the stock market in 1984 and now has a chain of 1,180 shops .
greggs is targeting more uk towns it is about to make its first foray overseas .
taking belgian buns to belgium , if you like .
it could be argued that the company has been slow to look outside the uk .
but mr darrington 's style is to be cautious : " we 're planning to go at it very sedately .
" we know we 'll get it wrong to start with , but we 'll learn from it . "
viennoiserie he hopes to have three or four shops open by the spring , and will judge how successful they are before deciding the next move .
and if the belgians take to the british sandwich and sausage roll , then france , holland or germany could be next .
we experimented with really healthy options and it really killed the business mike darrington mr darrington politely declines to give details of the products that would be on offer in belgium .
but he says the shops would work in the same way they do in the uk with " core products " as well as local lines - in yorkshire , for example the local line is that naughty yorkshire pastry slice .
so belgians could expect to find greggs selling the sort of things they are already eating , such as viennoiserie , alongside sandwiches .
more sausage rolls i meet mike darrington at one of his shops in london 's west end .
there is a starbucks practically next door , which , you might think , would be bad for business .
not so , says mr darrington .
they are serving two very different markets - one specialises in coffee but sells some food .
the other specialises in sandwiches and savouries but also sells coffee .
and , apparently , what the take-away public wants more than anything else is sausage rolls .
one hundred million of them were sold last year .
satisfying customers so where does greggs stand on healthy eating ?
" we experimented with really healthy options and it really killed the business . "
we 're very determinedly aimed at the majority of people in the country mike darrington greggs the company decided to try using very low-fat mayonnaise at one of its units through the whole range of sandwiches , and sales collapsed .
" we have got to sell things that people want , " says mr darrington .
" if you try and sell things that people do n't want you have n't got a business . "
that seems to have been the philosophy all along .
convenience food when greggs floated on the stock market , 40 % of its business was selling bread and rolls .
that now makes up just 10 % .
part of the change has been driven by competition from the supermarkets .
" we could see the supermarkets were going to beat us on bread and rolls because of convenience , " mr darrington said .
but , he says , for people who want to come out of their office and buy a take-away sandwich , greggs is more convenient .
" we believe we are better than most people but we believe we should be a survivor and a thriver . "
neither nasty nor exclusive he is aware that he might sound a bit complacent , and is quick to say that the company is always looking at what others are doing and making sure it does not lose ground .
will the belgians take to jam doughnuts ?
and he says that in some towns there are specialist sandwich shops that are really excellent .
but he knows his market .
" we 're very determinedly aimed at the majority of people in the country .
" we want a £ 1.50 sandwich that 's really going to be good .
" we 're neither the cheap and nasty end , nor are we the niche exclusive market end . "
tripping up mr darrington has already overseen the huge growth in the business , including the takeover of bakers oven , and he says greggs will become even bigger .
as well as looking overseas , the group is planning to open hundreds more shops in the parts of the uk it has not yet reached .
but you can be sure that the company will be taking it slowly .
" if you try to do too many things at once you fall over your shoelaces , " says mr darrington . watch / listen on this story mike darrington , greggs " europe is a very interesting market for us " see also : 23 sep 02 -pipe- business supermarkets giants ' mull safeway bid ' 19 sep 02 -pipe- business why uk retailers keep making money 18 sep 02 -pipe- business why cheap beans do n't make cheap coffee 09 sep 02 -pipe- business uk shopping boom roars on 09 sep 02 -pipe- business shoppers wooed to farmers markets 08 mar 02 -pipe- business uk baker cooks up expansion plans internet links : greggs the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : hacker breaches credit card security job losses escalate at reuters new sec chief pledges tough line oil prices push higher rwanda denies drc plundering overseas sales drive wal-mart congo 's finance minister resigns blair keeps euro options open links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

the agency , quoting sources " familiar with " the matter , said echostar communications ' $ 23bn purchase of hughes electronics faced rejection by watchdog the federal communications commission .
a failure of the takeover could hand media tycoon rupert murdoch a fresh chance to merge hughes ' directv business with his skyglobal network .
' too soon to say ' but fcc declined to comment on the report .
and a spokesman for hughes said it was premature to comment on the watchdog 's decision .
" this is simply speculation , " spokesman richard dore told bloomberg .
" they 're still collecting information . "
an echostar spokesman said the firm was continuing to work with federal officials assessing the merger .
" we believe the merger is good for consumers and should be approved based upon its merits , " spokesman marc lumpkin said .
decision soon ?
directv is the main satellite tv provider in the us with 10 million subscribers , while echostar owns the second-ranked service , with 6.7 million viewers .
an fcc dossier being compiled on the merger reportedly opposes it on the grounds of preserving consumer choice .
the fcc 's four commissioners are likely to vote this month on the staff recommendation to oppose the transaction , bloomberg reported , citing people familiar with the matter .
the fcc 's lawyers are believed to have concluded that the merger could lead to consumers having to shell out more money for pay-tv .
federal competition watchdogs are also said to be preparing to ask the us justice department to oppose the merger .
they held meetings - normal in the case of big mergers - with hughes executives on 24 september at which they said no decisions had been taken , a letter from the firm to its staff said .
murdoch 's ambitions charles james , the chief anti-trust lawyer at the justice department , told a senate hearing last month that a tie up between echostar and directv would " at best " cut the number of players in the sector from three to two .
but echostar claims that , without the merger , it would be unable to compete with cable tv providers such as at & t. mr murdoch pulled out of the competition for directv last year , angered at the indecision of its ultimate parent firm general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- after months of negotiations .
mr murdoch had hoped to merge directv with the sky global network owned by his news corp media empire , creating a worldwide platform to distribute its huge portfolio of tv shows and films .

the rise means house prices have increased by 24.2 % over the past year .
halifax , the uk 's biggest mortgage lender , said the continuing strength of the market had caused it to revise up to 24 % , from 15 % , its forecast for annual house price inflation at the end of 2002 .
the move comes three days after building society nationwide uprated by five percentage points , to 23 % , its estimate for price growth this year .
onwards and upwards halifax group economist martin ellis said the market continued to be driven by low interest rates , falling unemployment and a shortage of properties for sale .
average house prices greater london : £ 206,425 south east : £ 174,126 south west : £ 140,940 east anglia : £ 119,932 west midlands : £ 104,536 east midlands : £ 103,653 northern ireland : £ 79,907 north west : £ 79,205 wales : £ 76,359 yorks & humber : £ 71,334 scotland : £ 68,648 north : £ 68,010 source : halifax and he added that a change in outlook for the future direction of interest rates may have added to september 's surge .
" homebuyers are no longer expecting an imminent rise in rates with increasing speculation that the next move in interest rates may indeed be downwards , " mr ellis said .
the bank said last month 's strong annual figure could be explained in part by its comparison with september 2001 , when the terror strikes on the us led to a 0.2 % fall in uk house prices .
but the survey also showed prices growing strongly throughout the uk , with inflation picking up outside the south of england .
the east midlands hosted the country 's strongest housing market , with prices rising at an annual rate of 37.6 % in the july to september period .
the average price of a house in both the west and east midlands broke through the £ 100,000 barrier during this period , while the average price in greater london rose above £ 200,000 .
slowdown on the way ?
mr ellis added that halifax still expected the housing market to slow gradually over the next year .
" the difficulties faced by first-time buyers in the south , in particular , will constrain demand and cause house price inflation to ease , " he said .
the average house price was now £ 116,801 , up from £ 111,968 in august , halifax added .
