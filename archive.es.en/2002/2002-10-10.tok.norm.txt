a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .
content of book likely to agitate catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldhagen holds the catholic church responsible for not protecting the jews .
some of the book 's core research material appeared as a 27,000-word essay in the american political magazine " the new republic " in january .
in the essay , goldhagen reiterates widely reported allegations that suggest that pius xii , the wartime pope , did not do enough to protect the jews , even though he likely knew of the fate which awaited them .
the vatican has always argued that its cautious , non-confrontational policy saved more people than would have been the case if it had spoken out in condemnation of the nazis .
goldhagen says such arguments are bizarre and nonsensical , topped only by those of revisionist historians , who try to argue the holocaust never actually happen .
goldhagen , a professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is no stranger to controversy or ruffling the feathers of germans .
his best-known book , hitler 's willing executioners , blamed ordinary germans for the holocaust .
although some critics accused him of taking liberties with the truth and writing in a confrontational style , the book became a best-seller and award winner . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .
" we have accused him of having been active in the group .
we have issued the arrest warrant on the firm suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization , " nehm told reporters after mzoudi was detained .
the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .
therefore , it is also very likely that mzoudi knew about the planned targets in the u.s.
" the accused knew the organization ’ s goals of launching terrorist attacks and supported it logistically , " nehm told the press .
the hamburg connection over the course of the last few years mzoudi shared a three-room apartment with atta and maintained close contact to al shehhi , binalshibh and said bahaji , another member of the terrorist cell still at large .
in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .
for years the young men going in and out of atta ’ s apartment went unnoticed by german authorities .
it wasn ’ t until events quickly began unfolding after last year ’ s attacks that authorities began to take a closer look at the activities of marienstraße 54 , and an entire terrorist network came to light .
profile of the accused rolf tophoven , a german expert on terrorism , said on dw-radio that the profile of mzoudi " exactly matches the profile of the whole group around mohammed atta .
they all had one thing in common : they received extensive training at camps in afghanistan .
obviously the accused had knowledge of the targets in the u.s. and probably also other selected targets in western europe . "
tophoven stressed that mzoudi and mounir el motassadeq , another suspected member of the hamburg al qaeda cell who goes on trial later this month , are only the tip of the iceberg .
when it comes to uncovering the terrorist network in germany , the authorities have only begin putting the pieces together , he said .
germany ’ s federal prosecutor admitted that investigations into the hamburg group had been difficult but also successful .
" what we have achieved so far is excellent in international comparison .
no other country has come this far , " nehm told reporters .
on friday mzoudi will be brought before an investigating judge of the federal supreme court in karlsruhe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany the past year has been an illuminating one for german anti-terrorism investigators .

i 'm reading far from killing off the printed word , the internet is actually creating new opportunities for the publishing industry - but is it helping or just making things worse ? at the 54th frankfurt book fair , which runs from oct .
9-14 , the general atmosphere is one of foreboding and doom .
one of the key issues this year is the decline in annual book sales and the much-needed restructuring of the german publishing industry .
after years of growth , the industry is suffering its first real economic slump .
at first glance , advances in technology could be held partly responsible for this .
in fact , however , new media is giving a helping hand to the ailing publishing industry .
it is the single ray of light that has broken the gloom of the annual book fair .
originally , the internet was heralded as the death knell for the printed word .
a technological wonder that would make the need to search through dusty old book stores a thing of the past .
there , on shiny screens , would be the pages we once flicked through and whose corners we bent .
the internet was set to revolutionise literature .
and it has .
but not in the same way as many net boosters claimed it would .
each year technology buffs talk of the end of the book as we know it , even as printed and bound volumes continued to sell like hotcakes .
what has happened , however , is that the internet has become a rival to the conventional way we buy our books .
time to take advantage of technology , say publishers judging by the opinion of 45 per cent of german publishing houses , the time of cost-free internet bargains is over .
it is time to utilise the medium for the benefit of publishing while avoiding napster 's give-away philosophy , which some argue has crippled the music industry .
a boom in electronic media has seen the popularity of electronic , or e-books , improve dramatically .
around one million of these online versions of books , which can be downloaded for a fee , have been bought this year on the internet , hermann salmen , chief executive of the e-book publisher gemstar ebook told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
handheld ebooks , personal digital assistant-sized computers , have also become popular ways of receiving the manuscripts .
pda 's can carry over 4,000 pages of text or the equivalent of ten books .
it is an area of the book market that looks set to expand .
three-out-of-five publishing houses say that they want the percentage of their revenue from electronic books to increase to between five and 20 per cent in the next five years .
in most cases , it is currently less than five per cent , according to a survey recently conducted by the working group for electronic publishing of the german publishers and booksellers association .
around a fifth of publishers who currently produce electronic publications make a profit from the enterprise while a further 44 per cent break even , according to a report released at the book fair on wednesday by the same group .
still room for both markets to grow but far from becoming a deathmatch between tradition and technology , most of the big publishers agree there is plenty of room for both print and electronic publishing .
" the internet isn ’ t eating up books , it ’ s writing new ones , " matthias winter , manager of an internet encyclopaedia established by german publishing giant bertelsmann , told the news agency dpa . the company is currently showing off both its reference web site and its most recent print publication , a guide to the site that is already producing healthy sales at the frankfurt book fair .
online shopping has also provided the possibility of a new literary market , allowing those people who would not normally spend hours in a book shop to find the publications they want .
sales of books - the hard copy , real thing - have increased over the internet due to the ease with which literature can be found and paid for .
titles from all over the world have become available at the click of a button and all from the comfort of your own home .
the larger publishers and distributors have been quick to recognise the benefits .
online services have hit independent book shops hard however , it is not all good news as the gloomy atmosphere at the book fair testifies .
as a result of the increased popularity of e-books , online shopping and the advent of the book superstore , many independent bookshops have been forced to close .
with cheaper prices available from bulk stockists and online traders such as amazon , customers are choosing to make savings at the expense of the smaller outlets .
by 2005 , 10 percent of market is expected of publishing sales are expected to be conducted online , anderson forecasting has predicted .

key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .
" we have accused him of having been active in the group .
we have issued the arrest warrant on the firm suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization , " nehm told reporters after mzoudi was detained .
the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .
therefore , it is also very likely that mzoudi knew about the planned targets in the u.s.
" the accused knew the organization ’ s goals of launching terrorist attacks and supported it logistically , " nehm told the press .
the hamburg connection over the course of the last few years mzoudi shared a three-room apartment with atta and maintained close contact to al shehhi , binalshibh and said bahaji , another member of the terrorist cell still at large .
in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .
for years the young men going in and out of atta ’ s apartment went unnoticed by german authorities .
it wasn ’ t until events quickly began unfolding after last year ’ s attacks that authorities began to take a closer look at the activities of marienstraße 54 , and an entire terrorist network came to light .
profile of the accused rolf tophoven , a german expert on terrorism , said on dw-radio that the profile of mzoudi " exactly matches the profile of the whole group around mohammed atta .
they all had one thing in common : they received extensive training at camps in afghanistan .
obviously the accused had knowledge of the targets in the u.s. and probably also other selected targets in western europe . "
tophoven stressed that mzoudi and mounir el motassadeq , another suspected member of the hamburg al qaeda cell who goes on trial later this month , are only the tip of the iceberg .
when it comes to uncovering the terrorist network in germany , the authorities have only begin putting the pieces together , he said .
germany ’ s federal prosecutor admitted that investigations into the hamburg group had been difficult but also successful .
" what we have achieved so far is excellent in international comparison .
no other country has come this far , " nehm told reporters .

key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .
" we have accused him of having been active in the group .
we have issued the arrest warrant on the firm suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization , " nehm told reporters after mzoudi was detained .
the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .
therefore , it is also very likely that mzoudi knew about the planned targets in the u.s.
" the accused knew the organization ’ s goals of launching terrorist attacks and supported it logistically , " nehm told the press .
the hamburg connection over the course of the last few years mzoudi shared a three-room apartment with atta and maintained close contact to al shehhi , binalshibh and said bahaji , another member of the terrorist cell still at large .
in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .
for years the young men going in and out of atta ’ s apartment went unnoticed by german authorities .
it wasn ’ t until events quickly began unfolding after last year ’ s attacks that authorities began to take a closer look at the activities of marienstraße 54 , and an entire terrorist network came to light .
profile of the accused rolf tophoven , a german expert on terrorism , said on dw-radio that the profile of mzoudi " exactly matches the profile of the whole group around mohammed atta .
they all had one thing in common : they received extensive training at camps in afghanistan .
obviously the accused had knowledge of the targets in the u.s. and probably also other selected targets in western europe . "
tophoven stressed that mzoudi and mounir el motassadeq , another suspected member of the hamburg al qaeda cell who goes on trial later this month , are only the tip of the iceberg .
when it comes to uncovering the terrorist network in germany , the authorities have only begin putting the pieces together , he said .
germany ’ s federal prosecutor admitted that investigations into the hamburg group had been difficult but also successful .
" what we have achieved so far is excellent in international comparison .
no other country has come this far , " nehm told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair opening a new chapter in the publishing industry book sales slump closing the book on small bookstores nigerian writer wins german peace prize culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.10.2002 lithuanian authors feted at book fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is much to discover about lithuania 's literature at the frankfurt book fair although it 's located at the geographical centre of europe , many still see lithuania as part of the east .
this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .
with the help of the frankfurt book fair , this easily overlooked country on europe 's eastern border hopes to attract more public awareness in western europe to its unique literary cultural landscape .
" to be continued " the motto " to be continued " is an allusion to " the frequent interruption of the development of the country by wars and occupation " , according to the organisers , and is a " reflection of the intention of the presentation : to concentrate on the contemporary scene , without forgetting it ’ s history . "
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .
" the most important works were written after the war , in exile " , said german author marianna butenschön , an expert in lithuanian literature .
a new era the collapse of communism and lithuania 's successive independence in 1989 saw the start of a new era for lithuanian literature .
a new generation of authors appeared on the international literary stage – lithuanian authors returned after years in exile .
in addition , numerous translated manuscripts written by these writers in the years of lithuania 's occupation underwent yet another translation – this time back into their original language .
one author who experienced these changes is ricardas gavelis , who published his novel vilna poker in 1989 , a book which he had completed two years before publication .
too much human flesh gavelis ' book , which protested both against the russian regime and against the supporting powers in lithuania , was met with controversy his own home country , especially among those who felt the need to protect their former life under communism and lithuanian traditions .
but his was not the only book published after 1989 that ignited controversy .
books which included the human body and the inner self , subjects that were for years taboo under the strict regime , were met with disgust , not least due to lithuania 's large catholic community .
however , the country 's young authors remained undeterred in their literary work .
" the young authors who began writing after the fall of communism are a lot more open when it comes to dealing with tradition and set forms , and also with their own bodies , " says ausrine jonikaite , lithuanian coordinator at the frankfurt book fair .
banned books in 1993 , 39-year-old jurga ivanauskaite 's book rain witch was banned .
a love story told by three women - a modern-day bohemian outsider , a medieval witch and mary magdalene - it was immediately condemned in official circles as pornography .
jurga ivanauskaite resolved to leave the country .
ironically , she is today one of the country 's most well known writers of lithuanian contemporary literature .
struggling literary scene ivanauskaite is one of 26 lithuanian authors taking part in the frankfurt book fair .
but their presence can not hide the fact that authors from this country can still not survive from writing alone , and that lithuania is still struggling to establish a professional literary scene .
sales are , in comparison to former communist times , low , and not one of the 300 registered authors can compete with western literature .

i 'm reading far from killing off the printed word , the internet is actually creating new opportunities for the publishing industry - but is it helping or just making things worse ? at the 54th frankfurt book fair , which runs from oct .
9-14 , the general atmosphere is one of foreboding and doom .
one of the key issues this year is the decline in annual book sales and the much-needed restructuring of the german publishing industry .
after years of growth , the industry is suffering its first real economic slump .
at first glance , advances in technology could be held partly responsible for this .
in fact , however , new media is giving a helping hand to the ailing publishing industry .
it is the single ray of light that has broken the gloom of the annual book fair .
originally , the internet was heralded as the death knell for the printed word .
a technological wonder that would make the need to search through dusty old book stores a thing of the past .
there , on shiny screens , would be the pages we once flicked through and whose corners we bent .
the internet was set to revolutionise literature .
and it has .
but not in the same way as many net boosters claimed it would .
each year technology buffs talk of the end of the book as we know it , even as printed and bound volumes continued to sell like hotcakes .
what has happened , however , is that the internet has become a rival to the conventional way we buy our books .
time to take advantage of technology , say publishers judging by the opinion of 45 per cent of german publishing houses , the time of cost-free internet bargains is over .
it is time to utilise the medium for the benefit of publishing while avoiding napster 's give-away philosophy , which some argue has crippled the music industry .
a boom in electronic media has seen the popularity of electronic , or e-books , improve dramatically .
around one million of these online versions of books , which can be downloaded for a fee , have been bought this year on the internet , hermann salmen , chief executive of the e-book publisher gemstar ebook told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
handheld ebooks , personal digital assistant-sized computers , have also become popular ways of receiving the manuscripts .
pda 's can carry over 4,000 pages of text or the equivalent of ten books .
it is an area of the book market that looks set to expand .
three-out-of-five publishing houses say that they want the percentage of their revenue from electronic books to increase to between five and 20 per cent in the next five years .
in most cases , it is currently less than five per cent , according to a survey recently conducted by the working group for electronic publishing of the german publishers and booksellers association .
around a fifth of publishers who currently produce electronic publications make a profit from the enterprise while a further 44 per cent break even , according to a report released at the book fair on wednesday by the same group .
still room for both markets to grow but far from becoming a deathmatch between tradition and technology , most of the big publishers agree there is plenty of room for both print and electronic publishing .
" the internet isn ’ t eating up books , it ’ s writing new ones , " matthias winter , manager of an internet encyclopaedia established by german publishing giant bertelsmann , told the news agency dpa . the company is currently showing off both its reference web site and its most recent print publication , a guide to the site that is already producing healthy sales at the frankfurt book fair .
online shopping has also provided the possibility of a new literary market , allowing those people who would not normally spend hours in a book shop to find the publications they want .
sales of books - the hard copy , real thing - have increased over the internet due to the ease with which literature can be found and paid for .
titles from all over the world have become available at the click of a button and all from the comfort of your own home .
the larger publishers and distributors have been quick to recognise the benefits .

this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .
with the help of the frankfurt book fair , this easily overlooked country on europe 's eastern border hopes to attract more public awareness in western europe to its unique literary cultural landscape .
" to be continued " the motto " to be continued " is an allusion to " the frequent interruption of the development of the country by wars and occupation " , according to the organisers , and is a " reflection of the intention of the presentation : to concentrate on the contemporary scene , without forgetting it ’ s history . "
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .
" the most important works were written after the war , in exile " , said german author marianna butenschön , an expert in lithuanian literature .
a new era the collapse of communism and lithuania 's successive independence in 1989 saw the start of a new era for lithuanian literature .
a new generation of authors appeared on the international literary stage – lithuanian authors returned after years in exile .
in addition , numerous translated manuscripts written by these writers in the years of lithuania 's occupation underwent yet another translation – this time back into their original language .
one author who experienced these changes is ricardas gavelis , who published his novel vilna poker in 1989 , a book which he had completed two years before publication .
too much human flesh gavelis ' book , which protested both against the russian regime and against the supporting powers in lithuania , was met with controversy his own home country , especially among those who felt the need to protect their former life under communism and lithuanian traditions .
but his was not the only book published after 1989 that ignited controversy .
books which included the human body and the inner self , subjects that were for years taboo under the strict regime , were met with disgust , not least due to lithuania 's large catholic community .
however , the country 's young authors remained undeterred in their literary work .
" the young authors who began writing after the fall of communism are a lot more open when it comes to dealing with tradition and set forms , and also with their own bodies , " says ausrine jonikaite , lithuanian coordinator at the frankfurt book fair .
banned books in 1993 , 39-year-old jurga ivanauskaite 's book rain witch was banned .
a love story told by three women - a modern-day bohemian outsider , a medieval witch and mary magdalene - it was immediately condemned in official circles as pornography .
jurga ivanauskaite resolved to leave the country .
ironically , she is today one of the country 's most well known writers of lithuanian contemporary literature .
struggling literary scene ivanauskaite is one of 26 lithuanian authors taking part in the frankfurt book fair .
but their presence can not hide the fact that authors from this country can still not survive from writing alone , and that lithuania is still struggling to establish a professional literary scene .

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .
content of book likely to agitate catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldhagen holds the catholic church responsible for not protecting the jews .
some of the book 's core research material appeared as a 27,000-word essay in the american political magazine " the new republic " in january .
in the essay , goldhagen reiterates widely reported allegations that suggest that pius xii , the wartime pope , did not do enough to protect the jews , even though he likely knew of the fate which awaited them .
the vatican has always argued that its cautious , non-confrontational policy saved more people than would have been the case if it had spoken out in condemnation of the nazis .
goldhagen says such arguments are bizarre and nonsensical , topped only by those of revisionist historians , who try to argue the holocaust never actually happen .
goldhagen , a professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is no stranger to controversy or ruffling the feathers of germans .

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .
content of book likely to agitate catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldhagen holds the catholic church responsible for not protecting the jews .
some of the book 's core research material appeared as a 27,000-word essay in the american political magazine " the new republic " in january .
in the essay , goldhagen reiterates widely reported allegations that suggest that pius xii , the wartime pope , did not do enough to protect the jews , even though he likely knew of the fate which awaited them .
the vatican has always argued that its cautious , non-confrontational policy saved more people than would have been the case if it had spoken out in condemnation of the nazis .
goldhagen says such arguments are bizarre and nonsensical , topped only by those of revisionist historians , who try to argue the holocaust never actually happen .
goldhagen , a professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is no stranger to controversy or ruffling the feathers of germans .
his best-known book , hitler 's willing executioners , blamed ordinary germans for the holocaust .

i 'm reading far from killing off the printed word , the internet is actually creating new opportunities for the publishing industry - but is it helping or just making things worse ? at the 54th frankfurt book fair , which runs from oct .
9-14 , the general atmosphere is one of foreboding and doom .
one of the key issues this year is the decline in annual book sales and the much-needed restructuring of the german publishing industry .
after years of growth , the industry is suffering its first real economic slump .
at first glance , advances in technology could be held partly responsible for this .
in fact , however , new media is giving a helping hand to the ailing publishing industry .
it is the single ray of light that has broken the gloom of the annual book fair .
originally , the internet was heralded as the death knell for the printed word .
a technological wonder that would make the need to search through dusty old book stores a thing of the past .
there , on shiny screens , would be the pages we once flicked through and whose corners we bent .
the internet was set to revolutionise literature .
and it has .
but not in the same way as many net boosters claimed it would .
each year technology buffs talk of the end of the book as we know it , even as printed and bound volumes continued to sell like hotcakes .
what has happened , however , is that the internet has become a rival to the conventional way we buy our books .
time to take advantage of technology , say publishers judging by the opinion of 45 per cent of german publishing houses , the time of cost-free internet bargains is over .
it is time to utilise the medium for the benefit of publishing while avoiding napster 's give-away philosophy , which some argue has crippled the music industry .
a boom in electronic media has seen the popularity of electronic , or e-books , improve dramatically .
around one million of these online versions of books , which can be downloaded for a fee , have been bought this year on the internet , hermann salmen , chief executive of the e-book publisher gemstar ebook told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
handheld ebooks , personal digital assistant-sized computers , have also become popular ways of receiving the manuscripts .
pda 's can carry over 4,000 pages of text or the equivalent of ten books .
it is an area of the book market that looks set to expand .
three-out-of-five publishing houses say that they want the percentage of their revenue from electronic books to increase to between five and 20 per cent in the next five years .
in most cases , it is currently less than five per cent , according to a survey recently conducted by the working group for electronic publishing of the german publishers and booksellers association .
around a fifth of publishers who currently produce electronic publications make a profit from the enterprise while a further 44 per cent break even , according to a report released at the book fair on wednesday by the same group .
still room for both markets to grow but far from becoming a deathmatch between tradition and technology , most of the big publishers agree there is plenty of room for both print and electronic publishing .
" the internet isn ’ t eating up books , it ’ s writing new ones , " matthias winter , manager of an internet encyclopaedia established by german publishing giant bertelsmann , told the news agency dpa . the company is currently showing off both its reference web site and its most recent print publication , a guide to the site that is already producing healthy sales at the frankfurt book fair .
online shopping has also provided the possibility of a new literary market , allowing those people who would not normally spend hours in a book shop to find the publications they want .
sales of books - the hard copy , real thing - have increased over the internet due to the ease with which literature can be found and paid for .
titles from all over the world have become available at the click of a button and all from the comfort of your own home .
the larger publishers and distributors have been quick to recognise the benefits .
online services have hit independent book shops hard however , it is not all good news as the gloomy atmosphere at the book fair testifies .
as a result of the increased popularity of e-books , online shopping and the advent of the book superstore , many independent bookshops have been forced to close .
with cheaper prices available from bulk stockists and online traders such as amazon , customers are choosing to make savings at the expense of the smaller outlets .
by 2005 , 10 percent of market is expected of publishing sales are expected to be conducted online , anderson forecasting has predicted .
despite these current problems in the publishing industry , the increasing popularity of the internet and the opportunities it provides for the future means books , in whatever form , are set to be with us for a long time to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair every year the international book fair in frankfurt attracts thousands of visitors , exhibitors and authors from around the world .

this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .
with the help of the frankfurt book fair , this easily overlooked country on europe 's eastern border hopes to attract more public awareness in western europe to its unique literary cultural landscape .
" to be continued " the motto " to be continued " is an allusion to " the frequent interruption of the development of the country by wars and occupation " , according to the organisers , and is a " reflection of the intention of the presentation : to concentrate on the contemporary scene , without forgetting it ’ s history . "
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .
" the most important works were written after the war , in exile " , said german author marianna butenschön , an expert in lithuanian literature .
a new era the collapse of communism and lithuania 's successive independence in 1989 saw the start of a new era for lithuanian literature .
a new generation of authors appeared on the international literary stage – lithuanian authors returned after years in exile .
in addition , numerous translated manuscripts written by these writers in the years of lithuania 's occupation underwent yet another translation – this time back into their original language .
one author who experienced these changes is ricardas gavelis , who published his novel vilna poker in 1989 , a book which he had completed two years before publication .
too much human flesh gavelis ' book , which protested both against the russian regime and against the supporting powers in lithuania , was met with controversy his own home country , especially among those who felt the need to protect their former life under communism and lithuanian traditions .
but his was not the only book published after 1989 that ignited controversy .
books which included the human body and the inner self , subjects that were for years taboo under the strict regime , were met with disgust , not least due to lithuania 's large catholic community .
however , the country 's young authors remained undeterred in their literary work .
" the young authors who began writing after the fall of communism are a lot more open when it comes to dealing with tradition and set forms , and also with their own bodies , " says ausrine jonikaite , lithuanian coordinator at the frankfurt book fair .
banned books in 1993 , 39-year-old jurga ivanauskaite 's book rain witch was banned .
a love story told by three women - a modern-day bohemian outsider , a medieval witch and mary magdalene - it was immediately condemned in official circles as pornography .
jurga ivanauskaite resolved to leave the country .
ironically , she is today one of the country 's most well known writers of lithuanian contemporary literature .
struggling literary scene ivanauskaite is one of 26 lithuanian authors taking part in the frankfurt book fair .
but their presence can not hide the fact that authors from this country can still not survive from writing alone , and that lithuania is still struggling to establish a professional literary scene .
sales are , in comparison to former communist times , low , and not one of the 300 registered authors can compete with western literature .

this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .
with the help of the frankfurt book fair , this easily overlooked country on europe 's eastern border hopes to attract more public awareness in western europe to its unique literary cultural landscape .
" to be continued " the motto " to be continued " is an allusion to " the frequent interruption of the development of the country by wars and occupation " , according to the organisers , and is a " reflection of the intention of the presentation : to concentrate on the contemporary scene , without forgetting it ’ s history . "
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .
" the most important works were written after the war , in exile " , said german author marianna butenschön , an expert in lithuanian literature .
a new era the collapse of communism and lithuania 's successive independence in 1989 saw the start of a new era for lithuanian literature .
a new generation of authors appeared on the international literary stage – lithuanian authors returned after years in exile .
in addition , numerous translated manuscripts written by these writers in the years of lithuania 's occupation underwent yet another translation – this time back into their original language .
one author who experienced these changes is ricardas gavelis , who published his novel vilna poker in 1989 , a book which he had completed two years before publication .
too much human flesh gavelis ' book , which protested both against the russian regime and against the supporting powers in lithuania , was met with controversy his own home country , especially among those who felt the need to protect their former life under communism and lithuanian traditions .
but his was not the only book published after 1989 that ignited controversy .
books which included the human body and the inner self , subjects that were for years taboo under the strict regime , were met with disgust , not least due to lithuania 's large catholic community .
however , the country 's young authors remained undeterred in their literary work .
" the young authors who began writing after the fall of communism are a lot more open when it comes to dealing with tradition and set forms , and also with their own bodies , " says ausrine jonikaite , lithuanian coordinator at the frankfurt book fair .
banned books in 1993 , 39-year-old jurga ivanauskaite 's book rain witch was banned .

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .
content of book likely to agitate catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldhagen holds the catholic church responsible for not protecting the jews .
some of the book 's core research material appeared as a 27,000-word essay in the american political magazine " the new republic " in january .
in the essay , goldhagen reiterates widely reported allegations that suggest that pius xii , the wartime pope , did not do enough to protect the jews , even though he likely knew of the fate which awaited them .
the vatican has always argued that its cautious , non-confrontational policy saved more people than would have been the case if it had spoken out in condemnation of the nazis .
goldhagen says such arguments are bizarre and nonsensical , topped only by those of revisionist historians , who try to argue the holocaust never actually happen .
goldhagen , a professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is no stranger to controversy or ruffling the feathers of germans .
his best-known book , hitler 's willing executioners , blamed ordinary germans for the holocaust .

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .
content of book likely to agitate catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldhagen holds the catholic church responsible for not protecting the jews .
some of the book 's core research material appeared as a 27,000-word essay in the american political magazine " the new republic " in january .
in the essay , goldhagen reiterates widely reported allegations that suggest that pius xii , the wartime pope , did not do enough to protect the jews , even though he likely knew of the fate which awaited them .
the vatican has always argued that its cautious , non-confrontational policy saved more people than would have been the case if it had spoken out in condemnation of the nazis .
goldhagen says such arguments are bizarre and nonsensical , topped only by those of revisionist historians , who try to argue the holocaust never actually happen .
goldhagen , a professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is no stranger to controversy or ruffling the feathers of germans .
his best-known book , hitler 's willing executioners , blamed ordinary germans for the holocaust .
although some critics accused him of taking liberties with the truth and writing in a confrontational style , the book became a best-seller and award winner . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .
with the help of the frankfurt book fair , this easily overlooked country on europe 's eastern border hopes to attract more public awareness in western europe to its unique literary cultural landscape .
" to be continued " the motto " to be continued " is an allusion to " the frequent interruption of the development of the country by wars and occupation " , according to the organisers , and is a " reflection of the intention of the presentation : to concentrate on the contemporary scene , without forgetting it ’ s history . "
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .
" the most important works were written after the war , in exile " , said german author marianna butenschön , an expert in lithuanian literature .
a new era the collapse of communism and lithuania 's successive independence in 1989 saw the start of a new era for lithuanian literature .
a new generation of authors appeared on the international literary stage – lithuanian authors returned after years in exile .
in addition , numerous translated manuscripts written by these writers in the years of lithuania 's occupation underwent yet another translation – this time back into their original language .
one author who experienced these changes is ricardas gavelis , who published his novel vilna poker in 1989 , a book which he had completed two years before publication .
too much human flesh gavelis ' book , which protested both against the russian regime and against the supporting powers in lithuania , was met with controversy his own home country , especially among those who felt the need to protect their former life under communism and lithuanian traditions .
but his was not the only book published after 1989 that ignited controversy .
books which included the human body and the inner self , subjects that were for years taboo under the strict regime , were met with disgust , not least due to lithuania 's large catholic community .
however , the country 's young authors remained undeterred in their literary work .
" the young authors who began writing after the fall of communism are a lot more open when it comes to dealing with tradition and set forms , and also with their own bodies , " says ausrine jonikaite , lithuanian coordinator at the frankfurt book fair .
banned books in 1993 , 39-year-old jurga ivanauskaite 's book rain witch was banned .
a love story told by three women - a modern-day bohemian outsider , a medieval witch and mary magdalene - it was immediately condemned in official circles as pornography .
jurga ivanauskaite resolved to leave the country .
ironically , she is today one of the country 's most well known writers of lithuanian contemporary literature .
struggling literary scene ivanauskaite is one of 26 lithuanian authors taking part in the frankfurt book fair .
but their presence can not hide the fact that authors from this country can still not survive from writing alone , and that lithuania is still struggling to establish a professional literary scene .

this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .
with the help of the frankfurt book fair , this easily overlooked country on europe 's eastern border hopes to attract more public awareness in western europe to its unique literary cultural landscape .
" to be continued " the motto " to be continued " is an allusion to " the frequent interruption of the development of the country by wars and occupation " , according to the organisers , and is a " reflection of the intention of the presentation : to concentrate on the contemporary scene , without forgetting it ’ s history . "
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .
" the most important works were written after the war , in exile " , said german author marianna butenschön , an expert in lithuanian literature .
a new era the collapse of communism and lithuania 's successive independence in 1989 saw the start of a new era for lithuanian literature .
a new generation of authors appeared on the international literary stage – lithuanian authors returned after years in exile .
in addition , numerous translated manuscripts written by these writers in the years of lithuania 's occupation underwent yet another translation – this time back into their original language .
one author who experienced these changes is ricardas gavelis , who published his novel vilna poker in 1989 , a book which he had completed two years before publication .
too much human flesh gavelis ' book , which protested both against the russian regime and against the supporting powers in lithuania , was met with controversy his own home country , especially among those who felt the need to protect their former life under communism and lithuanian traditions .
but his was not the only book published after 1989 that ignited controversy .
books which included the human body and the inner self , subjects that were for years taboo under the strict regime , were met with disgust , not least due to lithuania 's large catholic community .
however , the country 's young authors remained undeterred in their literary work .
" the young authors who began writing after the fall of communism are a lot more open when it comes to dealing with tradition and set forms , and also with their own bodies , " says ausrine jonikaite , lithuanian coordinator at the frankfurt book fair .
banned books in 1993 , 39-year-old jurga ivanauskaite 's book rain witch was banned .
a love story told by three women - a modern-day bohemian outsider , a medieval witch and mary magdalene - it was immediately condemned in official circles as pornography .
jurga ivanauskaite resolved to leave the country .
ironically , she is today one of the country 's most well known writers of lithuanian contemporary literature .
struggling literary scene ivanauskaite is one of 26 lithuanian authors taking part in the frankfurt book fair .
but their presence can not hide the fact that authors from this country can still not survive from writing alone , and that lithuania is still struggling to establish a professional literary scene .
sales are , in comparison to former communist times , low , and not one of the 300 registered authors can compete with western literature .

i 'm reading far from killing off the printed word , the internet is actually creating new opportunities for the publishing industry - but is it helping or just making things worse ? at the 54th frankfurt book fair , which runs from oct .
9-14 , the general atmosphere is one of foreboding and doom .
one of the key issues this year is the decline in annual book sales and the much-needed restructuring of the german publishing industry .
after years of growth , the industry is suffering its first real economic slump .
at first glance , advances in technology could be held partly responsible for this .
in fact , however , new media is giving a helping hand to the ailing publishing industry .
it is the single ray of light that has broken the gloom of the annual book fair .
originally , the internet was heralded as the death knell for the printed word .
a technological wonder that would make the need to search through dusty old book stores a thing of the past .
there , on shiny screens , would be the pages we once flicked through and whose corners we bent .
the internet was set to revolutionise literature .
and it has .
but not in the same way as many net boosters claimed it would .
each year technology buffs talk of the end of the book as we know it , even as printed and bound volumes continued to sell like hotcakes .
what has happened , however , is that the internet has become a rival to the conventional way we buy our books .
time to take advantage of technology , say publishers judging by the opinion of 45 per cent of german publishing houses , the time of cost-free internet bargains is over .
it is time to utilise the medium for the benefit of publishing while avoiding napster 's give-away philosophy , which some argue has crippled the music industry .
a boom in electronic media has seen the popularity of electronic , or e-books , improve dramatically .
around one million of these online versions of books , which can be downloaded for a fee , have been bought this year on the internet , hermann salmen , chief executive of the e-book publisher gemstar ebook told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
handheld ebooks , personal digital assistant-sized computers , have also become popular ways of receiving the manuscripts .
pda 's can carry over 4,000 pages of text or the equivalent of ten books .
it is an area of the book market that looks set to expand .
three-out-of-five publishing houses say that they want the percentage of their revenue from electronic books to increase to between five and 20 per cent in the next five years .
in most cases , it is currently less than five per cent , according to a survey recently conducted by the working group for electronic publishing of the german publishers and booksellers association .
around a fifth of publishers who currently produce electronic publications make a profit from the enterprise while a further 44 per cent break even , according to a report released at the book fair on wednesday by the same group .
still room for both markets to grow but far from becoming a deathmatch between tradition and technology , most of the big publishers agree there is plenty of room for both print and electronic publishing .
" the internet isn ’ t eating up books , it ’ s writing new ones , " matthias winter , manager of an internet encyclopaedia established by german publishing giant bertelsmann , told the news agency dpa . the company is currently showing off both its reference web site and its most recent print publication , a guide to the site that is already producing healthy sales at the frankfurt book fair .
online shopping has also provided the possibility of a new literary market , allowing those people who would not normally spend hours in a book shop to find the publications they want .
sales of books - the hard copy , real thing - have increased over the internet due to the ease with which literature can be found and paid for .
titles from all over the world have become available at the click of a button and all from the comfort of your own home .
the larger publishers and distributors have been quick to recognise the benefits .
online services have hit independent book shops hard however , it is not all good news as the gloomy atmosphere at the book fair testifies .
as a result of the increased popularity of e-books , online shopping and the advent of the book superstore , many independent bookshops have been forced to close .
with cheaper prices available from bulk stockists and online traders such as amazon , customers are choosing to make savings at the expense of the smaller outlets .
by 2005 , 10 percent of market is expected of publishing sales are expected to be conducted online , anderson forecasting has predicted .

a boom in electronic media has seen the popularity of electronic , or e-books , improve dramatically .
around one million of these online versions of books , which can be downloaded for a fee , have been bought this year on the internet , hermann salmen , chief executive of the e-book publisher gemstar ebook told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
handheld ebooks , personal digital assistant-sized computers , have also become popular ways of receiving the manuscripts .
pda 's can carry over 4,000 pages of text or the equivalent of ten books .
it is an area of the book market that looks set to expand .
three-out-of-five publishing houses say that they want the percentage of their revenue from electronic books to increase to between five and 20 per cent in the next five years .
in most cases , it is currently less than five per cent , according to a survey recently conducted by the working group for electronic publishing of the german publishers and booksellers association .
around a fifth of publishers who currently produce electronic publications make a profit from the enterprise while a further 44 per cent break even , according to a report released at the book fair on wednesday by the same group .
still room for both markets to grow but far from becoming a deathmatch between tradition and technology , most of the big publishers agree there is plenty of room for both print and electronic publishing .
" the internet isn ’ t eating up books , it ’ s writing new ones , " matthias winter , manager of an internet encyclopaedia established by german publishing giant bertelsmann , told the news agency dpa . the company is currently showing off both its reference web site and its most recent print publication , a guide to the site that is already producing healthy sales at the frankfurt book fair .
online shopping has also provided the possibility of a new literary market , allowing those people who would not normally spend hours in a book shop to find the publications they want .
sales of books - the hard copy , real thing - have increased over the internet due to the ease with which literature can be found and paid for .
titles from all over the world have become available at the click of a button and all from the comfort of your own home .
the larger publishers and distributors have been quick to recognise the benefits .
online services have hit independent book shops hard however , it is not all good news as the gloomy atmosphere at the book fair testifies .
as a result of the increased popularity of e-books , online shopping and the advent of the book superstore , many independent bookshops have been forced to close .
with cheaper prices available from bulk stockists and online traders such as amazon , customers are choosing to make savings at the expense of the smaller outlets .
by 2005 , 10 percent of market is expected of publishing sales are expected to be conducted online , anderson forecasting has predicted .
despite these current problems in the publishing industry , the increasing popularity of the internet and the opportunities it provides for the future means books , in whatever form , are set to be with us for a long time to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair every year the international book fair in frankfurt attracts thousands of visitors , exhibitors and authors from around the world .

key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .
" we have accused him of having been active in the group .
we have issued the arrest warrant on the firm suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization , " nehm told reporters after mzoudi was detained .
the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .
therefore , it is also very likely that mzoudi knew about the planned targets in the u.s.
" the accused knew the organization ’ s goals of launching terrorist attacks and supported it logistically , " nehm told the press .
the hamburg connection over the course of the last few years mzoudi shared a three-room apartment with atta and maintained close contact to al shehhi , binalshibh and said bahaji , another member of the terrorist cell still at large .
in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .
for years the young men going in and out of atta ’ s apartment went unnoticed by german authorities .
it wasn ’ t until events quickly began unfolding after last year ’ s attacks that authorities began to take a closer look at the activities of marienstraße 54 , and an entire terrorist network came to light .
profile of the accused rolf tophoven , a german expert on terrorism , said on dw-radio that the profile of mzoudi " exactly matches the profile of the whole group around mohammed atta .
they all had one thing in common : they received extensive training at camps in afghanistan .
obviously the accused had knowledge of the targets in the u.s. and probably also other selected targets in western europe . "
tophoven stressed that mzoudi and mounir el motassadeq , another suspected member of the hamburg al qaeda cell who goes on trial later this month , are only the tip of the iceberg .
when it comes to uncovering the terrorist network in germany , the authorities have only begin putting the pieces together , he said .
germany ’ s federal prosecutor admitted that investigations into the hamburg group had been difficult but also successful .

" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .

in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair opening a new chapter in the publishing industry book sales slump closing the book on small bookstores nigerian writer wins german peace prize culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.10.2002 new media cuts through the publishing gloom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quiet !
i 'm reading far from killing off the printed word , the internet is actually creating new opportunities for the publishing industry - but is it helping or just making things worse ? at the 54th frankfurt book fair , which runs from oct .
9-14 , the general atmosphere is one of foreboding and doom .
one of the key issues this year is the decline in annual book sales and the much-needed restructuring of the german publishing industry .
after years of growth , the industry is suffering its first real economic slump .
at first glance , advances in technology could be held partly responsible for this .
in fact , however , new media is giving a helping hand to the ailing publishing industry .
it is the single ray of light that has broken the gloom of the annual book fair .
originally , the internet was heralded as the death knell for the printed word .
a technological wonder that would make the need to search through dusty old book stores a thing of the past .
there , on shiny screens , would be the pages we once flicked through and whose corners we bent .
the internet was set to revolutionise literature .
and it has .
but not in the same way as many net boosters claimed it would .
each year technology buffs talk of the end of the book as we know it , even as printed and bound volumes continued to sell like hotcakes .
what has happened , however , is that the internet has become a rival to the conventional way we buy our books .
time to take advantage of technology , say publishers judging by the opinion of 45 per cent of german publishing houses , the time of cost-free internet bargains is over .
it is time to utilise the medium for the benefit of publishing while avoiding napster 's give-away philosophy , which some argue has crippled the music industry .
a boom in electronic media has seen the popularity of electronic , or e-books , improve dramatically .
around one million of these online versions of books , which can be downloaded for a fee , have been bought this year on the internet , hermann salmen , chief executive of the e-book publisher gemstar ebook told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
handheld ebooks , personal digital assistant-sized computers , have also become popular ways of receiving the manuscripts .
pda 's can carry over 4,000 pages of text or the equivalent of ten books .
it is an area of the book market that looks set to expand .
three-out-of-five publishing houses say that they want the percentage of their revenue from electronic books to increase to between five and 20 per cent in the next five years .
in most cases , it is currently less than five per cent , according to a survey recently conducted by the working group for electronic publishing of the german publishers and booksellers association .
around a fifth of publishers who currently produce electronic publications make a profit from the enterprise while a further 44 per cent break even , according to a report released at the book fair on wednesday by the same group .
still room for both markets to grow but far from becoming a deathmatch between tradition and technology , most of the big publishers agree there is plenty of room for both print and electronic publishing .
" the internet isn ’ t eating up books , it ’ s writing new ones , " matthias winter , manager of an internet encyclopaedia established by german publishing giant bertelsmann , told the news agency dpa . the company is currently showing off both its reference web site and its most recent print publication , a guide to the site that is already producing healthy sales at the frankfurt book fair .
online shopping has also provided the possibility of a new literary market , allowing those people who would not normally spend hours in a book shop to find the publications they want .
sales of books - the hard copy , real thing - have increased over the internet due to the ease with which literature can be found and paid for .
titles from all over the world have become available at the click of a button and all from the comfort of your own home .
the larger publishers and distributors have been quick to recognise the benefits .
online services have hit independent book shops hard however , it is not all good news as the gloomy atmosphere at the book fair testifies .
as a result of the increased popularity of e-books , online shopping and the advent of the book superstore , many independent bookshops have been forced to close .
with cheaper prices available from bulk stockists and online traders such as amazon , customers are choosing to make savings at the expense of the smaller outlets .
by 2005 , 10 percent of market is expected of publishing sales are expected to be conducted online , anderson forecasting has predicted .
despite these current problems in the publishing industry , the increasing popularity of the internet and the opportunities it provides for the future means books , in whatever form , are set to be with us for a long time to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair every year the international book fair in frankfurt attracts thousands of visitors , exhibitors and authors from around the world .

still room for both markets to grow but far from becoming a deathmatch between tradition and technology , most of the big publishers agree there is plenty of room for both print and electronic publishing .
" the internet isn ’ t eating up books , it ’ s writing new ones , " matthias winter , manager of an internet encyclopaedia established by german publishing giant bertelsmann , told the news agency dpa . the company is currently showing off both its reference web site and its most recent print publication , a guide to the site that is already producing healthy sales at the frankfurt book fair .
online shopping has also provided the possibility of a new literary market , allowing those people who would not normally spend hours in a book shop to find the publications they want .
sales of books - the hard copy , real thing - have increased over the internet due to the ease with which literature can be found and paid for .
titles from all over the world have become available at the click of a button and all from the comfort of your own home .
the larger publishers and distributors have been quick to recognise the benefits .
online services have hit independent book shops hard however , it is not all good news as the gloomy atmosphere at the book fair testifies .
as a result of the increased popularity of e-books , online shopping and the advent of the book superstore , many independent bookshops have been forced to close .
with cheaper prices available from bulk stockists and online traders such as amazon , customers are choosing to make savings at the expense of the smaller outlets .
by 2005 , 10 percent of market is expected of publishing sales are expected to be conducted online , anderson forecasting has predicted .
despite these current problems in the publishing industry , the increasing popularity of the internet and the opportunities it provides for the future means books , in whatever form , are set to be with us for a long time to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair every year the international book fair in frankfurt attracts thousands of visitors , exhibitors and authors from around the world .

"
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .
" the most important works were written after the war , in exile " , said german author marianna butenschön , an expert in lithuanian literature .
a new era the collapse of communism and lithuania 's successive independence in 1989 saw the start of a new era for lithuanian literature .
a new generation of authors appeared on the international literary stage – lithuanian authors returned after years in exile .
in addition , numerous translated manuscripts written by these writers in the years of lithuania 's occupation underwent yet another translation – this time back into their original language .

but his was not the only book published after 1989 that ignited controversy .
books which included the human body and the inner self , subjects that were for years taboo under the strict regime , were met with disgust , not least due to lithuania 's large catholic community .
however , the country 's young authors remained undeterred in their literary work .
" the young authors who began writing after the fall of communism are a lot more open when it comes to dealing with tradition and set forms , and also with their own bodies , " says ausrine jonikaite , lithuanian coordinator at the frankfurt book fair .

this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .
with the help of the frankfurt book fair , this easily overlooked country on europe 's eastern border hopes to attract more public awareness in western europe to its unique literary cultural landscape .
" to be continued " the motto " to be continued " is an allusion to " the frequent interruption of the development of the country by wars and occupation " , according to the organisers , and is a " reflection of the intention of the presentation : to concentrate on the contemporary scene , without forgetting it ’ s history . "
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .

i 'm reading far from killing off the printed word , the internet is actually creating new opportunities for the publishing industry - but is it helping or just making things worse ? at the 54th frankfurt book fair , which runs from oct .
9-14 , the general atmosphere is one of foreboding and doom .
one of the key issues this year is the decline in annual book sales and the much-needed restructuring of the german publishing industry .
after years of growth , the industry is suffering its first real economic slump .
at first glance , advances in technology could be held partly responsible for this .
in fact , however , new media is giving a helping hand to the ailing publishing industry .
it is the single ray of light that has broken the gloom of the annual book fair .
originally , the internet was heralded as the death knell for the printed word .
a technological wonder that would make the need to search through dusty old book stores a thing of the past .
there , on shiny screens , would be the pages we once flicked through and whose corners we bent .
the internet was set to revolutionise literature .
and it has .
but not in the same way as many net boosters claimed it would .
each year technology buffs talk of the end of the book as we know it , even as printed and bound volumes continued to sell like hotcakes .
what has happened , however , is that the internet has become a rival to the conventional way we buy our books .
time to take advantage of technology , say publishers judging by the opinion of 45 per cent of german publishing houses , the time of cost-free internet bargains is over .
it is time to utilise the medium for the benefit of publishing while avoiding napster 's give-away philosophy , which some argue has crippled the music industry .
a boom in electronic media has seen the popularity of electronic , or e-books , improve dramatically .
around one million of these online versions of books , which can be downloaded for a fee , have been bought this year on the internet , hermann salmen , chief executive of the e-book publisher gemstar ebook told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
handheld ebooks , personal digital assistant-sized computers , have also become popular ways of receiving the manuscripts .
pda 's can carry over 4,000 pages of text or the equivalent of ten books .
it is an area of the book market that looks set to expand .
three-out-of-five publishing houses say that they want the percentage of their revenue from electronic books to increase to between five and 20 per cent in the next five years .
in most cases , it is currently less than five per cent , according to a survey recently conducted by the working group for electronic publishing of the german publishers and booksellers association .
around a fifth of publishers who currently produce electronic publications make a profit from the enterprise while a further 44 per cent break even , according to a report released at the book fair on wednesday by the same group .
still room for both markets to grow but far from becoming a deathmatch between tradition and technology , most of the big publishers agree there is plenty of room for both print and electronic publishing .
" the internet isn ’ t eating up books , it ’ s writing new ones , " matthias winter , manager of an internet encyclopaedia established by german publishing giant bertelsmann , told the news agency dpa . the company is currently showing off both its reference web site and its most recent print publication , a guide to the site that is already producing healthy sales at the frankfurt book fair .
online shopping has also provided the possibility of a new literary market , allowing those people who would not normally spend hours in a book shop to find the publications they want .
sales of books - the hard copy , real thing - have increased over the internet due to the ease with which literature can be found and paid for .
titles from all over the world have become available at the click of a button and all from the comfort of your own home .
the larger publishers and distributors have been quick to recognise the benefits .
online services have hit independent book shops hard however , it is not all good news as the gloomy atmosphere at the book fair testifies .
as a result of the increased popularity of e-books , online shopping and the advent of the book superstore , many independent bookshops have been forced to close .
with cheaper prices available from bulk stockists and online traders such as amazon , customers are choosing to make savings at the expense of the smaller outlets .
by 2005 , 10 percent of market is expected of publishing sales are expected to be conducted online , anderson forecasting has predicted .
despite these current problems in the publishing industry , the increasing popularity of the internet and the opportunities it provides for the future means books , in whatever form , are set to be with us for a long time to come . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair every year the international book fair in frankfurt attracts thousands of visitors , exhibitors and authors from around the world .

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .
content of book likely to agitate catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldhagen holds the catholic church responsible for not protecting the jews .
some of the book 's core research material appeared as a 27,000-word essay in the american political magazine " the new republic " in january .
in the essay , goldhagen reiterates widely reported allegations that suggest that pius xii , the wartime pope , did not do enough to protect the jews , even though he likely knew of the fate which awaited them .
the vatican has always argued that its cautious , non-confrontational policy saved more people than would have been the case if it had spoken out in condemnation of the nazis .
goldhagen says such arguments are bizarre and nonsensical , topped only by those of revisionist historians , who try to argue the holocaust never actually happen .
goldhagen , a professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is no stranger to controversy or ruffling the feathers of germans .
his best-known book , hitler 's willing executioners , blamed ordinary germans for the holocaust .
although some critics accused him of taking liberties with the truth and writing in a confrontational style , the book became a best-seller and award winner . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .

i 'm reading far from killing off the printed word , the internet is actually creating new opportunities for the publishing industry - but is it helping or just making things worse ? at the 54th frankfurt book fair , which runs from oct .
9-14 , the general atmosphere is one of foreboding and doom .
one of the key issues this year is the decline in annual book sales and the much-needed restructuring of the german publishing industry .
after years of growth , the industry is suffering its first real economic slump .
at first glance , advances in technology could be held partly responsible for this .
in fact , however , new media is giving a helping hand to the ailing publishing industry .
it is the single ray of light that has broken the gloom of the annual book fair .

what has happened , however , is that the internet has become a rival to the conventional way we buy our books .

a boom in electronic media has seen the popularity of electronic , or e-books , improve dramatically .

pda 's can carry over 4,000 pages of text or the equivalent of ten books .
it is an area of the book market that looks set to expand .
three-out-of-five publishing houses say that they want the percentage of their revenue from electronic books to increase to between five and 20 per cent in the next five years .
in most cases , it is currently less than five per cent , according to a survey recently conducted by the working group for electronic publishing of the german publishers and booksellers association .
around a fifth of publishers who currently produce electronic publications make a profit from the enterprise while a further 44 per cent break even , according to a report released at the book fair on wednesday by the same group .

online shopping has also provided the possibility of a new literary market , allowing those people who would not normally spend hours in a book shop to find the publications they want .
sales of books - the hard copy , real thing - have increased over the internet due to the ease with which literature can be found and paid for .

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .
content of book likely to agitate catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldhagen holds the catholic church responsible for not protecting the jews .
some of the book 's core research material appeared as a 27,000-word essay in the american political magazine " the new republic " in january .
in the essay , goldhagen reiterates widely reported allegations that suggest that pius xii , the wartime pope , did not do enough to protect the jews , even though he likely knew of the fate which awaited them .
the vatican has always argued that its cautious , non-confrontational policy saved more people than would have been the case if it had spoken out in condemnation of the nazis .
goldhagen says such arguments are bizarre and nonsensical , topped only by those of revisionist historians , who try to argue the holocaust never actually happen .
goldhagen , a professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is no stranger to controversy or ruffling the feathers of germans .
his best-known book , hitler 's willing executioners , blamed ordinary germans for the holocaust .
although some critics accused him of taking liberties with the truth and writing in a confrontational style , the book became a best-seller and award winner . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .
" we have accused him of having been active in the group .
we have issued the arrest warrant on the firm suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization , " nehm told reporters after mzoudi was detained .
the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .
therefore , it is also very likely that mzoudi knew about the planned targets in the u.s.
" the accused knew the organization ’ s goals of launching terrorist attacks and supported it logistically , " nehm told the press .
the hamburg connection over the course of the last few years mzoudi shared a three-room apartment with atta and maintained close contact to al shehhi , binalshibh and said bahaji , another member of the terrorist cell still at large .
in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .
for years the young men going in and out of atta ’ s apartment went unnoticed by german authorities .
it wasn ’ t until events quickly began unfolding after last year ’ s attacks that authorities began to take a closer look at the activities of marienstraße 54 , and an entire terrorist network came to light .
profile of the accused rolf tophoven , a german expert on terrorism , said on dw-radio that the profile of mzoudi " exactly matches the profile of the whole group around mohammed atta .
they all had one thing in common : they received extensive training at camps in afghanistan .
obviously the accused had knowledge of the targets in the u.s. and probably also other selected targets in western europe . "
tophoven stressed that mzoudi and mounir el motassadeq , another suspected member of the hamburg al qaeda cell who goes on trial later this month , are only the tip of the iceberg .

i 'm reading far from killing off the printed word , the internet is actually creating new opportunities for the publishing industry - but is it helping or just making things worse ? at the 54th frankfurt book fair , which runs from oct .
9-14 , the general atmosphere is one of foreboding and doom .
one of the key issues this year is the decline in annual book sales and the much-needed restructuring of the german publishing industry .
after years of growth , the industry is suffering its first real economic slump .
at first glance , advances in technology could be held partly responsible for this .
in fact , however , new media is giving a helping hand to the ailing publishing industry .
it is the single ray of light that has broken the gloom of the annual book fair .
originally , the internet was heralded as the death knell for the printed word .
a technological wonder that would make the need to search through dusty old book stores a thing of the past .
there , on shiny screens , would be the pages we once flicked through and whose corners we bent .

each year technology buffs talk of the end of the book as we know it , even as printed and bound volumes continued to sell like hotcakes .
what has happened , however , is that the internet has become a rival to the conventional way we buy our books .
time to take advantage of technology , say publishers judging by the opinion of 45 per cent of german publishing houses , the time of cost-free internet bargains is over .
it is time to utilise the medium for the benefit of publishing while avoiding napster 's give-away philosophy , which some argue has crippled the music industry .
a boom in electronic media has seen the popularity of electronic , or e-books , improve dramatically .
around one million of these online versions of books , which can be downloaded for a fee , have been bought this year on the internet , hermann salmen , chief executive of the e-book publisher gemstar ebook told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .

three-out-of-five publishing houses say that they want the percentage of their revenue from electronic books to increase to between five and 20 per cent in the next five years .
in most cases , it is currently less than five per cent , according to a survey recently conducted by the working group for electronic publishing of the german publishers and booksellers association .

online shopping has also provided the possibility of a new literary market , allowing those people who would not normally spend hours in a book shop to find the publications they want .
sales of books - the hard copy , real thing - have increased over the internet due to the ease with which literature can be found and paid for .
titles from all over the world have become available at the click of a button and all from the comfort of your own home .
the larger publishers and distributors have been quick to recognise the benefits .
online services have hit independent book shops hard however , it is not all good news as the gloomy atmosphere at the book fair testifies .
as a result of the increased popularity of e-books , online shopping and the advent of the book superstore , many independent bookshops have been forced to close .
with cheaper prices available from bulk stockists and online traders such as amazon , customers are choosing to make savings at the expense of the smaller outlets .
by 2005 , 10 percent of market is expected of publishing sales are expected to be conducted online , anderson forecasting has predicted .

i 'm reading far from killing off the printed word , the internet is actually creating new opportunities for the publishing industry - but is it helping or just making things worse ? at the 54th frankfurt book fair , which runs from oct .
9-14 , the general atmosphere is one of foreboding and doom .
one of the key issues this year is the decline in annual book sales and the much-needed restructuring of the german publishing industry .
after years of growth , the industry is suffering its first real economic slump .
at first glance , advances in technology could be held partly responsible for this .
in fact , however , new media is giving a helping hand to the ailing publishing industry .
it is the single ray of light that has broken the gloom of the annual book fair .
originally , the internet was heralded as the death knell for the printed word .
a technological wonder that would make the need to search through dusty old book stores a thing of the past .
there , on shiny screens , would be the pages we once flicked through and whose corners we bent .
the internet was set to revolutionise literature .
and it has .
but not in the same way as many net boosters claimed it would .
each year technology buffs talk of the end of the book as we know it , even as printed and bound volumes continued to sell like hotcakes .
what has happened , however , is that the internet has become a rival to the conventional way we buy our books .
time to take advantage of technology , say publishers judging by the opinion of 45 per cent of german publishing houses , the time of cost-free internet bargains is over .
it is time to utilise the medium for the benefit of publishing while avoiding napster 's give-away philosophy , which some argue has crippled the music industry .
a boom in electronic media has seen the popularity of electronic , or e-books , improve dramatically .
around one million of these online versions of books , which can be downloaded for a fee , have been bought this year on the internet , hermann salmen , chief executive of the e-book publisher gemstar ebook told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
handheld ebooks , personal digital assistant-sized computers , have also become popular ways of receiving the manuscripts .
pda 's can carry over 4,000 pages of text or the equivalent of ten books .
it is an area of the book market that looks set to expand .
three-out-of-five publishing houses say that they want the percentage of their revenue from electronic books to increase to between five and 20 per cent in the next five years .
in most cases , it is currently less than five per cent , according to a survey recently conducted by the working group for electronic publishing of the german publishers and booksellers association .
around a fifth of publishers who currently produce electronic publications make a profit from the enterprise while a further 44 per cent break even , according to a report released at the book fair on wednesday by the same group .

this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .
with the help of the frankfurt book fair , this easily overlooked country on europe 's eastern border hopes to attract more public awareness in western europe to its unique literary cultural landscape .
" to be continued " the motto " to be continued " is an allusion to " the frequent interruption of the development of the country by wars and occupation " , according to the organisers , and is a " reflection of the intention of the presentation : to concentrate on the contemporary scene , without forgetting it ’ s history . "
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .
" the most important works were written after the war , in exile " , said german author marianna butenschön , an expert in lithuanian literature .
a new era the collapse of communism and lithuania 's successive independence in 1989 saw the start of a new era for lithuanian literature .
a new generation of authors appeared on the international literary stage – lithuanian authors returned after years in exile .
in addition , numerous translated manuscripts written by these writers in the years of lithuania 's occupation underwent yet another translation – this time back into their original language .
one author who experienced these changes is ricardas gavelis , who published his novel vilna poker in 1989 , a book which he had completed two years before publication .
too much human flesh gavelis ' book , which protested both against the russian regime and against the supporting powers in lithuania , was met with controversy his own home country , especially among those who felt the need to protect their former life under communism and lithuanian traditions .
but his was not the only book published after 1989 that ignited controversy .
books which included the human body and the inner self , subjects that were for years taboo under the strict regime , were met with disgust , not least due to lithuania 's large catholic community .
however , the country 's young authors remained undeterred in their literary work .

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .
content of book likely to agitate catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldhagen holds the catholic church responsible for not protecting the jews .
some of the book 's core research material appeared as a 27,000-word essay in the american political magazine " the new republic " in january .
in the essay , goldhagen reiterates widely reported allegations that suggest that pius xii , the wartime pope , did not do enough to protect the jews , even though he likely knew of the fate which awaited them .
the vatican has always argued that its cautious , non-confrontational policy saved more people than would have been the case if it had spoken out in condemnation of the nazis .
goldhagen says such arguments are bizarre and nonsensical , topped only by those of revisionist historians , who try to argue the holocaust never actually happen .
goldhagen , a professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is no stranger to controversy or ruffling the feathers of germans .
his best-known book , hitler 's willing executioners , blamed ordinary germans for the holocaust .
although some critics accused him of taking liberties with the truth and writing in a confrontational style , the book became a best-seller and award winner . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : frankfurt book fair opening a new chapter in the publishing industry book sales slump closing the book on small bookstores nigerian writer wins german peace prize culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.10.2002 lithuanian authors feted at book fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is much to discover about lithuania 's literature at the frankfurt book fair although it 's located at the geographical centre of europe , many still see lithuania as part of the east .
this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .
with the help of the frankfurt book fair , this easily overlooked country on europe 's eastern border hopes to attract more public awareness in western europe to its unique literary cultural landscape .
" to be continued " the motto " to be continued " is an allusion to " the frequent interruption of the development of the country by wars and occupation " , according to the organisers , and is a " reflection of the intention of the presentation : to concentrate on the contemporary scene , without forgetting it ’ s history . "
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .
" the most important works were written after the war , in exile " , said german author marianna butenschön , an expert in lithuanian literature .
a new era the collapse of communism and lithuania 's successive independence in 1989 saw the start of a new era for lithuanian literature .
a new generation of authors appeared on the international literary stage – lithuanian authors returned after years in exile .
in addition , numerous translated manuscripts written by these writers in the years of lithuania 's occupation underwent yet another translation – this time back into their original language .
one author who experienced these changes is ricardas gavelis , who published his novel vilna poker in 1989 , a book which he had completed two years before publication .
too much human flesh gavelis ' book , which protested both against the russian regime and against the supporting powers in lithuania , was met with controversy his own home country , especially among those who felt the need to protect their former life under communism and lithuanian traditions .
but his was not the only book published after 1989 that ignited controversy .
books which included the human body and the inner self , subjects that were for years taboo under the strict regime , were met with disgust , not least due to lithuania 's large catholic community .
however , the country 's young authors remained undeterred in their literary work .
" the young authors who began writing after the fall of communism are a lot more open when it comes to dealing with tradition and set forms , and also with their own bodies , " says ausrine jonikaite , lithuanian coordinator at the frankfurt book fair .
banned books in 1993 , 39-year-old jurga ivanauskaite 's book rain witch was banned .
a love story told by three women - a modern-day bohemian outsider , a medieval witch and mary magdalene - it was immediately condemned in official circles as pornography .
jurga ivanauskaite resolved to leave the country .
ironically , she is today one of the country 's most well known writers of lithuanian contemporary literature .
struggling literary scene ivanauskaite is one of 26 lithuanian authors taking part in the frankfurt book fair .
but their presence can not hide the fact that authors from this country can still not survive from writing alone , and that lithuania is still struggling to establish a professional literary scene .
sales are , in comparison to former communist times , low , and not one of the 300 registered authors can compete with western literature .

key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .
" we have accused him of having been active in the group .
we have issued the arrest warrant on the firm suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization , " nehm told reporters after mzoudi was detained .
the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .

in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .

christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .
content of book likely to agitate catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldhagen holds the catholic church responsible for not protecting the jews .
some of the book 's core research material appeared as a 27,000-word essay in the american political magazine " the new republic " in january .
in the essay , goldhagen reiterates widely reported allegations that suggest that pius xii , the wartime pope , did not do enough to protect the jews , even though he likely knew of the fate which awaited them .
the vatican has always argued that its cautious , non-confrontational policy saved more people than would have been the case if it had spoken out in condemnation of the nazis .
goldhagen says such arguments are bizarre and nonsensical , topped only by those of revisionist historians , who try to argue the holocaust never actually happen .
goldhagen , a professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is no stranger to controversy or ruffling the feathers of germans .
his best-known book , hitler 's willing executioners , blamed ordinary germans for the holocaust .

this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .

" to be continued " the motto " to be continued " is an allusion to " the frequent interruption of the development of the country by wars and occupation " , according to the organisers , and is a " reflection of the intention of the presentation : to concentrate on the contemporary scene , without forgetting it ’ s history . "
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .
" the most important works were written after the war , in exile " , said german author marianna butenschön , an expert in lithuanian literature .
a new era the collapse of communism and lithuania 's successive independence in 1989 saw the start of a new era for lithuanian literature .
a new generation of authors appeared on the international literary stage – lithuanian authors returned after years in exile .
in addition , numerous translated manuscripts written by these writers in the years of lithuania 's occupation underwent yet another translation – this time back into their original language .
one author who experienced these changes is ricardas gavelis , who published his novel vilna poker in 1989 , a book which he had completed two years before publication .
too much human flesh gavelis ' book , which protested both against the russian regime and against the supporting powers in lithuania , was met with controversy his own home country , especially among those who felt the need to protect their former life under communism and lithuanian traditions .
but his was not the only book published after 1989 that ignited controversy .
books which included the human body and the inner self , subjects that were for years taboo under the strict regime , were met with disgust , not least due to lithuania 's large catholic community .
however , the country 's young authors remained undeterred in their literary work .
" the young authors who began writing after the fall of communism are a lot more open when it comes to dealing with tradition and set forms , and also with their own bodies , " says ausrine jonikaite , lithuanian coordinator at the frankfurt book fair .

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .

" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.10.2002 germany arrests terrorist helper großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi is escorted by two german police officers 13 months after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , german authorities have succeeded in arresting a man suspected of assisting the hamburg-based al qaeda cell . early thursday morning , police in the german city of hamburg arrested a 29-year old moroccan man believed to have connections to the al qaeda cell of hijackers responsible for the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .
" we have accused him of having been active in the group .
we have issued the arrest warrant on the firm suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization , " nehm told reporters after mzoudi was detained .
the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .
therefore , it is also very likely that mzoudi knew about the planned targets in the u.s.
" the accused knew the organization ’ s goals of launching terrorist attacks and supported it logistically , " nehm told the press .
the hamburg connection over the course of the last few years mzoudi shared a three-room apartment with atta and maintained close contact to al shehhi , binalshibh and said bahaji , another member of the terrorist cell still at large .
in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .
for years the young men going in and out of atta ’ s apartment went unnoticed by german authorities .
it wasn ’ t until events quickly began unfolding after last year ’ s attacks that authorities began to take a closer look at the activities of marienstraße 54 , and an entire terrorist network came to light .
profile of the accused rolf tophoven , a german expert on terrorism , said on dw-radio that the profile of mzoudi " exactly matches the profile of the whole group around mohammed atta .
they all had one thing in common : they received extensive training at camps in afghanistan .
obviously the accused had knowledge of the targets in the u.s. and probably also other selected targets in western europe . "
tophoven stressed that mzoudi and mounir el motassadeq , another suspected member of the hamburg al qaeda cell who goes on trial later this month , are only the tip of the iceberg .
when it comes to uncovering the terrorist network in germany , the authorities have only begin putting the pieces together , he said .
germany ’ s federal prosecutor admitted that investigations into the hamburg group had been difficult but also successful .
" what we have achieved so far is excellent in international comparison .
no other country has come this far , " nehm told reporters .
on friday mzoudi will be brought before an investigating judge of the federal supreme court in karlsruhe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany the past year has been an illuminating one for german anti-terrorism investigators .

for four years fereshta ludin , a muslim woman from stuttgart , has been trying to convince german courts of her right to wear a headscarf while teaching .
now the federal administrative court has made a landmark decision . it was not a question of fashion , whether fereshta ludin , a 30-year-old muslim woman living in germany , could wear her headscarf while teaching class at a public school .
in 1998 , the board of education in the federal state of baden-württemberg rejected ludin ’ s application to become a teacher on the grounds that her headscarf , which ludin insisted on wearing to school during her internship , was a symbol of the islamic faith .
since then , the afghan woman from the city of stuttgart has appealed to several german courts , first on the municipal , then on the state level .
and she lost every case .
in what has become a landmark decision , the german federal administrative court in berlin ruled on thursday that teachers at public schools must refrain from openly displaying religious symbols in class , since they are representatives of the state and function as role models for their students .
religious freedom yes , but for whom ?
according to the koran , muslim women are told to wear a veil called a " hijab " to shield them from the eyes of men outside their family .
while the tradition is a basic part of daily life in islamic countries , including saudi-arabia and afghanistan , many muslim women living in the west have abandoned the practice .
others , like fereshta ludin , have taken the custom to their new home countries , where laws protecting the freedom of religion permit them to dress according to their beliefs .
in the current case , however , the judges overruled fereshta ludin ’ s private religious rights in favor of that of her students ’ rights to secular education .
the courts ruled that a teacher appearing before a class is a representative of the state , and should not appear as a private person endorsing a particular religious belief .
" the officeholder -lrb- of teacher -rrb- should not demonstrate private interests , but rather uphold those of the state , " the judge said .
in the interest of pupils as a legal basis , the judges cite the so-called " negative freedom of religion " act , which states that pupils must not be confronted with religious symbols against their will .
as the presiding judge in the berlin court told the press , the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom requires that pupils be protected from the state ’ s influence of religions foreign to them – also in the form of a symbol .
the pupils must not be forced to endure exposure to any religion without the chance to withdraw from it , the judge said .
the court ruled that pupils attending elementary and secondary school , where ludin wanted to teach , are still developing their personalities and that teachers have a decisive influence on their development as role models .
a history of debate religious icons were also a subject of a court ruling in 1995 by the country ’ s highest legislative body , the federal constitutional court in the city of karlsruhe .
at the time , judges declared that it was unconstitutional for state education laws in bavaria to make crucifixes prescriptive for classrooms throughout the state .
since such a measure would imply that the state openly takes sides for a distinct faith , this would violate the rights of pupils to freely choose which symbols they look at .
walking a tight line this time , the judges of the german federal court had to walk a tight line in reaching a decision that did not alienate the muslim community in germany .
for this reason , the verdict is left intentionally open and applies to symbols of any religion , not only those of muslims .
" the prohibiting of religious symbols must apply to all religious symbols , without exception , " the head judge in the baden-württemberg case said four years ago .
teachers now fear that the judgement will have far-reaching consequences , as it could theoretically apply to christian crosses worn on a necklace .
because of the decision , teachers can no longer argue that they wear a cross merely for private reasons , since fereshta ludin had used the same line of argumentation in defending her headscarf .
harsh criticism despite its efforts to maintain neutrality , the court ’ s decision sparked outrage among muslims living in germany .
the speaker of the central committee of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , aiman mazyek , told the german daily " stuttgarter nachrichten " that the verdict practically bans muslim women , who wear traditional headscarves , from working as teachers .
further , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
in a contrary position , the head of the turkish congregation in germany , hakki keskin , told the paper he found the decision appropriate , since a headscarf is indeed symbolic in character as it expresses a certain direction of faith .
ferashta ludin is now likely to take her case to germany ’ s highest court , the federal constitutional court .
and it looks like she has gained some supporters - those teachers who want to keep their crosses on their necklace . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

for four years fereshta ludin , a muslim woman from stuttgart , has been trying to convince german courts of her right to wear a headscarf while teaching .
now the federal administrative court has made a landmark decision . it was not a question of fashion , whether fereshta ludin , a 30-year-old muslim woman living in germany , could wear her headscarf while teaching class at a public school .
in 1998 , the board of education in the federal state of baden-württemberg rejected ludin ’ s application to become a teacher on the grounds that her headscarf , which ludin insisted on wearing to school during her internship , was a symbol of the islamic faith .
since then , the afghan woman from the city of stuttgart has appealed to several german courts , first on the municipal , then on the state level .
and she lost every case .
in what has become a landmark decision , the german federal administrative court in berlin ruled on thursday that teachers at public schools must refrain from openly displaying religious symbols in class , since they are representatives of the state and function as role models for their students .
religious freedom yes , but for whom ?
according to the koran , muslim women are told to wear a veil called a " hijab " to shield them from the eyes of men outside their family .
while the tradition is a basic part of daily life in islamic countries , including saudi-arabia and afghanistan , many muslim women living in the west have abandoned the practice .
others , like fereshta ludin , have taken the custom to their new home countries , where laws protecting the freedom of religion permit them to dress according to their beliefs .
in the current case , however , the judges overruled fereshta ludin ’ s private religious rights in favor of that of her students ’ rights to secular education .
the courts ruled that a teacher appearing before a class is a representative of the state , and should not appear as a private person endorsing a particular religious belief .
" the officeholder -lrb- of teacher -rrb- should not demonstrate private interests , but rather uphold those of the state , " the judge said .
in the interest of pupils as a legal basis , the judges cite the so-called " negative freedom of religion " act , which states that pupils must not be confronted with religious symbols against their will .
as the presiding judge in the berlin court told the press , the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom requires that pupils be protected from the state ’ s influence of religions foreign to them – also in the form of a symbol .
the pupils must not be forced to endure exposure to any religion without the chance to withdraw from it , the judge said .
the court ruled that pupils attending elementary and secondary school , where ludin wanted to teach , are still developing their personalities and that teachers have a decisive influence on their development as role models .
a history of debate religious icons were also a subject of a court ruling in 1995 by the country ’ s highest legislative body , the federal constitutional court in the city of karlsruhe .
at the time , judges declared that it was unconstitutional for state education laws in bavaria to make crucifixes prescriptive for classrooms throughout the state .
since such a measure would imply that the state openly takes sides for a distinct faith , this would violate the rights of pupils to freely choose which symbols they look at .
walking a tight line this time , the judges of the german federal court had to walk a tight line in reaching a decision that did not alienate the muslim community in germany .
for this reason , the verdict is left intentionally open and applies to symbols of any religion , not only those of muslims .
" the prohibiting of religious symbols must apply to all religious symbols , without exception , " the head judge in the baden-württemberg case said four years ago .
teachers now fear that the judgement will have far-reaching consequences , as it could theoretically apply to christian crosses worn on a necklace .
because of the decision , teachers can no longer argue that they wear a cross merely for private reasons , since fereshta ludin had used the same line of argumentation in defending her headscarf .

for four years fereshta ludin , a muslim woman from stuttgart , has been trying to convince german courts of her right to wear a headscarf while teaching .
now the federal administrative court has made a landmark decision . it was not a question of fashion , whether fereshta ludin , a 30-year-old muslim woman living in germany , could wear her headscarf while teaching class at a public school .
in 1998 , the board of education in the federal state of baden-württemberg rejected ludin ’ s application to become a teacher on the grounds that her headscarf , which ludin insisted on wearing to school during her internship , was a symbol of the islamic faith .
since then , the afghan woman from the city of stuttgart has appealed to several german courts , first on the municipal , then on the state level .
and she lost every case .
in what has become a landmark decision , the german federal administrative court in berlin ruled on thursday that teachers at public schools must refrain from openly displaying religious symbols in class , since they are representatives of the state and function as role models for their students .
religious freedom yes , but for whom ?
according to the koran , muslim women are told to wear a veil called a " hijab " to shield them from the eyes of men outside their family .
while the tradition is a basic part of daily life in islamic countries , including saudi-arabia and afghanistan , many muslim women living in the west have abandoned the practice .
others , like fereshta ludin , have taken the custom to their new home countries , where laws protecting the freedom of religion permit them to dress according to their beliefs .
in the current case , however , the judges overruled fereshta ludin ’ s private religious rights in favor of that of her students ’ rights to secular education .
the courts ruled that a teacher appearing before a class is a representative of the state , and should not appear as a private person endorsing a particular religious belief .
" the officeholder -lrb- of teacher -rrb- should not demonstrate private interests , but rather uphold those of the state , " the judge said .
in the interest of pupils as a legal basis , the judges cite the so-called " negative freedom of religion " act , which states that pupils must not be confronted with religious symbols against their will .
as the presiding judge in the berlin court told the press , the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom requires that pupils be protected from the state ’ s influence of religions foreign to them – also in the form of a symbol .
the pupils must not be forced to endure exposure to any religion without the chance to withdraw from it , the judge said .
the court ruled that pupils attending elementary and secondary school , where ludin wanted to teach , are still developing their personalities and that teachers have a decisive influence on their development as role models .
a history of debate religious icons were also a subject of a court ruling in 1995 by the country ’ s highest legislative body , the federal constitutional court in the city of karlsruhe .
at the time , judges declared that it was unconstitutional for state education laws in bavaria to make crucifixes prescriptive for classrooms throughout the state .
since such a measure would imply that the state openly takes sides for a distinct faith , this would violate the rights of pupils to freely choose which symbols they look at .
walking a tight line this time , the judges of the german federal court had to walk a tight line in reaching a decision that did not alienate the muslim community in germany .
for this reason , the verdict is left intentionally open and applies to symbols of any religion , not only those of muslims .
" the prohibiting of religious symbols must apply to all religious symbols , without exception , " the head judge in the baden-württemberg case said four years ago .
teachers now fear that the judgement will have far-reaching consequences , as it could theoretically apply to christian crosses worn on a necklace .
because of the decision , teachers can no longer argue that they wear a cross merely for private reasons , since fereshta ludin had used the same line of argumentation in defending her headscarf .
harsh criticism despite its efforts to maintain neutrality , the court ’ s decision sparked outrage among muslims living in germany .
the speaker of the central committee of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , aiman mazyek , told the german daily " stuttgarter nachrichten " that the verdict practically bans muslim women , who wear traditional headscarves , from working as teachers .
further , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
in a contrary position , the head of the turkish congregation in germany , hakki keskin , told the paper he found the decision appropriate , since a headscarf is indeed symbolic in character as it expresses a certain direction of faith .

for four years fereshta ludin , a muslim woman from stuttgart , has been trying to convince german courts of her right to wear a headscarf while teaching .
now the federal administrative court has made a landmark decision . it was not a question of fashion , whether fereshta ludin , a 30-year-old muslim woman living in germany , could wear her headscarf while teaching class at a public school .
in 1998 , the board of education in the federal state of baden-württemberg rejected ludin ’ s application to become a teacher on the grounds that her headscarf , which ludin insisted on wearing to school during her internship , was a symbol of the islamic faith .
since then , the afghan woman from the city of stuttgart has appealed to several german courts , first on the municipal , then on the state level .
and she lost every case .
in what has become a landmark decision , the german federal administrative court in berlin ruled on thursday that teachers at public schools must refrain from openly displaying religious symbols in class , since they are representatives of the state and function as role models for their students .
religious freedom yes , but for whom ?
according to the koran , muslim women are told to wear a veil called a " hijab " to shield them from the eyes of men outside their family .
while the tradition is a basic part of daily life in islamic countries , including saudi-arabia and afghanistan , many muslim women living in the west have abandoned the practice .
others , like fereshta ludin , have taken the custom to their new home countries , where laws protecting the freedom of religion permit them to dress according to their beliefs .
in the current case , however , the judges overruled fereshta ludin ’ s private religious rights in favor of that of her students ’ rights to secular education .
the courts ruled that a teacher appearing before a class is a representative of the state , and should not appear as a private person endorsing a particular religious belief .
" the officeholder -lrb- of teacher -rrb- should not demonstrate private interests , but rather uphold those of the state , " the judge said .
in the interest of pupils as a legal basis , the judges cite the so-called " negative freedom of religion " act , which states that pupils must not be confronted with religious symbols against their will .
as the presiding judge in the berlin court told the press , the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom requires that pupils be protected from the state ’ s influence of religions foreign to them – also in the form of a symbol .
the pupils must not be forced to endure exposure to any religion without the chance to withdraw from it , the judge said .
the court ruled that pupils attending elementary and secondary school , where ludin wanted to teach , are still developing their personalities and that teachers have a decisive influence on their development as role models .
a history of debate religious icons were also a subject of a court ruling in 1995 by the country ’ s highest legislative body , the federal constitutional court in the city of karlsruhe .
at the time , judges declared that it was unconstitutional for state education laws in bavaria to make crucifixes prescriptive for classrooms throughout the state .
since such a measure would imply that the state openly takes sides for a distinct faith , this would violate the rights of pupils to freely choose which symbols they look at .
walking a tight line this time , the judges of the german federal court had to walk a tight line in reaching a decision that did not alienate the muslim community in germany .
for this reason , the verdict is left intentionally open and applies to symbols of any religion , not only those of muslims .
" the prohibiting of religious symbols must apply to all religious symbols , without exception , " the head judge in the baden-württemberg case said four years ago .
teachers now fear that the judgement will have far-reaching consequences , as it could theoretically apply to christian crosses worn on a necklace .
because of the decision , teachers can no longer argue that they wear a cross merely for private reasons , since fereshta ludin had used the same line of argumentation in defending her headscarf .
harsh criticism despite its efforts to maintain neutrality , the court ’ s decision sparked outrage among muslims living in germany .
the speaker of the central committee of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , aiman mazyek , told the german daily " stuttgarter nachrichten " that the verdict practically bans muslim women , who wear traditional headscarves , from working as teachers .
further , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
in a contrary position , the head of the turkish congregation in germany , hakki keskin , told the paper he found the decision appropriate , since a headscarf is indeed symbolic in character as it expresses a certain direction of faith .

for four years fereshta ludin , a muslim woman from stuttgart , has been trying to convince german courts of her right to wear a headscarf while teaching .
now the federal administrative court has made a landmark decision . it was not a question of fashion , whether fereshta ludin , a 30-year-old muslim woman living in germany , could wear her headscarf while teaching class at a public school .
in 1998 , the board of education in the federal state of baden-württemberg rejected ludin ’ s application to become a teacher on the grounds that her headscarf , which ludin insisted on wearing to school during her internship , was a symbol of the islamic faith .
since then , the afghan woman from the city of stuttgart has appealed to several german courts , first on the municipal , then on the state level .
and she lost every case .
in what has become a landmark decision , the german federal administrative court in berlin ruled on thursday that teachers at public schools must refrain from openly displaying religious symbols in class , since they are representatives of the state and function as role models for their students .
religious freedom yes , but for whom ?
according to the koran , muslim women are told to wear a veil called a " hijab " to shield them from the eyes of men outside their family .
while the tradition is a basic part of daily life in islamic countries , including saudi-arabia and afghanistan , many muslim women living in the west have abandoned the practice .
others , like fereshta ludin , have taken the custom to their new home countries , where laws protecting the freedom of religion permit them to dress according to their beliefs .
in the current case , however , the judges overruled fereshta ludin ’ s private religious rights in favor of that of her students ’ rights to secular education .
the courts ruled that a teacher appearing before a class is a representative of the state , and should not appear as a private person endorsing a particular religious belief .
" the officeholder -lrb- of teacher -rrb- should not demonstrate private interests , but rather uphold those of the state , " the judge said .
in the interest of pupils as a legal basis , the judges cite the so-called " negative freedom of religion " act , which states that pupils must not be confronted with religious symbols against their will .
as the presiding judge in the berlin court told the press , the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom requires that pupils be protected from the state ’ s influence of religions foreign to them – also in the form of a symbol .
the pupils must not be forced to endure exposure to any religion without the chance to withdraw from it , the judge said .
the court ruled that pupils attending elementary and secondary school , where ludin wanted to teach , are still developing their personalities and that teachers have a decisive influence on their development as role models .
a history of debate religious icons were also a subject of a court ruling in 1995 by the country ’ s highest legislative body , the federal constitutional court in the city of karlsruhe .
at the time , judges declared that it was unconstitutional for state education laws in bavaria to make crucifixes prescriptive for classrooms throughout the state .
since such a measure would imply that the state openly takes sides for a distinct faith , this would violate the rights of pupils to freely choose which symbols they look at .
walking a tight line this time , the judges of the german federal court had to walk a tight line in reaching a decision that did not alienate the muslim community in germany .
for this reason , the verdict is left intentionally open and applies to symbols of any religion , not only those of muslims .
" the prohibiting of religious symbols must apply to all religious symbols , without exception , " the head judge in the baden-württemberg case said four years ago .
teachers now fear that the judgement will have far-reaching consequences , as it could theoretically apply to christian crosses worn on a necklace .
because of the decision , teachers can no longer argue that they wear a cross merely for private reasons , since fereshta ludin had used the same line of argumentation in defending her headscarf .
harsh criticism despite its efforts to maintain neutrality , the court ’ s decision sparked outrage among muslims living in germany .
the speaker of the central committee of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , aiman mazyek , told the german daily " stuttgarter nachrichten " that the verdict practically bans muslim women , who wear traditional headscarves , from working as teachers .
further , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
in a contrary position , the head of the turkish congregation in germany , hakki keskin , told the paper he found the decision appropriate , since a headscarf is indeed symbolic in character as it expresses a certain direction of faith .
ferashta ludin is now likely to take her case to germany ’ s highest court , the federal constitutional court .
and it looks like she has gained some supporters - those teachers who want to keep their crosses on their necklace . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

for four years fereshta ludin , a muslim woman from stuttgart , has been trying to convince german courts of her right to wear a headscarf while teaching .
now the federal administrative court has made a landmark decision . it was not a question of fashion , whether fereshta ludin , a 30-year-old muslim woman living in germany , could wear her headscarf while teaching class at a public school .
in 1998 , the board of education in the federal state of baden-württemberg rejected ludin ’ s application to become a teacher on the grounds that her headscarf , which ludin insisted on wearing to school during her internship , was a symbol of the islamic faith .
since then , the afghan woman from the city of stuttgart has appealed to several german courts , first on the municipal , then on the state level .
and she lost every case .
in what has become a landmark decision , the german federal administrative court in berlin ruled on thursday that teachers at public schools must refrain from openly displaying religious symbols in class , since they are representatives of the state and function as role models for their students .
religious freedom yes , but for whom ?
according to the koran , muslim women are told to wear a veil called a " hijab " to shield them from the eyes of men outside their family .
while the tradition is a basic part of daily life in islamic countries , including saudi-arabia and afghanistan , many muslim women living in the west have abandoned the practice .
others , like fereshta ludin , have taken the custom to their new home countries , where laws protecting the freedom of religion permit them to dress according to their beliefs .
in the current case , however , the judges overruled fereshta ludin ’ s private religious rights in favor of that of her students ’ rights to secular education .
the courts ruled that a teacher appearing before a class is a representative of the state , and should not appear as a private person endorsing a particular religious belief .
" the officeholder -lrb- of teacher -rrb- should not demonstrate private interests , but rather uphold those of the state , " the judge said .
in the interest of pupils as a legal basis , the judges cite the so-called " negative freedom of religion " act , which states that pupils must not be confronted with religious symbols against their will .
as the presiding judge in the berlin court told the press , the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom requires that pupils be protected from the state ’ s influence of religions foreign to them – also in the form of a symbol .
the pupils must not be forced to endure exposure to any religion without the chance to withdraw from it , the judge said .
the court ruled that pupils attending elementary and secondary school , where ludin wanted to teach , are still developing their personalities and that teachers have a decisive influence on their development as role models .
a history of debate religious icons were also a subject of a court ruling in 1995 by the country ’ s highest legislative body , the federal constitutional court in the city of karlsruhe .
at the time , judges declared that it was unconstitutional for state education laws in bavaria to make crucifixes prescriptive for classrooms throughout the state .
since such a measure would imply that the state openly takes sides for a distinct faith , this would violate the rights of pupils to freely choose which symbols they look at .
walking a tight line this time , the judges of the german federal court had to walk a tight line in reaching a decision that did not alienate the muslim community in germany .
for this reason , the verdict is left intentionally open and applies to symbols of any religion , not only those of muslims .
" the prohibiting of religious symbols must apply to all religious symbols , without exception , " the head judge in the baden-württemberg case said four years ago .
teachers now fear that the judgement will have far-reaching consequences , as it could theoretically apply to christian crosses worn on a necklace .
because of the decision , teachers can no longer argue that they wear a cross merely for private reasons , since fereshta ludin had used the same line of argumentation in defending her headscarf .
harsh criticism despite its efforts to maintain neutrality , the court ’ s decision sparked outrage among muslims living in germany .
the speaker of the central committee of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , aiman mazyek , told the german daily " stuttgarter nachrichten " that the verdict practically bans muslim women , who wear traditional headscarves , from working as teachers .
further , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
in a contrary position , the head of the turkish congregation in germany , hakki keskin , told the paper he found the decision appropriate , since a headscarf is indeed symbolic in character as it expresses a certain direction of faith .
ferashta ludin is now likely to take her case to germany ’ s highest court , the federal constitutional court .
and it looks like she has gained some supporters - those teachers who want to keep their crosses on their necklace . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

for four years fereshta ludin , a muslim woman from stuttgart , has been trying to convince german courts of her right to wear a headscarf while teaching .
now the federal administrative court has made a landmark decision . it was not a question of fashion , whether fereshta ludin , a 30-year-old muslim woman living in germany , could wear her headscarf while teaching class at a public school .
in 1998 , the board of education in the federal state of baden-württemberg rejected ludin ’ s application to become a teacher on the grounds that her headscarf , which ludin insisted on wearing to school during her internship , was a symbol of the islamic faith .
since then , the afghan woman from the city of stuttgart has appealed to several german courts , first on the municipal , then on the state level .
and she lost every case .
in what has become a landmark decision , the german federal administrative court in berlin ruled on thursday that teachers at public schools must refrain from openly displaying religious symbols in class , since they are representatives of the state and function as role models for their students .
religious freedom yes , but for whom ?
according to the koran , muslim women are told to wear a veil called a " hijab " to shield them from the eyes of men outside their family .
while the tradition is a basic part of daily life in islamic countries , including saudi-arabia and afghanistan , many muslim women living in the west have abandoned the practice .
others , like fereshta ludin , have taken the custom to their new home countries , where laws protecting the freedom of religion permit them to dress according to their beliefs .
in the current case , however , the judges overruled fereshta ludin ’ s private religious rights in favor of that of her students ’ rights to secular education .
the courts ruled that a teacher appearing before a class is a representative of the state , and should not appear as a private person endorsing a particular religious belief .
" the officeholder -lrb- of teacher -rrb- should not demonstrate private interests , but rather uphold those of the state , " the judge said .
in the interest of pupils as a legal basis , the judges cite the so-called " negative freedom of religion " act , which states that pupils must not be confronted with religious symbols against their will .
as the presiding judge in the berlin court told the press , the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom requires that pupils be protected from the state ’ s influence of religions foreign to them – also in the form of a symbol .
the pupils must not be forced to endure exposure to any religion without the chance to withdraw from it , the judge said .
the court ruled that pupils attending elementary and secondary school , where ludin wanted to teach , are still developing their personalities and that teachers have a decisive influence on their development as role models .
a history of debate religious icons were also a subject of a court ruling in 1995 by the country ’ s highest legislative body , the federal constitutional court in the city of karlsruhe .
at the time , judges declared that it was unconstitutional for state education laws in bavaria to make crucifixes prescriptive for classrooms throughout the state .
since such a measure would imply that the state openly takes sides for a distinct faith , this would violate the rights of pupils to freely choose which symbols they look at .
walking a tight line this time , the judges of the german federal court had to walk a tight line in reaching a decision that did not alienate the muslim community in germany .
for this reason , the verdict is left intentionally open and applies to symbols of any religion , not only those of muslims .
" the prohibiting of religious symbols must apply to all religious symbols , without exception , " the head judge in the baden-württemberg case said four years ago .
teachers now fear that the judgement will have far-reaching consequences , as it could theoretically apply to christian crosses worn on a necklace .
because of the decision , teachers can no longer argue that they wear a cross merely for private reasons , since fereshta ludin had used the same line of argumentation in defending her headscarf .
harsh criticism despite its efforts to maintain neutrality , the court ’ s decision sparked outrage among muslims living in germany .
the speaker of the central committee of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , aiman mazyek , told the german daily " stuttgarter nachrichten " that the verdict practically bans muslim women , who wear traditional headscarves , from working as teachers .
further , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
in a contrary position , the head of the turkish congregation in germany , hakki keskin , told the paper he found the decision appropriate , since a headscarf is indeed symbolic in character as it expresses a certain direction of faith .
ferashta ludin is now likely to take her case to germany ’ s highest court , the federal constitutional court .
and it looks like she has gained some supporters - those teachers who want to keep their crosses on their necklace . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

for four years fereshta ludin , a muslim woman from stuttgart , has been trying to convince german courts of her right to wear a headscarf while teaching .
now the federal administrative court has made a landmark decision . it was not a question of fashion , whether fereshta ludin , a 30-year-old muslim woman living in germany , could wear her headscarf while teaching class at a public school .
in 1998 , the board of education in the federal state of baden-württemberg rejected ludin ’ s application to become a teacher on the grounds that her headscarf , which ludin insisted on wearing to school during her internship , was a symbol of the islamic faith .
since then , the afghan woman from the city of stuttgart has appealed to several german courts , first on the municipal , then on the state level .
and she lost every case .
in what has become a landmark decision , the german federal administrative court in berlin ruled on thursday that teachers at public schools must refrain from openly displaying religious symbols in class , since they are representatives of the state and function as role models for their students .
religious freedom yes , but for whom ?
according to the koran , muslim women are told to wear a veil called a " hijab " to shield them from the eyes of men outside their family .
while the tradition is a basic part of daily life in islamic countries , including saudi-arabia and afghanistan , many muslim women living in the west have abandoned the practice .
others , like fereshta ludin , have taken the custom to their new home countries , where laws protecting the freedom of religion permit them to dress according to their beliefs .
in the current case , however , the judges overruled fereshta ludin ’ s private religious rights in favor of that of her students ’ rights to secular education .
the courts ruled that a teacher appearing before a class is a representative of the state , and should not appear as a private person endorsing a particular religious belief .
" the officeholder -lrb- of teacher -rrb- should not demonstrate private interests , but rather uphold those of the state , " the judge said .
in the interest of pupils as a legal basis , the judges cite the so-called " negative freedom of religion " act , which states that pupils must not be confronted with religious symbols against their will .
as the presiding judge in the berlin court told the press , the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom requires that pupils be protected from the state ’ s influence of religions foreign to them – also in the form of a symbol .
the pupils must not be forced to endure exposure to any religion without the chance to withdraw from it , the judge said .
the court ruled that pupils attending elementary and secondary school , where ludin wanted to teach , are still developing their personalities and that teachers have a decisive influence on their development as role models .
a history of debate religious icons were also a subject of a court ruling in 1995 by the country ’ s highest legislative body , the federal constitutional court in the city of karlsruhe .
at the time , judges declared that it was unconstitutional for state education laws in bavaria to make crucifixes prescriptive for classrooms throughout the state .
since such a measure would imply that the state openly takes sides for a distinct faith , this would violate the rights of pupils to freely choose which symbols they look at .
walking a tight line this time , the judges of the german federal court had to walk a tight line in reaching a decision that did not alienate the muslim community in germany .
for this reason , the verdict is left intentionally open and applies to symbols of any religion , not only those of muslims .
" the prohibiting of religious symbols must apply to all religious symbols , without exception , " the head judge in the baden-württemberg case said four years ago .
teachers now fear that the judgement will have far-reaching consequences , as it could theoretically apply to christian crosses worn on a necklace .
because of the decision , teachers can no longer argue that they wear a cross merely for private reasons , since fereshta ludin had used the same line of argumentation in defending her headscarf .
harsh criticism despite its efforts to maintain neutrality , the court ’ s decision sparked outrage among muslims living in germany .
the speaker of the central committee of muslims in germany -lrb- zmd -rrb- , aiman mazyek , told the german daily " stuttgarter nachrichten " that the verdict practically bans muslim women , who wear traditional headscarves , from working as teachers .
further , young women students who adhere to muslim traditions are now practically expelled form the workplace .
in a contrary position , the head of the turkish congregation in germany , hakki keskin , told the paper he found the decision appropriate , since a headscarf is indeed symbolic in character as it expresses a certain direction of faith .
ferashta ludin is now likely to take her case to germany ’ s highest court , the federal constitutional court .
and it looks like she has gained some supporters - those teachers who want to keep their crosses on their necklace . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .
" we have accused him of having been active in the group .
we have issued the arrest warrant on the firm suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization , " nehm told reporters after mzoudi was detained .
the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .
therefore , it is also very likely that mzoudi knew about the planned targets in the u.s.
" the accused knew the organization ’ s goals of launching terrorist attacks and supported it logistically , " nehm told the press .
the hamburg connection over the course of the last few years mzoudi shared a three-room apartment with atta and maintained close contact to al shehhi , binalshibh and said bahaji , another member of the terrorist cell still at large .
in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .
for years the young men going in and out of atta ’ s apartment went unnoticed by german authorities .
it wasn ’ t until events quickly began unfolding after last year ’ s attacks that authorities began to take a closer look at the activities of marienstraße 54 , and an entire terrorist network came to light .
profile of the accused rolf tophoven , a german expert on terrorism , said on dw-radio that the profile of mzoudi " exactly matches the profile of the whole group around mohammed atta .
they all had one thing in common : they received extensive training at camps in afghanistan .
obviously the accused had knowledge of the targets in the u.s. and probably also other selected targets in western europe . "
tophoven stressed that mzoudi and mounir el motassadeq , another suspected member of the hamburg al qaeda cell who goes on trial later this month , are only the tip of the iceberg .
when it comes to uncovering the terrorist network in germany , the authorities have only begin putting the pieces together , he said .
germany ’ s federal prosecutor admitted that investigations into the hamburg group had been difficult but also successful .
" what we have achieved so far is excellent in international comparison .
no other country has come this far , " nehm told reporters .
on friday mzoudi will be brought before an investigating judge of the federal supreme court in karlsruhe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany the past year has been an illuminating one for german anti-terrorism investigators .

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .
content of book likely to agitate catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldhagen holds the catholic church responsible for not protecting the jews .
some of the book 's core research material appeared as a 27,000-word essay in the american political magazine " the new republic " in january .
in the essay , goldhagen reiterates widely reported allegations that suggest that pius xii , the wartime pope , did not do enough to protect the jews , even though he likely knew of the fate which awaited them .
the vatican has always argued that its cautious , non-confrontational policy saved more people than would have been the case if it had spoken out in condemnation of the nazis .
goldhagen says such arguments are bizarre and nonsensical , topped only by those of revisionist historians , who try to argue the holocaust never actually happen .
goldhagen , a professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is no stranger to controversy or ruffling the feathers of germans .

the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .
therefore , it is also very likely that mzoudi knew about the planned targets in the u.s.
" the accused knew the organization ’ s goals of launching terrorist attacks and supported it logistically , " nehm told the press .
the hamburg connection over the course of the last few years mzoudi shared a three-room apartment with atta and maintained close contact to al shehhi , binalshibh and said bahaji , another member of the terrorist cell still at large .
in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .
for years the young men going in and out of atta ’ s apartment went unnoticed by german authorities .
it wasn ’ t until events quickly began unfolding after last year ’ s attacks that authorities began to take a closer look at the activities of marienstraße 54 , and an entire terrorist network came to light .
profile of the accused rolf tophoven , a german expert on terrorism , said on dw-radio that the profile of mzoudi " exactly matches the profile of the whole group around mohammed atta .
they all had one thing in common : they received extensive training at camps in afghanistan .
obviously the accused had knowledge of the targets in the u.s. and probably also other selected targets in western europe . "
tophoven stressed that mzoudi and mounir el motassadeq , another suspected member of the hamburg al qaeda cell who goes on trial later this month , are only the tip of the iceberg .
when it comes to uncovering the terrorist network in germany , the authorities have only begin putting the pieces together , he said .
germany ’ s federal prosecutor admitted that investigations into the hamburg group had been difficult but also successful .
" what we have achieved so far is excellent in international comparison .
no other country has come this far , " nehm told reporters .

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .
content of book likely to agitate catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldhagen holds the catholic church responsible for not protecting the jews .
some of the book 's core research material appeared as a 27,000-word essay in the american political magazine " the new republic " in january .
in the essay , goldhagen reiterates widely reported allegations that suggest that pius xii , the wartime pope , did not do enough to protect the jews , even though he likely knew of the fate which awaited them .
the vatican has always argued that its cautious , non-confrontational policy saved more people than would have been the case if it had spoken out in condemnation of the nazis .
goldhagen says such arguments are bizarre and nonsensical , topped only by those of revisionist historians , who try to argue the holocaust never actually happen .
goldhagen , a professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is no stranger to controversy or ruffling the feathers of germans .

this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .
with the help of the frankfurt book fair , this easily overlooked country on europe 's eastern border hopes to attract more public awareness in western europe to its unique literary cultural landscape .
" to be continued " the motto " to be continued " is an allusion to " the frequent interruption of the development of the country by wars and occupation " , according to the organisers , and is a " reflection of the intention of the presentation : to concentrate on the contemporary scene , without forgetting it ’ s history . "
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .
" the most important works were written after the war , in exile " , said german author marianna butenschön , an expert in lithuanian literature .
a new era the collapse of communism and lithuania 's successive independence in 1989 saw the start of a new era for lithuanian literature .
a new generation of authors appeared on the international literary stage – lithuanian authors returned after years in exile .
in addition , numerous translated manuscripts written by these writers in the years of lithuania 's occupation underwent yet another translation – this time back into their original language .
one author who experienced these changes is ricardas gavelis , who published his novel vilna poker in 1989 , a book which he had completed two years before publication .
too much human flesh gavelis ' book , which protested both against the russian regime and against the supporting powers in lithuania , was met with controversy his own home country , especially among those who felt the need to protect their former life under communism and lithuanian traditions .
but his was not the only book published after 1989 that ignited controversy .
books which included the human body and the inner self , subjects that were for years taboo under the strict regime , were met with disgust , not least due to lithuania 's large catholic community .
however , the country 's young authors remained undeterred in their literary work .
" the young authors who began writing after the fall of communism are a lot more open when it comes to dealing with tradition and set forms , and also with their own bodies , " says ausrine jonikaite , lithuanian coordinator at the frankfurt book fair .
banned books in 1993 , 39-year-old jurga ivanauskaite 's book rain witch was banned .
a love story told by three women - a modern-day bohemian outsider , a medieval witch and mary magdalene - it was immediately condemned in official circles as pornography .
jurga ivanauskaite resolved to leave the country .
ironically , she is today one of the country 's most well known writers of lithuanian contemporary literature .
struggling literary scene ivanauskaite is one of 26 lithuanian authors taking part in the frankfurt book fair .
but their presence can not hide the fact that authors from this country can still not survive from writing alone , and that lithuania is still struggling to establish a professional literary scene .
sales are , in comparison to former communist times , low , and not one of the 300 registered authors can compete with western literature .
" lithuania , " marianna butenschön says , " lithuania is a country in transition " . gabriela schaaf send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt book fair dw-world dossier on the world 's largest book fair 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .

i 'm reading far from killing off the printed word , the internet is actually creating new opportunities for the publishing industry - but is it helping or just making things worse ? at the 54th frankfurt book fair , which runs from oct .
9-14 , the general atmosphere is one of foreboding and doom .
one of the key issues this year is the decline in annual book sales and the much-needed restructuring of the german publishing industry .
after years of growth , the industry is suffering its first real economic slump .
at first glance , advances in technology could be held partly responsible for this .
in fact , however , new media is giving a helping hand to the ailing publishing industry .
it is the single ray of light that has broken the gloom of the annual book fair .
originally , the internet was heralded as the death knell for the printed word .
a technological wonder that would make the need to search through dusty old book stores a thing of the past .
there , on shiny screens , would be the pages we once flicked through and whose corners we bent .
the internet was set to revolutionise literature .
and it has .
but not in the same way as many net boosters claimed it would .
each year technology buffs talk of the end of the book as we know it , even as printed and bound volumes continued to sell like hotcakes .
what has happened , however , is that the internet has become a rival to the conventional way we buy our books .
time to take advantage of technology , say publishers judging by the opinion of 45 per cent of german publishing houses , the time of cost-free internet bargains is over .
it is time to utilise the medium for the benefit of publishing while avoiding napster 's give-away philosophy , which some argue has crippled the music industry .
a boom in electronic media has seen the popularity of electronic , or e-books , improve dramatically .
around one million of these online versions of books , which can be downloaded for a fee , have been bought this year on the internet , hermann salmen , chief executive of the e-book publisher gemstar ebook told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
handheld ebooks , personal digital assistant-sized computers , have also become popular ways of receiving the manuscripts .
pda 's can carry over 4,000 pages of text or the equivalent of ten books .
it is an area of the book market that looks set to expand .
three-out-of-five publishing houses say that they want the percentage of their revenue from electronic books to increase to between five and 20 per cent in the next five years .
in most cases , it is currently less than five per cent , according to a survey recently conducted by the working group for electronic publishing of the german publishers and booksellers association .
around a fifth of publishers who currently produce electronic publications make a profit from the enterprise while a further 44 per cent break even , according to a report released at the book fair on wednesday by the same group .
still room for both markets to grow but far from becoming a deathmatch between tradition and technology , most of the big publishers agree there is plenty of room for both print and electronic publishing .
" the internet isn ’ t eating up books , it ’ s writing new ones , " matthias winter , manager of an internet encyclopaedia established by german publishing giant bertelsmann , told the news agency dpa . the company is currently showing off both its reference web site and its most recent print publication , a guide to the site that is already producing healthy sales at the frankfurt book fair .
online shopping has also provided the possibility of a new literary market , allowing those people who would not normally spend hours in a book shop to find the publications they want .
sales of books - the hard copy , real thing - have increased over the internet due to the ease with which literature can be found and paid for .
titles from all over the world have become available at the click of a button and all from the comfort of your own home .
the larger publishers and distributors have been quick to recognise the benefits .

one of the key issues this year is the decline in annual book sales and the much-needed restructuring of the german publishing industry .
after years of growth , the industry is suffering its first real economic slump .
at first glance , advances in technology could be held partly responsible for this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.10.2002 germany arrests terrorist helper großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi is escorted by two german police officers 13 months after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , german authorities have succeeded in arresting a man suspected of assisting the hamburg-based al qaeda cell . early thursday morning , police in the german city of hamburg arrested a 29-year old moroccan man believed to have connections to the al qaeda cell of hijackers responsible for the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .
" we have accused him of having been active in the group .
we have issued the arrest warrant on the firm suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization , " nehm told reporters after mzoudi was detained .
the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .
therefore , it is also very likely that mzoudi knew about the planned targets in the u.s.
" the accused knew the organization ’ s goals of launching terrorist attacks and supported it logistically , " nehm told the press .
the hamburg connection over the course of the last few years mzoudi shared a three-room apartment with atta and maintained close contact to al shehhi , binalshibh and said bahaji , another member of the terrorist cell still at large .
in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .
for years the young men going in and out of atta ’ s apartment went unnoticed by german authorities .
it wasn ’ t until events quickly began unfolding after last year ’ s attacks that authorities began to take a closer look at the activities of marienstraße 54 , and an entire terrorist network came to light .
profile of the accused rolf tophoven , a german expert on terrorism , said on dw-radio that the profile of mzoudi " exactly matches the profile of the whole group around mohammed atta .
they all had one thing in common : they received extensive training at camps in afghanistan .
obviously the accused had knowledge of the targets in the u.s. and probably also other selected targets in western europe . "
tophoven stressed that mzoudi and mounir el motassadeq , another suspected member of the hamburg al qaeda cell who goes on trial later this month , are only the tip of the iceberg .
when it comes to uncovering the terrorist network in germany , the authorities have only begin putting the pieces together , he said .
germany ’ s federal prosecutor admitted that investigations into the hamburg group had been difficult but also successful .
" what we have achieved so far is excellent in international comparison .
no other country has come this far , " nehm told reporters .
on friday mzoudi will be brought before an investigating judge of the federal supreme court in karlsruhe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany the past year has been an illuminating one for german anti-terrorism investigators .

this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .
with the help of the frankfurt book fair , this easily overlooked country on europe 's eastern border hopes to attract more public awareness in western europe to its unique literary cultural landscape .

key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .
" we have accused him of having been active in the group .
we have issued the arrest warrant on the firm suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization , " nehm told reporters after mzoudi was detained .
the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .
therefore , it is also very likely that mzoudi knew about the planned targets in the u.s.
" the accused knew the organization ’ s goals of launching terrorist attacks and supported it logistically , " nehm told the press .
the hamburg connection over the course of the last few years mzoudi shared a three-room apartment with atta and maintained close contact to al shehhi , binalshibh and said bahaji , another member of the terrorist cell still at large .
in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .
for years the young men going in and out of atta ’ s apartment went unnoticed by german authorities .
it wasn ’ t until events quickly began unfolding after last year ’ s attacks that authorities began to take a closer look at the activities of marienstraße 54 , and an entire terrorist network came to light .
profile of the accused rolf tophoven , a german expert on terrorism , said on dw-radio that the profile of mzoudi " exactly matches the profile of the whole group around mohammed atta .
they all had one thing in common : they received extensive training at camps in afghanistan .
obviously the accused had knowledge of the targets in the u.s. and probably also other selected targets in western europe . "
tophoven stressed that mzoudi and mounir el motassadeq , another suspected member of the hamburg al qaeda cell who goes on trial later this month , are only the tip of the iceberg .
when it comes to uncovering the terrorist network in germany , the authorities have only begin putting the pieces together , he said .
germany ’ s federal prosecutor admitted that investigations into the hamburg group had been difficult but also successful .

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "
the church claims the caption is false and that the cardinal was not the person in the picture .
catholic officials say the person shown in the photograph with former propaganda minister hermann göring , among others , was most likely the vatican 's then-ambassador to germany , nuntius orsenigo .
christian ottmann , spokesperson for the munich diocese , told the associated press that " the publishing house must recall the book or black out the caption . "
if this is not done , the book 's berlin-based publisher , wolf jopst siedler , could face a 250,000 euro -lrb- $ 246,000 -rrb- fine .
the united states holocaust memorial museum , which holds the original photograph , initially disputed the claim that the person in the photograph was someone else .
on thursday , a spokesman told dw-world that the museum is taking another look .
" we have stopped circulating it , " said deputy spokesman andew hollinger .
" as far as i know , we are revisiting trying to confirm this person 's identity . "
the church , meanwhile , has invited researchers to take a look at the recently-released faulhaber archives in an effort to clarify the matter .
although the contentious caption and its offending photograph are quoted as the main reason behind the action taken against the book and its author , it is likely that its content could also be seen as a catalyst for the catholic church 's anger .
content of book likely to agitate catholics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldhagen holds the catholic church responsible for not protecting the jews .
some of the book 's core research material appeared as a 27,000-word essay in the american political magazine " the new republic " in january .
in the essay , goldhagen reiterates widely reported allegations that suggest that pius xii , the wartime pope , did not do enough to protect the jews , even though he likely knew of the fate which awaited them .
the vatican has always argued that its cautious , non-confrontational policy saved more people than would have been the case if it had spoken out in condemnation of the nazis .
goldhagen says such arguments are bizarre and nonsensical , topped only by those of revisionist historians , who try to argue the holocaust never actually happen .
goldhagen , a professor of government and social studies at harvard university , is no stranger to controversy or ruffling the feathers of germans .
his best-known book , hitler 's willing executioners , blamed ordinary germans for the holocaust .
although some critics accused him of taking liberties with the truth and writing in a confrontational style , the book became a best-seller and award winner . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live discover germany we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.10.2002 germany arrests terrorist helper großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi is escorted by two german police officers 13 months after the september 11 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , german authorities have succeeded in arresting a man suspected of assisting the hamburg-based al qaeda cell . early thursday morning , police in the german city of hamburg arrested a 29-year old moroccan man believed to have connections to the al qaeda cell of hijackers responsible for the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .
" we have accused him of having been active in the group .
we have issued the arrest warrant on the firm suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization , " nehm told reporters after mzoudi was detained .
the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .
therefore , it is also very likely that mzoudi knew about the planned targets in the u.s.
" the accused knew the organization ’ s goals of launching terrorist attacks and supported it logistically , " nehm told the press .
the hamburg connection over the course of the last few years mzoudi shared a three-room apartment with atta and maintained close contact to al shehhi , binalshibh and said bahaji , another member of the terrorist cell still at large .
in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .
for years the young men going in and out of atta ’ s apartment went unnoticed by german authorities .
it wasn ’ t until events quickly began unfolding after last year ’ s attacks that authorities began to take a closer look at the activities of marienstraße 54 , and an entire terrorist network came to light .
profile of the accused rolf tophoven , a german expert on terrorism , said on dw-radio that the profile of mzoudi " exactly matches the profile of the whole group around mohammed atta .
they all had one thing in common : they received extensive training at camps in afghanistan .
obviously the accused had knowledge of the targets in the u.s. and probably also other selected targets in western europe . "

a german court has issued a temporary injunction against publication of a new book by controversial american author and historian daniel goldhagen about the catholic church 's history in third reich germany . the regional court in munich responded to a demand by munich 's archdiocese that the book be withdrawn from publication over a factual error .
the district court issued its ruling on tuesday based on evidence that information contained in the publication implied false association of a member of the catholic church with hitler 's third reich in world war ii .
in goldhagen 's new book , a moral reckoning : the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair , a photograph showing a person marching with ss officers at a nazi rally in munich comes with a caption identifying the man as the city 's then-cardinal , michael faulhaber .
church says man in photograph not cardinal the caption accompanying the photo reads : " cardinal michael faulhaber marches at a nazi rally in munich through an s.s. honour guard . "

this year , lithuania is the focal point of the world 's largest book fair , which kicked off in frankfurt wednesday . the largest of the three baltic states , lithuania has being trying for years to reassert its place in europe since declaring independence from the soviet union in 1990 .
with the help of the frankfurt book fair , this easily overlooked country on europe 's eastern border hopes to attract more public awareness in western europe to its unique literary cultural landscape .
" to be continued " the motto " to be continued " is an allusion to " the frequent interruption of the development of the country by wars and occupation " , according to the organisers , and is a " reflection of the intention of the presentation : to concentrate on the contemporary scene , without forgetting it ’ s history . "
the first book in lithuania was printed in the 16th century , but lithuanian as a recognized literary language has only existed since 1820 .
time was short for those with an interest or talent in literature – more than half the country 's authors had to flee as the russians occupied lithuania in 1944 .
those who remained were either supporters of the communist regime or optimistic poets , who spent their literary lives under constant fear , and were careful to hide any criticism between the lines .
" the most important works were written after the war , in exile " , said german author marianna butenschön , an expert in lithuanian literature .
a new era the collapse of communism and lithuania 's successive independence in 1989 saw the start of a new era for lithuanian literature .
a new generation of authors appeared on the international literary stage – lithuanian authors returned after years in exile .
in addition , numerous translated manuscripts written by these writers in the years of lithuania 's occupation underwent yet another translation – this time back into their original language .
one author who experienced these changes is ricardas gavelis , who published his novel vilna poker in 1989 , a book which he had completed two years before publication .
too much human flesh gavelis ' book , which protested both against the russian regime and against the supporting powers in lithuania , was met with controversy his own home country , especially among those who felt the need to protect their former life under communism and lithuanian traditions .
but his was not the only book published after 1989 that ignited controversy .
books which included the human body and the inner self , subjects that were for years taboo under the strict regime , were met with disgust , not least due to lithuania 's large catholic community .
however , the country 's young authors remained undeterred in their literary work .
" the young authors who began writing after the fall of communism are a lot more open when it comes to dealing with tradition and set forms , and also with their own bodies , " says ausrine jonikaite , lithuanian coordinator at the frankfurt book fair .
banned books in 1993 , 39-year-old jurga ivanauskaite 's book rain witch was banned .
a love story told by three women - a modern-day bohemian outsider , a medieval witch and mary magdalene - it was immediately condemned in official circles as pornography .
jurga ivanauskaite resolved to leave the country .
ironically , she is today one of the country 's most well known writers of lithuanian contemporary literature .
struggling literary scene ivanauskaite is one of 26 lithuanian authors taking part in the frankfurt book fair .
but their presence can not hide the fact that authors from this country can still not survive from writing alone , and that lithuania is still struggling to establish a professional literary scene .
sales are , in comparison to former communist times , low , and not one of the 300 registered authors can compete with western literature .

key nehm , germany ’ s federal prosecutor , said abdelghani mzoudi , who shared an apartment with several of the members of the terrorist cell centered on mohammed atta , most likely had extensive contacts to the al qaeda network and provided logistical help for carrying out the attacks .
" we have accused him of having been active in the group .
we have issued the arrest warrant on the firm suspicion of aiding a terrorist organization , " nehm told reporters after mzoudi was detained .
the prosecutor ’ s office , however , admitted that at the moment it had no hard evidence actually proving that mzoudi was an active participant in the hamburg terrorist cell , in which case he would be tried as an accessory to murder .
" but we think that we will be able to get him closer to the group , " nehm added in reference to statements made by a witness who knew mzoudi had received al qaeda terrorist training in afghanistan .
what is certain , the prosecutor said , is that mzoudi had close contact to atta , the mastermind of the sept .
11 attacks , and two other hijackers who died in the attacks , marwan al shehhi and ziad jarrah , as well as to key al qaeda suspect ramzi binalshibh , who was recently arrested in pakistan .
therefore , it is also very likely that mzoudi knew about the planned targets in the u.s.
" the accused knew the organization ’ s goals of launching terrorist attacks and supported it logistically , " nehm told the press .
the hamburg connection over the course of the last few years mzoudi shared a three-room apartment with atta and maintained close contact to al shehhi , binalshibh and said bahaji , another member of the terrorist cell still at large .
in addition , german authorities believe mzoudi gave money to zakariya essabar for flying lessons in the united states and arranged accommodation for al shehhi prior to leaving for the u.s. in may 2000 .
essabar is a suspected al qaeda terrorist currently being sought , and al shehhi is thought to have piloted the second plane into the world trade center .
mzoudi and the other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell were enrolled as students at the city ’ s technical college .
for years the young men going in and out of atta ’ s apartment went unnoticed by german authorities .
it wasn ’ t until events quickly began unfolding after last year ’ s attacks that authorities began to take a closer look at the activities of marienstraße 54 , and an entire terrorist network came to light .
profile of the accused rolf tophoven , a german expert on terrorism , said on dw-radio that the profile of mzoudi " exactly matches the profile of the whole group around mohammed atta .
they all had one thing in common : they received extensive training at camps in afghanistan .
obviously the accused had knowledge of the targets in the u.s. and probably also other selected targets in western europe . "
tophoven stressed that mzoudi and mounir el motassadeq , another suspected member of the hamburg al qaeda cell who goes on trial later this month , are only the tip of the iceberg .
when it comes to uncovering the terrorist network in germany , the authorities have only begin putting the pieces together , he said .
germany ’ s federal prosecutor admitted that investigations into the hamburg group had been difficult but also successful .
" what we have achieved so far is excellent in international comparison .
no other country has come this far , " nehm told reporters .
on friday mzoudi will be brought before an investigating judge of the federal supreme court in karlsruhe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de radical islamic terrorism still a threat in germany the past year has been an illuminating one for german anti-terrorism investigators .

opponents say spraying damages health and the environment the colombian state 's human rights watchdog , the people 's defender , accused the authorities of damaging the health of locals and the environment in the province of putumayo .
every year the american government finances the aerial fumigation of more fields of coca and poppy , the raw materials for cocaine and heroin , and every year the number of hectares under drug cultivation goes up , along with the amount of virgin forest destroyed .
yet this year , with the blessing of hardline president alvaro uribe , more hectares than ever will be fumigated .
peasant victims the policy has long been criticised by human rights groups and environmentalists .
uribe is a champion of the us-backed programme human rights groups say the policy attacks the weakest part of the drugs chain - the peasant farmers who grow coca as the only way to survive and do not share in the massive profits that the smugglers and dealers in the us get .
environmentalists complain that the herbicides used damage the environment , killing all plant life , not just drug crops .
and now the people 's defender 's office has weighed in , calling for a halt to spraying in putumayo , colombia 's coca growing heartland .
eduardo cifuentes , the colombian ombudsman , said he has received more than 6,500 complaints this year of planes fumigating food crops , leaving peasants without a livelihood , damaging the health of people - particularly children caught outside as the chemicals are dropped - and causing great damage to the sensitive eco-system of the amazon .
no notice but the government is unlikely to pay the slightest attention to the latest protest .
president uribe has vowed to eradicate drugs altogether from colombia as part of his war to re-establish state authority .
plus the fact the us insists the policy must continue .
and since colombia is one of the top recipients of us aid in the world , it is unlikely to risk offending its powerful northern neighbour .

by jorn madslien bbc news online business reporter at the paris motor show nobody doubts that the latest version of audi 's luxury car - on show for the first time at the paris motor show - is a fine car .
queuing to see the new a8 ?
the new a8 's lighter aluminium space frame will be clad with new aluminium sheets which will cover its new engines , including its top-of-the-range 4.2 litre v8 - which will eventually be supplemented with the option of a 12-cylinder engine on a stretched version of the car .
drivers of the latest audi will even be kitted out with electronic keys which automatically unlock the doors and activate the ignition so the engine can be started by pressing a button .
" it 's a completely new car , " insisted audi france 's product manager , alexis fetzer in an interview with bbc news online .
originality but is it ?
despite a facelift which has been widely accepted as successful , the a8 shown to the punters at the paris motor show seems remarkably dated .
at least when compared with its much more original competitor , the volkswagen phaeton limousine which was launched at the geneva motor show in march .
paradoxically , both cars belong to europe 's largest car company , volkswagen group .
so there is little wonder that many audi dealers are disgruntled .
the phaeton - which will be kitted out with just as large engines , will be just as expensive and just as luxurious - is said to have delayed the launch of the latest a8 .
and although the phaeton will be 600lb heavier than the new a8 , both are heavy cars .
the new a8 weighs more than earlier models since its lighter frame has failed to make up for heavier components and electronic gizmos .
and , notably , it is heavier than jaguar 's new aluminium xj .
titans clash worse still , the phaeton is seen as a threat to audi 's role as volkswagen 's main upmarket brand - leaving its bentley , bugatti and lamborghini marques aside - despite the group 's insistence that the two models will not compete .
late arrival for the booming 4x4 market " the strategy is a bit different and the target is completely different , " said mr fetzer .
" at audi , we have the audi customers who are going to buy the new a8 , and at volkswagen there 's a completely new customer coming more from mercedes . "
however , such talk may more be a reflection of hope than reality .
after all , the phaeton was originated under volkswagen 's former boss , ferdinand piech .
and mr piech 's strategy was to encourage the group 's four volume brands - audi , seat , skoda and volkswagen - " to compete with each other as much as with -lsb- other -rsb- competitors " , automotive sector analysts just-auto.com observed .
new boss under its new group chairman , dr bernd pischetsrieder , volkswagen is about to change that .
" schooled in the impeccable disciplines of bmw brand management , -lsb- dr pischetsrieder -rsb- has decided that -lsb- such internal head-on competition within the group -rsb- does not make a lot of sense , " according to just-auto.com.
but there is a long way from rejecting an old concept to introducing a new one .
and some industry observers point out that dr pischetsrieder , who was in charge of bmw during the rover years , has a pretty poor track record as a multi-brand manager .
queried one observer : " he failed at bmw with the rover brand , so why should he succeed at vw ? "
opportunities rather than waiting for industry commentators to agree on whether or not he is up to the job , dr pischetsrieder has set out to prove his worth .
as a first step towards reducing the company 's model range , dr pischetsrieder has decided that loss makers like audi 's little a2 and volkswagen 's little lupo should not be replaced .
the replacement of key - and sometimes very similar - models like the vw golf , the skoda octavia and the audi a3 are to be staggered , and they will be altered to make them more different from each other .
the images of volkswagen 's different marques will also be overhauled .
at the paris motor show , the image of the seat stand is youthful , loud and sporty while both audi 's and vw 's stands are more sedate and sensible .
the group is also making moves to catch up with its competitors in the some of the fastest growing markets in the sector , namely those for minivans and 4x4s - or sports utility vehicles -lrb- suvs -rrb- .
in paris , volkswagen 's touareg 4x4 and its touran minivan were launched amidst claims that its late arrival to these growth markets offers " tremendous opportunities " .
making money but there is no point in making new models if they do not enable volkswagen to make more money .
during summer , dr pischetsrieder made it clear that the group is making less money than it had hoped .
volkswagen reduced its output almost 8 % during the first six months of this year as weak demand in europe , the us and brazil hit total sales hard .
as a consequence , the group revised its profit prediction for the year as a whole to 3.9bn euros -lrb- $ 3.85bn ; £ 2.47bn -rrb- from earlier predictions of 4.4bn euros .

the new a8 's lighter aluminium space frame will be clad with new aluminium sheets which will cover its new engines , including its top-of-the-range 4.2 litre v8 - which will eventually be supplemented with the option of a 12-cylinder engine on a stretched version of the car .
drivers of the latest audi will even be kitted out with electronic keys which automatically unlock the doors and activate the ignition so the engine can be started by pressing a button .
" it 's a completely new car , " insisted audi france 's product manager , alexis fetzer in an interview with bbc news online .
originality but is it ?
despite a facelift which has been widely accepted as successful , the a8 shown to the punters at the paris motor show seems remarkably dated .
at least when compared with its much more original competitor , the volkswagen phaeton limousine which was launched at the geneva motor show in march .
paradoxically , both cars belong to europe 's largest car company , volkswagen group .
so there is little wonder that many audi dealers are disgruntled .
the phaeton - which will be kitted out with just as large engines , will be just as expensive and just as luxurious - is said to have delayed the launch of the latest a8 .
and although the phaeton will be 600lb heavier than the new a8 , both are heavy cars .
the new a8 weighs more than earlier models since its lighter frame has failed to make up for heavier components and electronic gizmos .
and , notably , it is heavier than jaguar 's new aluminium xj .
titans clash worse still , the phaeton is seen as a threat to audi 's role as volkswagen 's main upmarket brand - leaving its bentley , bugatti and lamborghini marques aside - despite the group 's insistence that the two models will not compete .
" the strategy is a bit different and the target is completely different , " said mr fetzer .
" at audi , we have the audi customers who are going to buy the new a8 , and at volkswagen there 's a completely new customer coming more from mercedes . "
however , such talk may more be a reflection of hope than reality .
after all , the phaeton was originated under volkswagen 's former boss , ferdinand piech .
and mr piech 's strategy was to encourage the group 's four volume brands - audi , seat , skoda and volkswagen - " to compete with each other as much as with -lsb- other -rsb- competitors " , automotive sector analysts just-auto.com observed .
new boss under its new group chairman , dr bernd pischetsrieder , volkswagen is about to change that .
" schooled in the impeccable disciplines of bmw brand management , -lsb- dr pischetsrieder -rsb- has decided that -lsb- such internal head-on competition within the group -rsb- does not make a lot of sense , " according to just-auto.com.
but there is a long way from rejecting an old concept to introducing a new one .
and some industry observers point out that dr pischetsrieder , who was in charge of bmw during the rover years , has a pretty poor track record as a multi-brand manager .
queried one observer : " he failed at bmw with the rover brand , so why should he succeed at vw ? "
opportunities rather than waiting for industry commentators to agree on whether or not he is up to the job , dr pischetsrieder has set out to prove his worth .
as a first step towards reducing the company 's model range , dr pischetsrieder has decided that loss makers like audi 's little a2 and volkswagen 's little lupo should not be replaced .
the replacement of key - and sometimes very similar - models like the vw golf , the skoda octavia and the audi a3 are to be staggered , and they will be altered to make them more different from each other .
the images of volkswagen 's different marques will also be overhauled .
at the paris motor show , the image of the seat stand is youthful , loud and sporty while both audi 's and vw 's stands are more sedate and sensible .
the group is also making moves to catch up with its competitors in the some of the fastest growing markets in the sector , namely those for minivans and 4x4s - or sports utility vehicles -lrb- suvs -rrb- .
in paris , volkswagen 's touareg 4x4 and its touran minivan were launched amidst claims that its late arrival to these growth markets offers " tremendous opportunities " .
making money but there is no point in making new models if they do not enable volkswagen to make more money .
during summer , dr pischetsrieder made it clear that the group is making less money than it had hoped .
volkswagen reduced its output almost 8 % during the first six months of this year as weak demand in europe , the us and brazil hit total sales hard .
as a consequence , the group revised its profit prediction for the year as a whole to 3.9bn euros -lrb- $ 3.85bn ; £ 2.47bn -rrb- from earlier predictions of 4.4bn euros .

their choice is influential , as the award confers on laureates great media attention as well as moral force and 10 million swedish kronor -lrb- $ 1.07m -rrb- .
previous winners have ranged from already famous political prisoners to more obscure peace groups .
the selection process is notoriously opaque , but bbc news online 's jim todd examines the chances of some high-profile nominees .
hamid karzai this year , many of the nominations are being seen in the light of the 11 september 2001 terror attacks on the united states , and hamid karzai is one of the beneficiaries of the ensuing war on terror declared by president george w bush .
the pashtun tribal leader was little known outside afghanistan until the search began for a successor to the islamic extremist taleban regime which had harboured osama bin laden .
he narrowly escaped death after entering the country to help engineer the taleban 's fall , only surviving after a us military helicopter plucked him to safety .
he became the interim government 's first leader in december 2001 , persuaded foreign donors to pledge large sums of reconstruction money and was elected leader by a conference of tribal groups and politicians in june .
but instability in afghanistan continues .
he survived an assassination attempt in september and much of the promised aid has not materialised .
in some quarters mr karzai is viewed as an american stooge and his support from the us may count against him with the nobel peace committee .
stein toennesson , head of the international peace research institute in oslo , believes the committee would like to give the prize to a muslim this year , but thinks that the afghan leader has not achieved enough yet to merit the prize .
" perhaps there is too much support for him from the united states at a time when it is preparing for a new war , " he told bbc news online .
george bush-tony blair the us president and british prime minister have been nominated by a right-wing norwegian member of parliament .
harald tom nesvik , party for progress , praised their " decisive action against terrorism , something i believe in the future will be the greatest threat to peace " .
but this is a remote prospect .
one of the five members of the committee publicly criticised the bombing campaign in afghanistan , even before the two leaders began threatening to wage war against saddam hussein 's iraq .
" i would fall off my chair if they got it , " said fredrik s heffermehl , president of the norwegian peace alliance .
us senators lugar and nunn former democratic senator sam nunn and republican senator richard lugar are tipped as winners this year for two reasons .
firstly , their 10-year-old project to safeguard the former soviet union 's nuclear waste and its arsenal strikes a chord in norway , which has a particular interest in environmental dangers not so far from its borders .
under the nunn-lugar agreement , america is thought to have spent several billion dollars on securing the former soviet union 's vast arsenal of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .
but some of the weapons stocks remain unaccounted for and the 11 september attacks and subsequent anthrax outbreaks have rekindled fears that some may have fallen into the wrong hands .
secondly , the committee could be looking to encourage the voices of moderation in the american political elite , and senator lugar - a senior member of the senate foreign relations committee - has called on president bush to seek a multilateral solution to the iraq crisis .
war crimes tribunal two war crimes courts were inaugurated under united nations auspices in the 1990s : in arusha , tanzania , for the trial of suspects in the 1994 rwandan genocide in the hague , netherlands , for war crimes committed in the territory of the former yugoslavia after 1991 .
after an uncertain start , when it failed to net any important suspects , the hague tribunal came into its own with the arrest and extradition of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic from belgrade .
the lower-profile arusha court , meanwhile , has been dogged by delays and accusations of incompetence .
" maybe next year , after the conclusion of the milosevic trial , " fredrik heffermehl told bbc news online .
nevertheless , the court could be awarded the prize - possibly split with its energetic chief war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte - if the committee thought it would boost the nascent international criminal court .
this tribunal - which is not expected to be fully operational until next year - has been hamstrung by american opposition .
jimmy carter the former american president has mediated in many disputes and conflicts , and his well-funded carter institute has a number of successful health programmes to its credit .
earlier this year , he made a high-profile visit to communist cuba , the latest attempt by us moderates to break the ice after decades of hostility .
the 1994 deal he did with north korea still holds , under which the then leader kim il-sung froze his nuclear weapons programme in return for us help in building nuclear reactors .
" a compromise candidate if the committee could n't agree , " is stein toenesson 's verdict .
rudy giuliani this would be a sympathy vote for the people of new york after the devastating suicide attacks on the world trade center .
the new york fire department has also been nominated .
the problem is that he has n't actually created any kind of peace initiative - and recent comments that he would like to be the executioner if osama bin laden was ever caught ca n't have done him much good in norway .
the death penalty was abolished there more than 20 years ago .
bono the wild card .
the frontman of irish rock band u2 , proper name paul hewson , has been much praised for his campaign to eradicate third world debt .
he has tirelessly lobbied western leaders to increase aid to developing countries and earlier this year went on a 10-day trip with us treasury secretary paul o 'neil around africa to try to change his mind on anti-poverty campaigns .

patients received one of the two drugs in combination with the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel .
we need much , much better drugs professor stephen spiro , british lung foundation it was found patients given cisplatin and paclitaxel had better survival rates and as good a quality of life as those receiving the other medication .
in europe , including the uk , patients are already given cisplatin , while in the us , doctors usually choose to use carboplatin .
the newer drug was developed because cisplatin is very toxic , and patients need to stay in hospital for several hours or even overnight , so they can have the drug washed through their kidneys using intravenous fluids .
survival rates the study , published in the journal annals of oncology , found around a quarter of both groups responded to their treatment .
but , on average , those who were taking cisplatin and paclitaxel survived for 9.8 months , compared to 8.5 months in those taking carboplatin .
thirty-eight per cent of those in the cisplatin group , compared with 33 % of those on carboplatin , survived for a year .
after two years , the survival rates were 15 % and 9 % respectively .
the findings are in contrast to a recent us study which found no difference between the two drugs .
dr rafael rosell from the hospital germans trias i pujol in barcelona , spain , who led the research , said the findings suggested cisplatin-based chemotherapy should be the first treatment option , although paclitaxel and carboplatin was still a viable alternative .
writing in the journal , dr thierry le chevalier of the institute gustave roussy in villejuif cedex , france , said the research was important .
but he said new medications were needed : " new treatment strategies are needed to overcome the limits of conventional chemotherapy . "
' magic bullet ' dr john harvey , a spokesman for the british thoracic society , told bbc news online : " this study tends to support that we 're using the right combination of chemotherapy drugs for patients with non-small cell lung cancer .
" the difficulty is that , although the differences between the drugs are significant , they are small - and after two years , you are down to a very small number of patients . "
dr harvey , a lung specialist at bristol 's southmead hospital , added : " what this really shows is that we need a completely new agent , a " magic bullet " that targets cancer dna in addition to using chemotherapy . "
stephen spiro , spokesman for the british lung foundation , and professor of thoracic medicine at university college hospital london , added : " we have reached an absolute limit of eight to 10 months average survival for advanced cancers .
" we need much , much better drugs . "

a new survey by the government 's conservation advisers , english nature , shows the county has the ideal conditions for them to thrive .
a new survey has found there are only 5,500 bats nationwide and devon is home to about 1,800 .
more surveys are to be carried out to monitor the health of the population .
they do n't do people any harm - they 're not blind and they 're not going to fly into your hair john diamond , english nature devon is good for greater horseshoe bats for several reasons .
the landscape has many hedges , which they use for navigation and winters are relatively mild , giving them a better chance of surviving hibernation .
there are also many old buildings , which the bats like to roost in .
and there is plenty of cow manure , home to the favourite food of young bats , the dung beetle .
john diamond , from english nature , said : " a few people know they 're here and very few people actually see them .
" but that 's one of their attractions - they 're very elusive and few people know they 're around .
" and , of course , they do n't do people any harm - they 're not blind , they 're not going to fly into your hair and they only eat insects .
protected species " they 're not going to chomp on your ankles .
they 're completely safe and they 're very friendly little animals . "
the bats , which have a wingspan of about seven inches , are protected species , meaning it is illegal to disturb them , which makes checking numbers difficult .
however , at one quarry at buckfastleigh , there are an estimated 1,200 animals in the area 's limestone caves .
english nature is now working with landowners to ensure good conditions for the greater horseshoes in devon 's major roosts .

for aspiring poet jo burns , it was the internet that prompted her to turn her " scribblings " into " something more solid " .
the 20-year-old from northampton clicked on website scriberazone out of curiosity - and found its mixture of contemporary music and verse far removed from the " stuffy and old-fashioned " image with which poetry is burdened .
now , countless poems later , she has swapped her career as a recruitment consultant for work as a shop assistant to give her more time for her art , and hopes to get her verse published in a book .

she said : " when i started doing it i never thought , ' i 'm going to write a poem ' .
" it 's just a way of processing life and translating that into something solid . "
although most of her inspiration comes from everyday experiences , she began jotting down her thoughts a few years ago after she suffered from kidney failure .
" that made me reflect on my life - i was thinking , it could all be over by tomorrow . "
nonetheless , miss burns says she likes to write with " a little bit of wit " .
new audiences " the stereotype of poetry is that it involves a lot of heavy experiences .
" i think the internet 's brought poetry to a new audience - it 's breaking down that whole image of old men sat in libraries . "
miss burns ' poetry was described by mr johnson , who founded scriberazone in 1999 , as simply " one person 's thoughts put in a beautiful way . "
he encourages people to submit their work but warns that unlike many , his site only picks the best .
" there are a lot of sites out there for angst-ridden 13-year-olds from california . "
' quite challenging ' on 31 october , scriberazone will be hosting the fourth ' words and beats ' evening of live readings plus mellow music at the poetry café in london 's covent garden .
" we 're trying to reach people who are happy to go clubbing .
" even though some of the music they listen to may be quite challenging , they recoil from poetry .
" but the philosophy behind the scriberazone is that everybody 's got something poetic in them . "

" i love communicating , " he said .
" i like the directness of poetry - in a few words you can send someone from happiness to tears - i thrive on it . "
the 33-year-old has made poetry his profession , having moved to london and given up his day job running a magazine distribution business five years ago .
but he is well aware that not everyone shares his enthusiasm - in fact , just 0.4 % of all consumer book buys in 2001 were poetry .
adisa uses his work to inspire schoolchildren a spokesman for books marketing limited said the figures , which come from a survey of 7,000 nationally representative homes , meant that about 1.5 million poetry books are sold annually .
" this figure sometimes goes up - for example when the nation 's favourite poem book is released every few years , or when a film like four weddings and a funeral features a poem , " the spokesman said .
" wh auden books flew off the shelves after stop the clocks , cut off the telephone was read out during the film 's funeral scene , " he added .
but for many people poetry remains something they left behind them at school .
griff rhys jones has fronted the nation 's favourite poem adisa thinks this is because of how it is taught - he has bad memories of secondary english lessons .
" you 're asked to dissect the poem - ' look on line 3a and see why it is there , dissect the metaphor ' they tell you .
" they do n't put any passion into it and it puts you off . "
but his work with children has convinced him this problem can be remedied - he finds them to be " switched on to the rhyming and rhythm " .
adisa has found that it is easy engage the youngsters ' interest .
although he is also a fan of shakespeare and william blake , he uses hip hop stars such as fugees lead singer lauryn hill to kick off his workshops .
the poet also thinks rap is also a great way to engage the children 's interest , citing the " intelligent rapper " krs-1 as his all-time favourite .
adisa has performed his poetry around london " song lyrics , rap and poetry are part of the same family , " he added .
adisa has recently been working with special needs children at the school attended by murdered schoolboy damilola taylor in peckham , south london .
he obviously loves working with them , and led workshops set up by the charity springboard .
anna guyer , who works at the charity , said the 50 children benefited hugely from working with adisa .
" he 's six feet five tall and incredibly charismatic - the kids thought he was great , " she said .
' guns and knives ' " children who are often at the bottom of the class get one-to-one attention , which gives them a huge confidence boost .
" we need to think of things to motivate kids to help them want to learn - poetry allows them to think differently and express themselves on paper . "
springboard also allows children to write poems about life in the inner city .
" we ask them to put all the things they would like to take out of the world into a box they 'll never see again , " said ms guyer .
" they put in guns and knives - it helped them to talk and write poetry about their environment . "
' achievement ' several of the poems were put into a book - something which gave them a " great sense of achievement " .
adisa is convinced that this is the way forward for poetry - for children to be inspired from a young age , so they develop a love of poetry .
but his last word goes to urging a wide a cultural agenda for poetry to reach its biggest audience , adding that rather than just bury their nose in a book , people should " go to readings - give readings - that 's the real way in to poetry " .

eighty-seven employees at the caernarfon plant were dismissed after striking over pay and conditions put forward by the company 's american owner , craig smith .
but mr smith alleges a computer shipping password had been deliberately changed , meaning goods destined for australia could have ended up in germany but were spotted in time .
the former workers have picketed the gates of the plant every day since they walked out 18 months ago .
giving evidence , mr smith denied he had said to tgwu official tom jones on the second day of the strike : " you 've got them out , how are you going to get them back in ? "
mr smith also alleged safety instructions on machinery had been taken down on the last shift , ahead of temporary staff being brought in .
he claimed most unions at the plant had been willing to accept the new pay offer , but the tgwu had caused problems .
mr smith denied claims that relations with the workers and unions had deteriorated when he took over running the plant in 2000 .
it is also alleged he made no attempt to negotiate with the workers when they began striking before dismissing them .
caernarfon mp hywel williams has led a campaign to support the strikers and said he hoped the tribunal was the " beginning of the end " of the strike .
the hearing in liverpool is the latest stage in a dispute with management at the plant .
friction dynamics has come in for criticism from former plaid cymru leader and caernarfon am dafydd wigley and bill morris , leader of the transport and general workers ' union .
the workers ' plight was eased slightly at christmas last year when local businesses clubbed together to throw a festive party for the sacked staff .
mr williams said the workers had the backing of other politicians and the local community .
' just outcome ' " this long-running strike has affected the whole community and has won support from workers throughout the country .
" plaid cymru has been proud to support the workers every step of the way , but the silence from some quarters has been loudly heard .
" it is now essential that members of all parties ensure that they support the strikers through this final stage and join with them in securing a just outcome . "
the legal industrial dispute started in april last year .
but two days after unanimously voting against the changes , which included the introduction of a four-day week without overtime , the workers were sacked and replaced with lower paid staff .
last year , craig smith , the american owner of the plant , managed to retain control of the factory under an arrangement he reached with a group of creditors , who were suing him in a multi-million dollar fraud case .
