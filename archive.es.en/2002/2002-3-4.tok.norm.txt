the firm , which filed for bankruptcy in mid-september , is now preparing to auction off its assets .
the list includes 133 planes , 10 million spare parts , terminals and other buildings , including its melbourne headquarters .
until the middle of last week , the sale of ansett to businessmen lindsay fox and solomon lew was on course .
but the pair pulled out of the deal last wednesday .
british billonaire richard branson , one of a handful of firms previously reported to be interested in reviving ansett , said his discount airline virgin blue would look to employ up to one-third of ansett 's 3,000 staff .
although ansett has been kept flying by its administrators , but a deal to rescue it as a going concern now seems impossible .
government dodges the blame the australian government has shrugged off allegations that it was to blame for the failure .
the government 's refusal to make major financial concessions lay behind the decision of mr fox and mr lew to walk away .
transport minister john anderson insisted the government made every effort to help resurrect the airline , but said the fox-lew deal would have cost hundreds of millions of taxpayers ' dollars .
" the government was left in no doubt we were being asked to consider very large amounts of money , " he said .
the fox-lew consortium wanted the government to underwrite a 65 % load factor , meaning support payments should bookings drop below 65 % of capacity .
other concessions included relief from withholding tax on aircraft lease payments for five years , and accelerated depreciation allowances .
rivals remain calm meanwhile , australia 's remaining airlines insisted that they would not be unduly exploiting the gap in the market left by ansett .
both virgin and main carrier qantas vowed to keep air fares competitive , and australia 's competition watchdog denied that it was seeking to cap qantas ' ticket prices .
qantas said it did not expect a quick profit boost from the demise of ansett .
" it certainly wo n't have any difference on the bottom line this financial year because we 've factored in the fact that they were going to be very weak competition for the next three months , " qantas chief executive geoff dixon told the nine network 's business sunday programme .

after just 10 days of gathering data , the mars odyssey spacecraft has found significant quantities of frozen hydrogen located near the southern polar region .
researchers say that the hydrogen is most likely due to substantial quantities of ice , although the amount of ice can not be quantified yet .
william boynton , of the university of arizona , us , said : " if this is confirmed , it is fantastic .
there is the equivalent of at least several percent water south of 60 degrees latitude . "
for many years , scientists have speculated that near-surface water may exist on mars .
there is evidence that water had flowed on its surface in vast quantities in the distant past and there is some evidence that it has done so far more recently .
experts delighted now , the gamma ray spectrometer instruments on board mars odyssey have made the first direct measurements that confirm there are significant amounts of hydrogen and probably water - just beneath the surface .
these instruments have detected just the type of signal expected from a large amount of ice .
" we are delighted with the quality of data we 're seeing , " said dr steve saunders , odyssey project scientist .
" we will use it to build on what we have learned from mars global surveyor and other missions .
now , we may actually see water rather than guessing where it is or was .
" with the thermal images , we are able to examine surface geology from a new perspective . "
the researchers have determined the amount of hydrogen in the soil by two different techniques .
one relies on the ability of hydrogen to slow down , or moderate , neutrons and the other relies on the fact that hydrogen can absorb a neutron and then emit a gamma ray of characteristic energy .
scientists have seen both of these effects in the initial data from the mars odyssey spacecraft .
the first maps produced by this data indicate that there are substantial amounts of hydrogen , and by inference water ice , on mars .
detailed assessment a map of the southern hemisphere of mars from the equator at the outer edge to the south pole shows water ice marked as blue .
it indicates that all areas south of 60 degrees south latitude could contain large amounts of ice .
over the next few months , scientists will make a more detailed assessment of the data .
mars odyssey will also continue to collect new data over the next couple of years , which should allow researchers to make more detailed maps .
these will show where and how much ice is present on mars , as well as maps of other elements and minerals .
dr jim garvin , lead scientist of the mars exploration program at nasa , said : " these preliminary odyssey observations are the ' tip of the iceberg ' of the science results that are soon to come , so stay tuned . "

a report from scottish engineering suggests that while the picture remains bleak , a growing number of firms are making optimistic noises about the future .
the trade body 's review says the upsurge in confidence is particularly apparent in medium-sized general engineering companies and those supplying the oil and gas industries .
firms feeling optimistic are starting to invest in new equipment again , prompting industry leaders to think the worst might be over .
the electronics sector is still struggling however , there remain areas of concern .
the electronics and electrical goods sectors are still very much in the doldrums with no sign of change .
but scottish engineering takes heart from the fact that training in the sectors has continued , so that firms are ready to compete for orders when the market starts to improve again .
the report from the independent body , which has been in existence in various guises since 1865 and has more than 400 member companies , coincides with the release of another upbeat study .
advisory firm bdo stoy hayward 's monthly report said businesses were standing firm against economic pressures , with large companies leading economic growth .
large firms registered an increase in business confidence , which should breathe life into smaller firms , the report said .
and manufacturing benefited from a decrease in the value of sterling and the rallying of the euro , bdo said .
douglas mcwilliams , chief executive of the centre for economic and business research , said : " modest economic growth will help bring about an increase in output and optimism , particularly in the small business sector .
" we expect the business community to keep a watchful eye on inflationary pressures , but they are unlikely to cause a downturn . "
