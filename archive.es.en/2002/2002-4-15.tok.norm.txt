sir edward george , the governor of the bank of england , has placed the loss of control over interest rates as a major reason behind the uk 's reluctance to adopt the euro .
britons were also sceptical over the level of regulation in other parts of the european union , sir edward told a seminar in spain .
but he called europe 's single currency a " fantastic success " and praised as an " absolute triumph " the introduction of notes and coins .
his comments came as union leader roger lyons prepared to calls for reforms to the uk 's own interest rate regime , to ensure more regional input in rate decisions .
key dilemma sir edward , explaining why the uk was still outside the euro , said britons had yet to be convinced that the benefits of adopting the currency were sufficient to warrant abandoning control over interest rates .
if britain were to adopt the euro , the uk would cede control over interest rates to the european central bank , which sets a common rate for all eurozone nations .
" the real question for the uk is whether the one-size-fits-all monetary policy suits all of the participating countries , " sir edward said .
he questioned whether the eurozone had sufficient balancing economic factors for the single interest rate policy to succeed in the long term .
" if it were to produce tensions , then because there 's less fiscal transferability across the euro zone than at the national level , because there 's less labour mobility at this stage of the evolution of europe , then those problems could be serious . "
economists largely credit the commonality of tax regimes , and the willingness of workers to move state , for the success of the dollar in the us .
' too rigid ' sir edward also warned of britons ' concerns at the level of intervention in other eu countries into some economic factors , such as labour markets .
" the need for ... improvements to improve flexibility of goods , labour and capital markets within europe is the area where i think there 's a great deal more work to be done , " sir edward said .
such restrictions were holding back economic growth , and partly explained the weakness of the euro against the us dollar , he added .
the us 's reluctance to intervene had led to a perception that the country was in a better position to achieve productivity gains .
sir edward said the ability to achieve productivity improvements was " terribly important in terms of the exchange rate relationship " .
union demand the bank of england 's own interest rate regime will come under fire later on monday , when roger lyons , general secretary of amicus , will urge reforms to the rate-setting monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- .
committee members are " out of touch " with manufacturing , mr lyons will say , urging the inclusion of regional experts on the mpc .
" changing the remit of the mpc will relieve some of the pressure on the profit margins of uk exporters and save thousands of jobs in scotland and the north of england , " mr lyons will tell the scottish tuc congress in perth .

the blast is believed to be the third assassination attempt on the hardline right-winger who looks set to win colombia 's leadership elections next month .
at least 13 people were injured when the roadside bomb was detonated by remote control as mr uribe velez 's armoured car left a campaign stop at a public market in the caribbean coast city .
the bbc correspondent in colombia 's capital , bogota , said suspicion for the attack has fallen immediately on the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- which detests mr uribe velez and has twice tried to kill him .
initially police had said the bomb had been hidden on a bus .
but they later said the bus had been caught in the blast when a bomb under a bridge was detonated as mr uribe 's convoy drove over it .
the candidate appeared on television shortly after the attack to say he was unhurt .
" it must have been a very powerful explosive because i was travelling in the most heavily armoured kind of vehicle , and the vehicle was destroyed , " he said .
" but thank god , here we are , talking . "
politicians kidnapped the attack came three days after suspected farc guerrilla kidnapped 12 state legislators from an assembly meeting in the western city of cali by posing as bomb squad officers helping to evacuate them .
troops are still looking for the politicians , believed to be being held in mountains outside the city .
violence has been rising in colombia since february when the government ended a three-year peace process with farc .
death threats april 2002 : bus bomb in barranquilla january 2002 : snipers plan shooting september 2001 : bible-bomb plot foiled mr uribe velez acknowledged the state of the country but called on his supporters to show " calmness , patience and stability in the face of these acts " .
he said : " colombia needs governments with authority to rein in violence .
" this is what happens to colombians every day . "
he has threatened an all-out war against the rebels should he become president .
last january police arrested two snipers in the northern city of medellin who said they were planning to assassinate mr uribe velez .
in september , four alleged farc members were arrested in a plot to put a suitcase containing bibles stuffed with explosives at a favourite meeting place of mr uribe velez in bogota .
running for president of colombia can be deadly .
during the 1990 campaign , three candidates were assassinated by drugs traffickers and right-wing paramilitaries .
mr uribe velez , a 49-year-old oxford and harvard-educated lawyer , claims there have been 15 attempts on his life .

sir edward george , the governor of the bank of england , has placed the loss of control over interest rates as a major reason behind the uk 's reluctance to adopt the euro .
britons were also sceptical over the level of regulation in other parts of the european union , sir edward told a seminar in spain .
but he called europe 's single currency a " fantastic success " and praised as an " absolute triumph " the introduction of notes and coins .
his comments came as union leader roger lyons prepared to calls for reforms to the uk 's own interest rate regime , to ensure more regional input in rate decisions .
key dilemma sir edward , explaining why the uk was still outside the euro , said britons had yet to be convinced that the benefits of adopting the currency were sufficient to warrant abandoning control over interest rates .
if britain were to adopt the euro , the uk would cede control over interest rates to the european central bank , which sets a common rate for all eurozone nations .
" the real question for the uk is whether the one-size-fits-all monetary policy suits all of the participating countries , " sir edward said .
he questioned whether the eurozone had sufficient balancing economic factors for the single interest rate policy to succeed in the long term .
" if it were to produce tensions , then because there 's less fiscal transferability across the euro zone than at the national level , because there 's less labour mobility at this stage of the evolution of europe , then those problems could be serious . "
economists largely credit the commonality of tax regimes , and the willingness of workers to move state , for the success of the dollar in the us .
' too rigid ' sir edward also warned of britons ' concerns at the level of intervention in other eu countries into some economic factors , such as labour markets .
" the need for ... improvements to improve flexibility of goods , labour and capital markets within europe is the area where i think there 's a great deal more work to be done , " sir edward said .
such restrictions were holding back economic growth , and partly explained the weakness of the euro against the us dollar , he added .
the us 's reluctance to intervene had led to a perception that the country was in a better position to achieve productivity gains .
sir edward said the ability to achieve productivity improvements was " terribly important in terms of the exchange rate relationship " .
union demand the bank of england 's own interest rate regime will come under fire later on monday , when roger lyons , general secretary of amicus , will urge reforms to the rate-setting monetary policy committee -lrb- mpc -rrb- .
committee members are " out of touch " with manufacturing , mr lyons will say , urging the inclusion of regional experts on the mpc .
" changing the remit of the mpc will relieve some of the pressure on the profit margins of uk exporters and save thousands of jobs in scotland and the north of england , " mr lyons will tell the scottish tuc congress in perth .

uribe velez : alleged links with right-wing paramilitaries at least 13 people were injured when the roadside bomb was detonated by remote control as mr uribe velez 's armoured car left a campaign stop at a public market in the caribbean coast city .
the bbc correspondent in colombia 's capital , bogota , said suspicion for the attack has fallen immediately on the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- which detests mr uribe velez and has twice tried to kill him .
initially police had said the bomb had been hidden on a bus .
but they later said the bus had been caught in the blast when a bomb under a bridge was detonated as mr uribe 's convoy drove over it .
the candidate appeared on television shortly after the attack to say he was unhurt .
" it must have been a very powerful explosive because i was travelling in the most heavily armoured kind of vehicle , and the vehicle was destroyed , " he said .
" but thank god , here we are , talking . "
politicians kidnapped the attack came three days after suspected farc guerrilla kidnapped 12 state legislators from an assembly meeting in the western city of cali by posing as bomb squad officers helping to evacuate them .
troops are still looking for the politicians , believed to be being held in mountains outside the city .

he said : " colombia needs governments with authority to rein in violence .
" this is what happens to colombians every day . "
he has threatened an all-out war against the rebels should he become president .
farc guerrillas posed as bomb squad officers to kidnap 12 legislators in cali last january police arrested two snipers in the northern city of medellin who said they were planning to assassinate mr uribe velez .
in september , four alleged farc members were arrested in a plot to put a suitcase containing bibles stuffed with explosives at a favourite meeting place of mr uribe velez in bogota .
running for president of colombia can be deadly .
during the 1990 campaign , three candidates were assassinated by drugs traffickers and right-wing paramilitaries .
mr uribe velez , a 49-year-old oxford and harvard-educated lawyer , claims there have been 15 attempts on his life .
he employs 120 bodyguards .

at a public meeting in caerau , maesteg , residents were keen to show support for the victims of alan beshella , 52 , who was imprisoned after harassing shopkeeper mohammed nawaz .
it is not right that a community is tainted because they have the misfortune to have someone like beshella living there jeff hurford , bridgend coalition against racism mr nawaz had planned to leave caerau after the incident , but announced last week that he had been persuaded to stay in the area by local people .
organisers hoped the monday night meeting would support the nawaz family , and also discuss ways of tackling racism .
the meeting came as beshella nears the end of his prison term for racially aggravated harassment , after serving half of his three-month sentence .
a spokesman from the community hoped the former klansman would not move back to caerau .
" he is not welcome back , " said jeff hurford of the bridgend coalition against racism .
" it is not right that a community is tainted because they have the misfortune to have someone like beshella living there . "
mohammed nawaz has opted to stay in the area mr hurford also added that there will not be any protests by anti-racist campaigners when beshella is released from prison .
beshella , a self-confessed ku klux klan member , was imprisoned after he was found guilty of racially-aggravated assault on the basis of psychological injury .
at beshella 's trial in february , magistrates in port talbot heard how the 52-year-old had joined the ku klux klan while living in california , earning the title grand dragon before moving to the south wales valleys 13 years ago .
they were told that beshella used the terrorist attacks of 11 september as an excuse to visit mr nawaz in his shop and to question him about his religious beliefs .
overwhelming support he was sentenced in march at cardiff crown court , where the judge said his aggressive questioning and menacing comments had put the nawaz family in fear .
south wales police have told the nawaz family that beshella will be released from cardiff prison on 21 april .
it is understood that he intends to return to his home in caerau .
mr nawaz said he will stay in the area , after residents asked him not to leave , unless he suffers from any repeat of the abuse .
