nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .
the city authorities have responded with a package of drastic cuts , which have already led to the closure of a wave of cultural treasures , schools , sport stadiums and kindergartens - just the kind of social infrastructure that knake-werner finds so crucial for fighting poverty in the first place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- official site of the city of berlin 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .
but schiel thinks the german government is placing too much emphasis on supporting research .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .
but schiel thinks the german government is placing too much emphasis on supporting research .
" what is required first is investment in industry to have plants up and running , to develop technology on a real scale rather than spending money for plans on paper .
the unfortunate reality is that we have no real plants to show potential investors " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the german federal environment ministry includes government 's environmental policies , agenda of renewable energies and press releases on promoting solar energy 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .
but after years in the slumps , manchester is evolving into a vibrant 21st century city .
despite its problems – an unemployment rate still double the british average , and memories of the ira bomb blast which destroyed much of the city centre in 1966 – residents have put many of these troubles behind them .
" a catalyst for focusing energies " architect libeskind sees the imperial war museum north as " a catalyst for focusing energies , both entrepreneurial and spiritual , and moulding them into a creative expression " .
" it is the cultural dynamo transforming the past into the new millenium .
the importance of this act of construction is underscored by the recreation of the entire trafford region – urban regeneration , job creation , tourist spending " .
indeed , with libeskind ’ s striking new museum , manchester ’ s battered city landscape has seen significant change .
joining the dramatic shell of this war museum are numerous other examples of the facelift the former industrial city has undergone in the past six years – including the new millenium bridge , the lowry art gallery and the urbis museum .
the urbis museum , which tells the stories of the world ’ s greatest conurbations using the latest in high tech multimedia , rises above surrounding buildings like a huge steamer made of metal and glass .
the lowry gallery , described by culture secretary chris smith as " a major centre for the performing arts which will provide jobs and help regenerate the area socially and economically " hopes to attract two million visitors a year .
built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .
these new architectural faces , shimmering above the city ’ s disused docks , are a far cry from the grim days when manchester was marked by industrial decay and the gloom of recession .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .
but schiel thinks the german government is placing too much emphasis on supporting research .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.07.2002 poverty study a further blow to " poor " berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless people camping on the streets - a common sight in berlin the first detailed study on poverty has come up with some startling results – every eighth citizen in the cash-strapped german capital is poor . it ’ s not uncommon to stumble upon young people begging at subway stations in berlin .
nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .
the city authorities have responded with a package of drastic cuts , which have already led to the closure of a wave of cultural treasures , schools , sport stadiums and kindergartens - just the kind of social infrastructure that knake-werner finds so crucial for fighting poverty in the first place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- official site of the city of berlin 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .
the city authorities have responded with a package of drastic cuts , which have already led to the closure of a wave of cultural treasures , schools , sport stadiums and kindergartens - just the kind of social infrastructure that knake-werner finds so crucial for fighting poverty in the first place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- official site of the city of berlin 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .
but after years in the slumps , manchester is evolving into a vibrant 21st century city .
despite its problems – an unemployment rate still double the british average , and memories of the ira bomb blast which destroyed much of the city centre in 1966 – residents have put many of these troubles behind them .
" a catalyst for focusing energies " architect libeskind sees the imperial war museum north as " a catalyst for focusing energies , both entrepreneurial and spiritual , and moulding them into a creative expression " .
" it is the cultural dynamo transforming the past into the new millenium .
the importance of this act of construction is underscored by the recreation of the entire trafford region – urban regeneration , job creation , tourist spending " .
indeed , with libeskind ’ s striking new museum , manchester ’ s battered city landscape has seen significant change .
joining the dramatic shell of this war museum are numerous other examples of the facelift the former industrial city has undergone in the past six years – including the new millenium bridge , the lowry art gallery and the urbis museum .
the urbis museum , which tells the stories of the world ’ s greatest conurbations using the latest in high tech multimedia , rises above surrounding buildings like a huge steamer made of metal and glass .
the lowry gallery , described by culture secretary chris smith as " a major centre for the performing arts which will provide jobs and help regenerate the area socially and economically " hopes to attract two million visitors a year .
built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .
these new architectural faces , shimmering above the city ’ s disused docks , are a far cry from the grim days when manchester was marked by industrial decay and the gloom of recession .

built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .
these new architectural faces , shimmering above the city ’ s disused docks , are a far cry from the grim days when manchester was marked by industrial decay and the gloom of recession .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.07.2002 war and conflict in manchester großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imperial war museum north is the new landmark on manchester 's skyline daniel libeskind ’ s striking imperial war museum north in manchester was opened by the queen this week , marking the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in one of europe ’ s largest industrial cities . only a decade ago , manchester ’ s skyline was marked by its numerous factory chimneys .
today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .
but after years in the slumps , manchester is evolving into a vibrant 21st century city .
despite its problems – an unemployment rate still double the british average , and memories of the ira bomb blast which destroyed much of the city centre in 1966 – residents have put many of these troubles behind them .
" a catalyst for focusing energies " architect libeskind sees the imperial war museum north as " a catalyst for focusing energies , both entrepreneurial and spiritual , and moulding them into a creative expression " .
" it is the cultural dynamo transforming the past into the new millenium .
the importance of this act of construction is underscored by the recreation of the entire trafford region – urban regeneration , job creation , tourist spending " .
indeed , with libeskind ’ s striking new museum , manchester ’ s battered city landscape has seen significant change .
joining the dramatic shell of this war museum are numerous other examples of the facelift the former industrial city has undergone in the past six years – including the new millenium bridge , the lowry art gallery and the urbis museum .
the urbis museum , which tells the stories of the world ’ s greatest conurbations using the latest in high tech multimedia , rises above surrounding buildings like a huge steamer made of metal and glass .
the lowry gallery , described by culture secretary chris smith as " a major centre for the performing arts which will provide jobs and help regenerate the area socially and economically " hopes to attract two million visitors a year .
built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .
these new architectural faces , shimmering above the city ’ s disused docks , are a far cry from the grim days when manchester was marked by industrial decay and the gloom of recession .

today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .
but after years in the slumps , manchester is evolving into a vibrant 21st century city .
despite its problems – an unemployment rate still double the british average , and memories of the ira bomb blast which destroyed much of the city centre in 1966 – residents have put many of these troubles behind them .
" a catalyst for focusing energies " architect libeskind sees the imperial war museum north as " a catalyst for focusing energies , both entrepreneurial and spiritual , and moulding them into a creative expression " .
" it is the cultural dynamo transforming the past into the new millenium .
the importance of this act of construction is underscored by the recreation of the entire trafford region – urban regeneration , job creation , tourist spending " .
indeed , with libeskind ’ s striking new museum , manchester ’ s battered city landscape has seen significant change .
joining the dramatic shell of this war museum are numerous other examples of the facelift the former industrial city has undergone in the past six years – including the new millenium bridge , the lowry art gallery and the urbis museum .
the urbis museum , which tells the stories of the world ’ s greatest conurbations using the latest in high tech multimedia , rises above surrounding buildings like a huge steamer made of metal and glass .
the lowry gallery , described by culture secretary chris smith as " a major centre for the performing arts which will provide jobs and help regenerate the area socially and economically " hopes to attract two million visitors a year .
built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .
these new architectural faces , shimmering above the city ’ s disused docks , are a far cry from the grim days when manchester was marked by industrial decay and the gloom of recession .

today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .
but after years in the slumps , manchester is evolving into a vibrant 21st century city .
despite its problems – an unemployment rate still double the british average , and memories of the ira bomb blast which destroyed much of the city centre in 1966 – residents have put many of these troubles behind them .
" a catalyst for focusing energies " architect libeskind sees the imperial war museum north as " a catalyst for focusing energies , both entrepreneurial and spiritual , and moulding them into a creative expression " .
" it is the cultural dynamo transforming the past into the new millenium .
the importance of this act of construction is underscored by the recreation of the entire trafford region – urban regeneration , job creation , tourist spending " .
indeed , with libeskind ’ s striking new museum , manchester ’ s battered city landscape has seen significant change .
joining the dramatic shell of this war museum are numerous other examples of the facelift the former industrial city has undergone in the past six years – including the new millenium bridge , the lowry art gallery and the urbis museum .
the urbis museum , which tells the stories of the world ’ s greatest conurbations using the latest in high tech multimedia , rises above surrounding buildings like a huge steamer made of metal and glass .
the lowry gallery , described by culture secretary chris smith as " a major centre for the performing arts which will provide jobs and help regenerate the area socially and economically " hopes to attract two million visitors a year .
built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .
these new architectural faces , shimmering above the city ’ s disused docks , are a far cry from the grim days when manchester was marked by industrial decay and the gloom of recession .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .
but schiel thinks the german government is placing too much emphasis on supporting research .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .

nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.07.2002 poverty study a further blow to " poor " berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : homeless people camping on the streets - a common sight in berlin the first detailed study on poverty has come up with some startling results – every eighth citizen in the cash-strapped german capital is poor . it ’ s not uncommon to stumble upon young people begging at subway stations in berlin .
nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.07.2002 world ’ s tallest solar chimney going up down under großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reaching up to the sky - a prototype of the proposed solar station to be built in mildura , australia advocates of renewable energy may want to look towards the australian outback : that ’ s where a german engineering firm is building the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station . the skyline of the small town of mildura in northern victoria in the rugged australian outback is about to change drastically .
over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .
but schiel thinks the german government is placing too much emphasis on supporting research .
" what is required first is investment in industry to have plants up and running , to develop technology on a real scale rather than spending money for plans on paper .
the unfortunate reality is that we have no real plants to show potential investors " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the german federal environment ministry includes government 's environmental policies , agenda of renewable energies and press releases on promoting solar energy radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .
but schiel thinks the german government is placing too much emphasis on supporting research .
" what is required first is investment in industry to have plants up and running , to develop technology on a real scale rather than spending money for plans on paper .
the unfortunate reality is that we have no real plants to show potential investors " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the german federal environment ministry includes government 's environmental policies , agenda of renewable energies and press releases on promoting solar energy radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .
but after years in the slumps , manchester is evolving into a vibrant 21st century city .
despite its problems – an unemployment rate still double the british average , and memories of the ira bomb blast which destroyed much of the city centre in 1966 – residents have put many of these troubles behind them .
" a catalyst for focusing energies " architect libeskind sees the imperial war museum north as " a catalyst for focusing energies , both entrepreneurial and spiritual , and moulding them into a creative expression " .
" it is the cultural dynamo transforming the past into the new millenium .
the importance of this act of construction is underscored by the recreation of the entire trafford region – urban regeneration , job creation , tourist spending " .
indeed , with libeskind ’ s striking new museum , manchester ’ s battered city landscape has seen significant change .
joining the dramatic shell of this war museum are numerous other examples of the facelift the former industrial city has undergone in the past six years – including the new millenium bridge , the lowry art gallery and the urbis museum .
the urbis museum , which tells the stories of the world ’ s greatest conurbations using the latest in high tech multimedia , rises above surrounding buildings like a huge steamer made of metal and glass .
the lowry gallery , described by culture secretary chris smith as " a major centre for the performing arts which will provide jobs and help regenerate the area socially and economically " hopes to attract two million visitors a year .
built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .
these new architectural faces , shimmering above the city ’ s disused docks , are a far cry from the grim days when manchester was marked by industrial decay and the gloom of recession .

it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .
but after years in the slumps , manchester is evolving into a vibrant 21st century city .
despite its problems – an unemployment rate still double the british average , and memories of the ira bomb blast which destroyed much of the city centre in 1966 – residents have put many of these troubles behind them .
" a catalyst for focusing energies " architect libeskind sees the imperial war museum north as " a catalyst for focusing energies , both entrepreneurial and spiritual , and moulding them into a creative expression " .
" it is the cultural dynamo transforming the past into the new millenium .
the importance of this act of construction is underscored by the recreation of the entire trafford region – urban regeneration , job creation , tourist spending " .
indeed , with libeskind ’ s striking new museum , manchester ’ s battered city landscape has seen significant change .
joining the dramatic shell of this war museum are numerous other examples of the facelift the former industrial city has undergone in the past six years – including the new millenium bridge , the lowry art gallery and the urbis museum .
the urbis museum , which tells the stories of the world ’ s greatest conurbations using the latest in high tech multimedia , rises above surrounding buildings like a huge steamer made of metal and glass .
the lowry gallery , described by culture secretary chris smith as " a major centre for the performing arts which will provide jobs and help regenerate the area socially and economically " hopes to attract two million visitors a year .
built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .

today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .
but schiel thinks the german government is placing too much emphasis on supporting research .

today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .
but after years in the slumps , manchester is evolving into a vibrant 21st century city .
despite its problems – an unemployment rate still double the british average , and memories of the ira bomb blast which destroyed much of the city centre in 1966 – residents have put many of these troubles behind them .
" a catalyst for focusing energies " architect libeskind sees the imperial war museum north as " a catalyst for focusing energies , both entrepreneurial and spiritual , and moulding them into a creative expression " .
" it is the cultural dynamo transforming the past into the new millenium .
the importance of this act of construction is underscored by the recreation of the entire trafford region – urban regeneration , job creation , tourist spending " .
indeed , with libeskind ’ s striking new museum , manchester ’ s battered city landscape has seen significant change .
joining the dramatic shell of this war museum are numerous other examples of the facelift the former industrial city has undergone in the past six years – including the new millenium bridge , the lowry art gallery and the urbis museum .
the urbis museum , which tells the stories of the world ’ s greatest conurbations using the latest in high tech multimedia , rises above surrounding buildings like a huge steamer made of metal and glass .
the lowry gallery , described by culture secretary chris smith as " a major centre for the performing arts which will provide jobs and help regenerate the area socially and economically " hopes to attract two million visitors a year .
built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .
these new architectural faces , shimmering above the city ’ s disused docks , are a far cry from the grim days when manchester was marked by industrial decay and the gloom of recession .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .
but schiel thinks the german government is placing too much emphasis on supporting research .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .
but schiel thinks the german government is placing too much emphasis on supporting research .
" what is required first is investment in industry to have plants up and running , to develop technology on a real scale rather than spending money for plans on paper .
the unfortunate reality is that we have no real plants to show potential investors " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the german federal environment ministry includes government 's environmental policies , agenda of renewable energies and press releases on promoting solar energy 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .

nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .

nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .
the city authorities have responded with a package of drastic cuts , which have already led to the closure of a wave of cultural treasures , schools , sport stadiums and kindergartens - just the kind of social infrastructure that knake-werner finds so crucial for fighting poverty in the first place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- official site of the city of berlin 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .
but after years in the slumps , manchester is evolving into a vibrant 21st century city .
despite its problems – an unemployment rate still double the british average , and memories of the ira bomb blast which destroyed much of the city centre in 1966 – residents have put many of these troubles behind them .
" a catalyst for focusing energies " architect libeskind sees the imperial war museum north as " a catalyst for focusing energies , both entrepreneurial and spiritual , and moulding them into a creative expression " .
" it is the cultural dynamo transforming the past into the new millenium .
the importance of this act of construction is underscored by the recreation of the entire trafford region – urban regeneration , job creation , tourist spending " .
indeed , with libeskind ’ s striking new museum , manchester ’ s battered city landscape has seen significant change .
joining the dramatic shell of this war museum are numerous other examples of the facelift the former industrial city has undergone in the past six years – including the new millenium bridge , the lowry art gallery and the urbis museum .
the urbis museum , which tells the stories of the world ’ s greatest conurbations using the latest in high tech multimedia , rises above surrounding buildings like a huge steamer made of metal and glass .
the lowry gallery , described by culture secretary chris smith as " a major centre for the performing arts which will provide jobs and help regenerate the area socially and economically " hopes to attract two million visitors a year .
built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .
these new architectural faces , shimmering above the city ’ s disused docks , are a far cry from the grim days when manchester was marked by industrial decay and the gloom of recession .

nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .
the city authorities have responded with a package of drastic cuts , which have already led to the closure of a wave of cultural treasures , schools , sport stadiums and kindergartens - just the kind of social infrastructure that knake-werner finds so crucial for fighting poverty in the first place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- official site of the city of berlin 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .
the city authorities have responded with a package of drastic cuts , which have already led to the closure of a wave of cultural treasures , schools , sport stadiums and kindergartens - just the kind of social infrastructure that knake-werner finds so crucial for fighting poverty in the first place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- official site of the city of berlin 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.07.2002 war and conflict in manchester großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imperial war museum north is the new landmark on manchester 's skyline daniel libeskind ’ s striking imperial war museum north in manchester was opened by the queen this week , marking the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in one of europe ’ s largest industrial cities . only a decade ago , manchester ’ s skyline was marked by its numerous factory chimneys .
today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .

today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .

today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .
but after years in the slumps , manchester is evolving into a vibrant 21st century city .
despite its problems – an unemployment rate still double the british average , and memories of the ira bomb blast which destroyed much of the city centre in 1966 – residents have put many of these troubles behind them .
" a catalyst for focusing energies " architect libeskind sees the imperial war museum north as " a catalyst for focusing energies , both entrepreneurial and spiritual , and moulding them into a creative expression " .
" it is the cultural dynamo transforming the past into the new millenium .
the importance of this act of construction is underscored by the recreation of the entire trafford region – urban regeneration , job creation , tourist spending " .
indeed , with libeskind ’ s striking new museum , manchester ’ s battered city landscape has seen significant change .
joining the dramatic shell of this war museum are numerous other examples of the facelift the former industrial city has undergone in the past six years – including the new millenium bridge , the lowry art gallery and the urbis museum .
the urbis museum , which tells the stories of the world ’ s greatest conurbations using the latest in high tech multimedia , rises above surrounding buildings like a huge steamer made of metal and glass .
the lowry gallery , described by culture secretary chris smith as " a major centre for the performing arts which will provide jobs and help regenerate the area socially and economically " hopes to attract two million visitors a year .
built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .
these new architectural faces , shimmering above the city ’ s disused docks , are a far cry from the grim days when manchester was marked by industrial decay and the gloom of recession .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .
but schiel thinks the german government is placing too much emphasis on supporting research .

at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .

nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.07.2002 war and conflict in manchester großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the imperial war museum north is the new landmark on manchester 's skyline daniel libeskind ’ s striking imperial war museum north in manchester was opened by the queen this week , marking the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in one of europe ’ s largest industrial cities . only a decade ago , manchester ’ s skyline was marked by its numerous factory chimneys .
today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .
but after years in the slumps , manchester is evolving into a vibrant 21st century city .
despite its problems – an unemployment rate still double the british average , and memories of the ira bomb blast which destroyed much of the city centre in 1966 – residents have put many of these troubles behind them .
" a catalyst for focusing energies " architect libeskind sees the imperial war museum north as " a catalyst for focusing energies , both entrepreneurial and spiritual , and moulding them into a creative expression " .
" it is the cultural dynamo transforming the past into the new millenium .
the importance of this act of construction is underscored by the recreation of the entire trafford region – urban regeneration , job creation , tourist spending " .
indeed , with libeskind ’ s striking new museum , manchester ’ s battered city landscape has seen significant change .
joining the dramatic shell of this war museum are numerous other examples of the facelift the former industrial city has undergone in the past six years – including the new millenium bridge , the lowry art gallery and the urbis museum .
the urbis museum , which tells the stories of the world ’ s greatest conurbations using the latest in high tech multimedia , rises above surrounding buildings like a huge steamer made of metal and glass .
the lowry gallery , described by culture secretary chris smith as " a major centre for the performing arts which will provide jobs and help regenerate the area socially and economically " hopes to attract two million visitors a year .
built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .
these new architectural faces , shimmering above the city ’ s disused docks , are a far cry from the grim days when manchester was marked by industrial decay and the gloom of recession .

today , the skyline of the world 's oldest industrial city is dominated by what looks like a huge aluminium fin .
this striking landmark architecture belongs to manchester ’ s new imperial war museum north , designed by the internationally acclaimed architect daniel libeskind .
the museum , which was informally opened to the public on july 3 , and was officially opened this week by the queen , is the fifth branch of the imperial war museum in london .
it is the first building in britian built by libeskind , the polish-born american architect known for his striking jewish museum in berlin .
perched on the waterfront next to a working flour mill on the industrial estate trafford park , this building is a visionary symbol of the effects of war .
its mission is to cover conflicts - especially those involving britain and the commonwealth - from the first world war to the present day .
it seeks to " provide for , and to encourage , the study and understanding of the history of modern war and ' war-time experience . "
based on the concept of a world shattered by conflict , the museum is made up of three seperate buildings – three interlocking shards representing conflict on land , air and water and which stand for a fragmented globe reassembled .
visitors enter the museum through a bunker-like entrance and can take a lift up a 55-metre high " air shard " , climbing past the criss-crossing beams of the perimeter wall to walk along a platform perched precariously above the water – an unnerving experience , designed by the architect to make visitors feel the precariousness of life that is destroyed in modern warfare .
down below , the curved earth shard houses the attractions of the main museum , including a harrier jump jet , a 1982 trabant car from former east germany and a field gun which fired the first shell from the british flanks back in wwi .
in addition a 360-degree audio-visual show draws on the museum 's photograph and sound archives , which chronicle the impact of conflicts in which british and commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914 .
exterior vs. interior despite the museum ’ s sizeable collection , however , it has not been left uncriticised .
similar to the jewish museum in berlin , the exhibits are easily overshadowed by the building ’ s striking architecture .
" with most museums , the experience begins internally " , bbc arts presenter mark lawson said on a discussion panel earlier this month .
" this is trying to offer two , the exterior and the interior one " .
alkarim jivani , editor at ´ the arts magazine time out , said the exterior of the war museum works much better than the interior .
" i thought the problem with the museum was that by comparison it was flat and dimensional " , he said , after visiting the building .
british journalist alison pearson called the museum " a caring sharing war museum " , saying she thought the exhibits , such as the parka worn by an iraqi soldier in the gulf war and a cheerful letter from a british soldier writing home saying " we took out five tanks and our apc ’ s this morning , pretty good , eh " were amazing juxtapositions , but that it lacked " testerone and aggression " .
city of birth of european industry the opening of the imperial war museum north in trafford park marked the end of a six-year reconstruction programme in the area and heralds the change manchester has undergone in the last ten years .
in the 18th century , the hitherto remote and inconspicuous town of manchester attracted world attention due to its industrial success , especially in the textile industry .
the surrounding region profited from the industrial development of the city , and grew rapidly as a result .
the red brick factory and its chimmneys coughing up filthy , black smoke , became its hallmark .
but by the 1950s , northern england 's textile industry was struggling to compete with cheaper foreign imports .
and since then , manchester began to go slowly but surely downhill .
but after years in the slumps , manchester is evolving into a vibrant 21st century city .
despite its problems – an unemployment rate still double the british average , and memories of the ira bomb blast which destroyed much of the city centre in 1966 – residents have put many of these troubles behind them .
" a catalyst for focusing energies " architect libeskind sees the imperial war museum north as " a catalyst for focusing energies , both entrepreneurial and spiritual , and moulding them into a creative expression " .
" it is the cultural dynamo transforming the past into the new millenium .
the importance of this act of construction is underscored by the recreation of the entire trafford region – urban regeneration , job creation , tourist spending " .
indeed , with libeskind ’ s striking new museum , manchester ’ s battered city landscape has seen significant change .
joining the dramatic shell of this war museum are numerous other examples of the facelift the former industrial city has undergone in the past six years – including the new millenium bridge , the lowry art gallery and the urbis museum .
the urbis museum , which tells the stories of the world ’ s greatest conurbations using the latest in high tech multimedia , rises above surrounding buildings like a huge steamer made of metal and glass .
the lowry gallery , described by culture secretary chris smith as " a major centre for the performing arts which will provide jobs and help regenerate the area socially and economically " hopes to attract two million visitors a year .
built by architect michael wilford , this building has the curved window panels of a cruise liner and a conical " funnel " complete with portholes and rigging .
these new architectural faces , shimmering above the city ’ s disused docks , are a far cry from the grim days when manchester was marked by industrial decay and the gloom of recession .

over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .
" but the most promising thing in australia is that people are looking for renewable energy and are willing to invest in it because it ’ s simply much more environment-friendly " , he says .
such a large-scale " no greenhouse gas " project would also give a huge boost to the australian government ’ s target of producing 9,500 gigawatt hours of electricity from renewable energy by 2010 .
too much research , less practical reality in germany ?
germany also has a plan to clean up its energy sources , with a commitment to switching to 15 percent renewable energy by 2015 .
earlier this year , german environment minister jürgen trittin announced that the government was pumping 10 million euro through 2003 into research and development projects on solar thermal power stations .
but schiel thinks the german government is placing too much emphasis on supporting research .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.07.2002 world ’ s tallest solar chimney going up down under großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reaching up to the sky - a prototype of the proposed solar station to be built in mildura , australia advocates of renewable energy may want to look towards the australian outback : that ’ s where a german engineering firm is building the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station . the skyline of the small town of mildura in northern victoria in the rugged australian outback is about to change drastically .
over the next few years , a gigantic concrete chimney will rise and dwarf the numerous fruit orchards and rivers in the thinly-populated region , surpassing even the petronas towers in kuala lumpur in sheer height .
though it sounds almost surreal , the ambitious project - the world ’ s largest commercial solar thermal power station - is firmly rooted in reality .
or rather in solar energy .
the nuts and bolts of the plant it ’ s the brainchild of professor jörg schlaich and his structural engineering firm schlaich bergermann and partner in stuttgart and their melbourne-based partner , environmission . together they plan to build a gigantic solar plant that will draw on the tried and tested principles of the greenhouse , the chimney and the turbine .
the plant will consist of a massive circular greenhouse solar collector at the base of the tower , which will be about five kilometres wide and would almost fit into the playing surface of the famed melbourne cricket ground .
the sun ’ s radiation would heat the body of air under the collector ’ s roof made of semi-transparent glazed material .
the warm air would be sucked by the giant tower through its chimney-like structure , and the movement of the air in turn would drive 32 wind turbines and thereby generate electricity .
a tower that reaches into the sky wolfgang schiel , partner in the stuttgart-based engineering firm , told dw-world that the solar tower needs to be enormous because the " efficiency of the plant is directly proportional to the height of the tower .
the higher the tower , the more electricity it can produce " .
at its planned height of 1 kilometer -lrb- .62 mile -rrb- and a diameter of 170 metres , the solar tower will have wind speeds of 54 kilometres per hour that will produce an estimated 200 megawatts of electricity – enough to supply 200,000 households per year , says schiel .
construction on the solar power station is expected to begin by mid 2003 and the plant is expected to be up and running by 2005 .
solar station for a steep price " the whole power station is being built at an estimated cost of $ 800 million australian " , says schiel .
that ’ s about 450 million euro – no mean price .
" price is the most important factor in the solar energy business " , he says .
he estimates that the production costs for a solar energy plant on this scale is about 20 percent higher than a coal-fired plant .
" the basic question for success will be the cost – it will be about 8 australian cents or 4,5 european cents per kilowatt " .
this price , however , will almost certainly deter under-developed countries - desparately in need of cleaner energy sources - from investing in solar power . " in ghana for instance , the government is only interested in getting the cheapest electricity , no matter if they ’ re polluting coal-based plants , " schiel says .
" renewable energy doesn ’ t stand a chance " .
australia getting closer to renewable energy target australia , with its abundance of sunshine and open spaces , provides fertile ground for such a gigantic solar energy project , according to schiel .

nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .

nor is it difficult to see that the city has a high rate of homeless people – just a visit to the central train station bahnhof zoo is enough .
but despite the common knowledge that berlin counts among the poorer cities in germany , the first comprehensive study on berlin ’ s social fabric has sent shock waves through the capital by shedding light on the true extent of the poverty in the city .
on wednesday , the social senator of the city , heidi knake-werner of the former communist party -lrb- pds -rrb- announced the sobering results of the study " poverty and social inequality in berlin " .
poverty defined by level of income the study adopts the definition of poverty laid down by the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- – those living on less than half the average income of a region are considered " poor " .
following that definition , it concludes that every eighth berliner is affected by " relative poverty " and lives on less than half of the average monthly income of 1,092 euros -lrb- $ 1,093.49 -rrb- for berlin – that means a single person living on 546 euros a month is considered " poor " .
about 435,000 people live in poverty in berlin – that makes for 12.8 percent of the city ’ s population of about 3.5 million .
families with several children , single parents and residents without a school diploma or education and foreigners in berlin are hit the hardest . particularly striking is the news that almost every fourth child in berlin -lrb- 23.6 percent -rrb- is poor .
poor children in the city ’ s west make for 28 percent , substantially higher than the 16.4 percent of poor children in eastern berlin .
the study also shows that the number of people living on welfare in berlin make for 7.3 percent of the city 's population , much higher than the national rate of 3.5 percent .
better educational and family policies needed knake-werner , speaking at a press conference after releasing the maze of statistics and figures , blamed the high levels of poverty on rising unemployment in the city , growing numbers of children and poor educational standards .
" the city needs better educational and family policies that would allow careers and bringing up children to go hand in hand , for instance more part-time jobs and all-day care for children " .
she warned against combating the problem with more state hand-outs .
" financial support from the state can only help temporarily .
and those who accept social welfare , don ’ t automatically fall below the poverty line " , she said .
the study has also uncovered deep economic differences between different districts of the city .
specifically it shows that in the former communist eastern parts of the city , just 10.6 percent people live below the poverty line as opposed to 14.2 percent in the west .
even the differences in income aren ’ t as pronounced in the east as they are in the west .
one reason , according to knake-werner , is the much higher percentage of foreigners living in the western parts of the city .
she spoke in favour of developing social infrastructure in the worst-affected city districts to help people with low incomes .
berlin in the throes of financial crisis the study couldn ’ t have come for a worse time for berlin .
the city is reeling under a mountain of debts estimated at around 40 billion euro , which caused the collapse of the conservative-social democrat government last year .
it has also been plagued by a string of bank scandals , most notably losses incurred by the bank " bankgesellschaft berlin " , in which the government has a 57 percent stake .

"
we all need to be a lot more cynical about these so-called prize draws " consumer minister melanie johnson the department of trade and industry is urging people to be wary of these letters .

the dti wants consumers to alert the office of fair trading to suspected scams .
bogus letters " every day thousands of us receive letters telling us we are the ' lucky winners ' of a prize draw or competition , " said consumer minister melanie johnson .
" we are told we should send off money or make a purchase to receive a prize but the chances of seeing that money again , let alone the promised reward , are remote . "
the letters are often written on official looking paper , and in persuasive language , telling people they 're lucky winners and just need to send a cheque to claim their prize .
such payments , which are sometimes as much as £ 1,000 are described as administration costs .
the oft , which investigates the scams , says millions of people respond , believing their prize money will more than cover the cost of the so called administration fee .
but in most cases , their prize money never arrives .
trading standards officials should be particularly suspicious if the letters have been sent from abroad or if the prize money is in a foreign currency .
ms johnson added : " we all need to be a lot more cynical about these so-called prize draws .

some sequoias are up to ten metres wide at their base they are using water-carrying aircraft and helicopters to prevent the flames reaching the centuries-old trees in the sequoias , north of los angeles .
a 45-year-old woman who was cooking hotdogs when her campfire blew out of control is thought to be to blame for the blaze .
she was arrested at her home as flames rapidly devoured the tinder-dry brush , their progress fuelled by erratic winds .
two hundred more people have now been evacuated from their homes in addition to the 1,000 who have already been forced to flee .
no rain the wildfire is now just a couple of kilometres from the sequoias , some of which are more than a 100 metres high and 10-metres wide .

" more than 100 giants between 300 and 1,300 years old are threatened , and hundreds of other smaller sequoias are in danger as well , " said jennifer combs , spokeswoman for the us forest service who described the trees as " priceless " .
the fight has been hampered by high winds and the dry conditions .
the area has not seen rain since spring .
the fire is still far from the giant sequoias located inside the smaller sequoia national park , and was not thought to be a threat to the 83.8-metre -lrb- 275-foot -rrb- general sherman tree - a tourist attraction believed to be the world 's largest tree by volume .

officers have taken two years to plan their response to the potential threats which could lie in wait for the event .
policing for the games began in november last year and its co-ordinators have drawn from the lessons learnt by the city after the ira bombing in 1996 .
the military has been drafted in to operate under police command .
there is no intelligence to suggest there is any threat to the games or the city chief inspector martin gaffney , greater manchester police preparations have not always run entirely smoothly with disagreements over how security plans should proceed between police and games organisers .
it led to a " memo of understanding " being drawn up , which was " an understanding of each other 's position " , according to chief inspector martin gaffney , co-ordinator of the games security plan .
" there is no intelligence to suggest there is any threat to the games or the city , " says mr gaffney .
" but with the work of all police forces around greater manchester , there will be greater checks on arterial roads coming into the city .
" the military will also be visible to people in the city , which is a normal part of security operations for an event of this size .
stadium patrols " they wo n't be on general patrol , but it 's fair to say they will be seen around certain venues in the city . "
head for sportscity , a mile outside the city centre , and it does not take long to spot what stepped-up security means on the street .
drains around the stadium have been sealed up to a week before the games were due to start , police officers stood 100 metres apart around the perimeter of the city of manchester stadium .
officers have also increased their vigilance in the city centre , with an operations room in piccadilly gardens .
mr gaffney says officers will not be heavy-handed .
" there 's a balance to be struck all the time .
" but we have to give a degree of confidence to the people of manchester and visitors for them to feel safe and secure , without being overbearing . "
over at manchester airport , staff are also working to ensure customers feel safe .
a smooth-running operation is how mr gaffney wants policing of the games to be remembered .

officers have taken two years to plan their response to the potential threats which could lie in wait for the event .
policing for the games began in november last year and its co-ordinators have drawn from the lessons learnt by the city after the ira bombing in 1996 .
the military has been drafted in to operate under police command . "
there is no intelligence to suggest there is any threat to the games or the city " chief inspector martin gaffney , greater manchester police preparations have not always run entirely smoothly with disagreements over how security plans should proceed between police and games organisers .
it led to a " memo of understanding " being drawn up , which was " an understanding of each other 's position " , according to chief inspector martin gaffney , co-ordinator of the games security plan .
" there is no intelligence to suggest there is any threat to the games or the city , " says mr gaffney .
" but with the work of all police forces around greater manchester , there will be greater checks on arterial roads coming into the city .
" the military will also be visible to people in the city , which is a normal part of security operations for an event of this size .
stadium patrols " they wo n't be on general patrol , but it 's fair to say they will be seen around certain venues in the city . "
head for sportscity , a mile outside the city centre , and it does not take long to spot what stepped-up security means on the street .
up to a week before the games were due to start , police officers stood 100 metres apart around the perimeter of the city of manchester stadium .
officers have also increased their vigilance in the city centre , with an operations room in piccadilly gardens .
mr gaffney says officers will not be heavy-handed .
" there 's a balance to be struck all the time .
" but we have to give a degree of confidence to the people of manchester and visitors for them to feel safe and secure , without being overbearing . "
over at manchester airport , staff are also working to ensure customers feel safe .
a smooth-running operation is how mr gaffney wants policing of the games to be remembered .

dangerous driving kills and those found guilty can expect to be severely punished bob ainsworth , home office minister the maximum penalty for causing death by dangerous driving is to rise from 10 years to 14 .
drivers caught using mobile phones behind the wheel could be given points on their licence , under a clamp down on careless driving .
but the government has stopped short of making mobile phone use while driving a specific criminal offence .
speeding offences home office minister bob ainsworth said the message of the new penalties was " dangerous driving kills and those found guilty can expect to be severely punished " .
under the proposed changes , people convicted of lesser offences , such as careless driving , speeding , and driving while uninsured could face community sentences rather than a fine if this is thought to be a " more powerful sanction " .
drivers who use mobiles could face tougher penalties a new two tier fixed penalty system for speeding offences will also be introduced - with a higher penalty for more serious offences .
disqualified drivers will get a chance to earn remission if they take up a offer of " driver retraining and improvement " .
they would pay for it themselves , but could get three points removed , or see their ban reduced by a fifth if they 're successful .
the changes follow a review of traffic penalties , carried out over the last 18 months ago .
ministers say a bill will be introduced " as soon as parliamentary time allows " , suggesting it could form part of the queen 's speech in the autumn .
' zero tolerance ' reacting to the announcement , kevin delaney , the rac foundation 's traffic and road safety manager , said : " we would support increasing maximum sentences for people who cause death by dangerous driving . "
the public do not seem to be accepting that using mobile phones while driving is wrong rospa but he said the rac foundation did not want the new two-tier speeding system to be " a way of introducing zero tolerance on speeding " .
the aa welcomed the new dangerous driving penalties but said it wanted " more consultation " on speeding .
' disappointed ' chairwoman of road traffic victims ' group roadpeace , zoe stow , said the reforms were a step in the right direction .
but she said they did not address the fact that the charges applied to motoring deaths needed a fundamental review .
the royal society for the prevention of accidents , welcomed the changes but said it was " disappointed " that using mobile phones while driving was not to be a criminal offence .
" the number of people who do make calls while driving justifies such an offence , which would help make it crystal clear that this is not safe .

attempts are continuing to find buyers for the asw plants in cardiff , following an announcement by receivers kpmg , which confirmed hundreds of steel jobs would go at the end of this month .
kpmg said 800 workers at the castle works site would be laid off unless another firm took on the site and some of the workforce .
meanwhile , the communities of llanbedr and aberporth in north and mid wales are coming to terms with the loss of more than 300 ministry of defence jobs .
as part of an mod shake-up of defence facilities , the airfield at llanbedr , near harlech , will close , with 164 job losses and a further 147 will be lost as the role of the aberporth facility changes .
the welsh assembly has suggested a role in helping find alternative employment for the axed workers , through a possible package of measures .
in cardiff , it was confirmed on wednesday that production at asw would not recommence after the firm 's two-week annual shutdown , which begins on friday , 26 july .
receivers appointed to steel manufacturer allied steel and wire -lrb- asw -rrb- confirmed that production will not restart at the castle works at tremorfa .
the welsh assembly is powerless under eu competition rules to step in and help save asw .
earlier on wednesday , the iron and steel trades confederation -lrb- istc -rrb- said receivers were handing out redundancy notices to the staff at cardiff firm asw by the end of july .
but it was understood that asw managers did not believe receivers kpmg - appointed two weeks ago - have spent long enough looking for a buyer .
but more than 100 workers at the castle nails plant - which is on the same site - will keep their jobs , following interest from other firms .
asw has blamed harsh trading conditions for its downturn , with the influx of cheap european imports and increasing costs of raw materials .
us steel tariffs kpmg said the firm 's history of trading at a loss meant it could not allow asw to continue trading .
istc general secretary michael leahy said it was " devastating news " for workers .
asw went into receivership on 10 july and the firm 's share price had dropped to just 2.5p after riding high at more than 100 times as much at its peak .
meanwhile , news from westminster confirmed the ministry of defence is to close the llanbedr military range in north wales .
there will also be a shake-up to at the west wales testing base in aberporth , which will convert into a instrumenter training range .
welsh secretary paul murphy said he understood the mod jobs would be phased out over two years .
the announcement of jobs losses on military ranges was made by dr lewis moonie , under secretary of state for defence , on wednesday afternoon .
he said the test and evaluation business had been in need of re-evaluation for years .
the cutbacks are regarded as a shock in light of the defence department 's spending review , which has seen the mod gain a 4 % budget boost .
but mr moonie said the job cuts in wales - and 100 in scotland - will deliver net savings of more than £ 300m over 25 years .
the changes , he added , would transform the test and evaluation business into " the effective , modern organisation that we require " .

strong sales of games consoles and movies and the hollywood hit spider-man have fuelled profits at the world 's largest electronics and entertainment company , sony .
as did spider-man , the movie operating profits soared to almost 52bn yen -lrb- £ 284m ; $ 447m -rrb- from just 3bn yen a year earlier while net profits doubled to almost 60bn yen .
the sharp rise in profits for the april to june quarter enabled the company to reiterate its full-year profit forecast , despite the recent rise in the strength of the japanese currency , the yen .
sony 's sales rose 5.4 % during the three months .
" despite uncertainty over the global economic situation , we achieved record sales for any first quarter , " sony said .
concerns about the future cost reductions and 13,700 job cuts during the 12 months to march this year have helped improve sony 's bottom line .
but the rising yen continues to worry analysts after it recently reached its highest level in 17 months .
this is because sony earns two thirds of its income outside japan .
on tuesday this week , sony 's share price fell to its lowest level in a year .

earlier this year , foreign secretary jack straw announced that almost a third of the country 's poppy fields had been destroyed .
but bbc radio 4 's today programme found there was little evidence that the crops were being eradicated .
and a bumper harvest suggests an increased amount of the drug on its way to the uk , where 90 % of heroin originates in afghanistan .
mr straw has congratulated the interim government on its opium eradication scheme which he said would help stem the flow of heroin into the uk .
eradication teams go to the farms armed with sticks to destroy the opium crops .
they give farmers $ 350 us for about one-fifth of a hectare of poppy .
javed akmed is a member of the security forces and was assigned to one of the eradication teams .
he told today : " they came here and made themselves look busy , but it did n't look like many people were taking the task seriously . "
only about 2 % of the crops in the area were destroyed , he said , and documents were falsified .
today reporter raphael rowe visited one of afghanistan 's major growing provinces , badakhshan .
he said it was the same story elsewhere , with the highest figure given of 10 % .
dr hasan muddin , head of one of the villages , said : " before the eradication team came , the government announced it would be strictly enforced and the farmers believed them .
" but when they came it was just a show .
" they just eradicated a few fields and gave money to a few farmers .
" the people here feel cheated and will grow poppy next year . "
dangers a military commander said better eradication required an agreed plan with alternative job opportunities offered to encourage farmers away from the lucrative cultivation of poppies .
sayed tariq , governor of badakshan , said although progress was being made , the cash incentives for eradication were counter-productive because they encouraged more farmers to grow poppy .
raphael rowe visited a small store which bought opium from farmers for about $ 300 per kg .
the opium is then sold to drug traffickers who refine it into heroin before it makes its way to britain .
thomas cronin , of the un drugs control programme , said there could be even more heroin reaching britain next year after a big harvest .
and roger howard , chief executive of drugscope , said there needed to be a " complex response " .
the rebuilding of civic institutions , better job opportunities and giving credit to farmers for growing other crops may help , he said .
according to the foreign office , 90 % of the heroin in the uk originates in afghanistan .
farmers said they realised the dangers of heroin destined for britain but the economic situation leaves them no choice .
opium poppies have a financial yield per hectare of more than 10 times that of other crops such as wheat .
the taleban had banned the growing of opium in areas under their control .

they give farmers $ 350 us for about one-fifth of a hectare of poppy .
javed akmed is a member of the security forces and was assigned to one of the eradication teams .
how the taleban kept opium poppy growth under control .
click here for more he told today : " they came here and made themselves look busy , but it did n't look like many people were taking the task seriously . "
only about 2 % of the crops in the area were destroyed , he said , and documents were falsified .
today reporter raphael rowe visited one of afghanistan 's major growing provinces , badakhshan .
he said it was the same story elsewhere , with the highest figure given of 10 % .
poppy eradication earns cash for farmers dr hasan muddin , head of one of the villages , said : " before the eradication team came , the government announced it would be strictly enforced and the farmers believed them .
" but when they came it was just a show .
" they just eradicated a few fields and gave money to a few farmers .
" the people here feel cheated and will grow poppy next year . "
dangers a military commander said better eradication required an agreed plan with alternative job opportunities offered to encourage farmers away from the lucrative cultivation of poppies .
sayed tariq , governor of badakshan , said although progress was being made , the cash incentives for eradication were counter-productive because they encouraged more farmers to grow poppy .
raphael rowe visited a small store which bought opium from farmers for about $ 300 per kg .
the opium is then sold to drug traffickers who refine it into heroin before it makes its way to britain .
the taleban deemed narcotics " un-islamic " thomas cronin , of the un drugs control programme , said there could be even more heroin reaching britain next year after a big harvest .
and roger howard , chief executive of drugscope , said there needed to be a " complex response " .
the rebuilding of civic institutions , better job opportunities and giving credit to farmers for growing other crops may help , he said .
according to the foreign office , 90 % of the heroin in the uk originates in afghanistan .
farmers said they realised the dangers of heroin destined for britain but the economic situation leaves them no choice .
opium poppies have a financial yield per hectare of more than 10 times that of other crops such as wheat .
the taleban had banned the growing of opium in areas under their control . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's raphael rowe " the one crop that spreads far and wide in this fertile land is the opium poppy " roger howard , drugscope " it 's a very complex response that we need " the bbc 's kate clarke in kabul " there have been complaints from farmers that state compensation has not been paid " click here for a guide to the world 's illegal drugs business key stories a global business decriminalisation producers coca grower 's story burma 's drug industry traffickers mexico 's drug wars drug smuggler 's story users ' club drugs ' hit miami addiction in tajikistan interactive guides drugs trade : maps and features drugs factfile talking point illegal drugs : what can be done ?

the royal united hospital in bath was one of eight acute trusts awarded no stars in the latest ratings .
the reality of the experience that they will have when they are being cared for in this hospital will be quite different from the headline news maggie crowe it failed in four target areas measuring the wait for operations , and in another measuring the effectiveness of financial management .
the hospital hit the headlines earlier in the year when it discovered more people were waiting for treatment than previously thought .
a report about the hospital 's problems led the chairman of the ruh to step down and its finance director to be suspended .
senior nurse maggie crowe said the naming and shaming of the hospital would cause unnecessary worry for patients .
she said : " that is really sad because the reality of the experience that they will have when they are being cared for in this hospital will be quite different from the headline news .
" one where staff are providing very high standards of care , and are working extremely hard against the sort of odds we are facing at the moment . "
good care dr john waldron , the hospital 's medical director , said he was " absolutely certain " his hospital was not the worst in the country .
he said the figures showed that the hospital was well above average in important categories related to treatment patients received once they were admitted .
" however , where we do fall down is that although the quality of care here is very good when patients get in , they are unfortunately waiting too long to get into the hospital . "
he said there had also been significant advances in tackling long waits since the information on which the performance ratings are based was collected .
in december , 1,400 patients were waiting more than six months for an out-patient appointment , now the figure was down to 42 .
similarly , the number of patients waiting more than 15 months for admission to hospital has fallen from 271 in may , to 39 this week .
dr waldron said the zero star rating was upsetting for staff , and might make it difficult for them to focus immediately on the problems .
" they will be very disappointed , there is no-one who would want to be in this position , but i hope that once they have recovered from this disappointment it will help them re-double their efforts so we can turn the hospital round and get a better rating next year . "
