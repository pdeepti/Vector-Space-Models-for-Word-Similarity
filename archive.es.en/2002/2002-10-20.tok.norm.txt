here is the statement in full .
on friday , september 27 , in a written communication to the army leadership , the -lrb- real -rrb- ira unit in portlaoise prison took the unprecedented step of calling the army council to stand down with ignominy .
we will not demean our struggle or provide succour to our enemies by revealing the comprehensive catalogue of evidence which has exposed this leadership .
however , we do feel duty-bound to state that this army leadership 's financial motivations far outweigh their political commitment to our struggle at this time . "
we feel we are left with no option but to withdraw our allegiance from this army leadership " ira prisoners find this morally and politically unacceptable .
we believe that the current army leadership has forfeited all moral authority to lead the -lrb- real -rrb- ira .
to date , the leadership has failed to respond to our demand .
thus we feel we are left with no option but to withdraw our allegiance from this army leadership .
we would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to republican principles and reiterate our steadfast opposition to the belfast agreement and british rule in ireland .
furthermore , in order to dispel recent , mischievous leaks to the media , we would like to state that no ira prisoners ' representative has entered negotiations with any government regarding the early release of political prisoners .

crowding onto the balcony , with its views across coogee bay , young people , mostly british and irish backpackers , down beers and soak up the afternoon sun in this sydney suburb . "
of the 14 team members who travelled to bali , only eight made it back alive " it is just a 20-minute drive from the centre of town , but the area still has the feeling of the beachside holiday resort it once was .
there are fewer backpackers and more locals in the downstairs bar .
a bank of television screens show the racing and whatever other sport is on .
a couple of pool tables are in constant use .
this is where , a few weeks ago , you would have found the coogee dolphins rugby league team celebrating their end of season .
they were about to swap the beach at coogee for the sands of bali on a post-season tour and holiday .
overwhelming grief the team is a mix of locals and young lads from country areas far away from the city , like clint thompson , the 29-year-old club president . "
bali was a small piece of paradise with a special link to australia " one of seven children from the small country town of leeton , he played for the dolphins with his three brothers .
the brothers could n't make the trip to bali because of other commitments .
but by monday afternoon , clint thompson and five other members of the coogee dolphins were dead .
the flags above the beach palace hotel were flying at half mast , and it was a very different group of team-mates , friends and family who gathered in the downstairs bar .
their grief was overwhelming .
of the 14 team members who travelled to bali , only eight made it back alive .
tragic stories clint thompson 's brothers were inconsolable .
they had lost not just their older brother , but many friends as well .
as i walked back to my home , i met a middle-aged woman .
obviously distressed and shocked , she told me her friend 's daughter had also died in the blast that tore through the sari nightclub .
it was the daughter 's 38th birthday , and she had been out celebrating .
i realised later that this was kathy salvatori , the wife of the former rugby league international craig salvatori .
he had put their two daughters aged six and nine , on a plane back to sydney so that he could continue to search through the piles of bodies in the bali morgue .
he found the body of his wife three hours later .
the couple 's story is tragically familiar .
piece of paradise they had travelled to bali with a big group of friends , some of whom had known each other since childhood .
now several of their number were dead , others severely injured . "
but the events of last weekend have brought violence to the country 's doorstep " the woman i met told me that as soon as she heard about the bomb , she had a feeling she would know someone who had died .
across the country it was the same - mothers , fathers , brothers , sisters ; partners and friends , all lost .
for years bali has been the overseas destination of choice for thousands of australians seeking a quick tropical holiday .
and while the rest of indonesia was sometimes viewed as dangerous and unstable , it seemed as though the island of bali remained untouched .
it was a small piece of paradise with a special link to australia .
but the real world has caught up with this utopian view .
and now australia 's troubled relationship with its closest neighbour indonesia is under review .
lingering resentment it has been a consistent criticism of the prime minister john howard that he has neglected the ties with indonesia .
certainly his approach is in contrast to that of his labor predecessor paul keating , who believed in active engagement with australia 's south east asian neighbours , and indonesia in particular .
mr howard has adopted a far more distanced policy .
the relationship between the two countries went particularly askew when australia led the international force in the formerly indonesian territory of east timor in 1999 .
there is still lingering resentment among some indonesians over what they see as australia 's betrayal .
the tensions between indonesia and australia surfaced again when australia complained about what was perceived as indonesian inaction over people smugglers .
but criticism from australian ministers only seemed to antagonise their indonesian counterparts .
' nowhere is safe ' now the australians are sounding more conciliatory , offering renewed military contacts and a much closer intelligence sharing operation .
back in coogee the impact of what has happened is still sinking in .
last year , when press and broadcast commentators gravely intoned that 11 september meant nothing will ever be the same again , it seemed that not many australians took much notice .
they felt australia was far enough away from the world 's hotspots not to have to worry too much .
but the events of last weekend have brought violence to the country 's doorstep , and the most common thought you hear now is , " nowhere is safe any more " .
