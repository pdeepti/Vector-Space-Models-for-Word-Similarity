mr straw is due in india in a few days ' time as part of the continuing diplomatic effort to ease tensions between india and pakistan .
" i 'm horrified by this attack on innocent civilians , " mr straw said .

mr straw was one of the first to respond to the attack , which happened late on saturday night .
there is still no official response from the indian government . "
five of my family members were killed " victims ' relative eyewitnesses said a small group of armed men disguised as hindu holy men entered the qasim nagar slum area outside jammu , first throwing grenades and then opening fire .
it is not yet known who carried out the attack , but local police say they suspect a pro-pakistan militant group .
this is the worst attack since an army camp near jammu was targeted in may , leaving more than 30 people dead .

most of the dead are thought to be hindu women and children .
a senior police official in jammu , ashok suri , said he suspected the attack had been carried out by the militant lashkar-e-toiba group .
militant groups are fighting to end indian rule in kashmir , and delhi says they are actively supported by pakistan .
pakistan has pledged to curb the infiltration of militants from its territory , but india says it is still not doing enough .
infiltration fears many in india and the international community had feared another act of violence , says the bbc 's correspondent jill mcgivering .
the loss of human life is bad enough , but the attack also jeopardises the whole international effort to keep india and pakistan from war , our correspondent says .
on friday , the united states said there had been a significant decline in infiltration by pakistani-backed militants into indian-administered kashmir .
however , the recently-appointed indian foreign minister , yashwant sinha , has said that pakistan had reneged on its promise to curb infiltration .
although both india and pakistan have stepped back from the brink , they still have huge numbers of troops massed along their common border .

the two-year-old whale , officially named a-73 but nicknamed springer , arrived at telegraph cove in british columbia after a journey of nearly 12 hours , riding semi-afloat in a special container on board a high-speed catamaran .
she will be housed in an offshore holding pen until her release into open water , when scientists hope she will be reunited with her family .
we will have done the human part .
when she leaves it is up to the whale john nightingale , vancouver aquarium " we 're certainly not going to release her until tomorrow -lrb- sunday -rrb- at the minimum , because we want to do so during daylight , " said john ford , a scientist with fisheries and oceans canada .
this is one of the first attempts to reunite a wild orca whale - as killer whales are also known - with its family group .
officials have spent weeks struggling with medical and logistical issues , and a last-minute technical hitch on friday delayed the return further .
but saturday 's operation is said to have gone smoothly .
tourist attraction the 545 kilogramme -lrb- 1,200 pound -rrb- whale has attracted international attention since being discovered swimming in the busy shipping lanes of puget sound , near seattle , in poor health .
she spent at least six months in puget sound , often swimming beside the passenger ferries going to and from seattle .
springer has been compared to keiko - star of the movie ' free willy ' scientists believe she became lost after being separated from her family group , or pod .
alternatively , she could have been rejected after her mother died .
the scientists decided to capture her to nurse her back to health and also because she was becoming too friendly with boaters in the area , raising fears that she could capsize a small vessel as she grew .
us and canadian officials worked together to arrange the relocation , which is costing upwards of $ 200,000 .
new home on saturday morning , as news helicopters circled overhead , a large crane winched the whale out of her holding pen in seattle and into a specially constructed pool on the catamaran .
during the journey , whale handlers covered springer 's upper body with wet towels and put ointment on her dorsal fin and around her blowhole to keep her skin moist .
on arrival in telegraph cove , she was lowered into another sea pen .
she will be monitored for any sign of stress or ill health before being released to hopefully reunite with her family .
sound is very important to whales , with different family pods using distinct sounds and calls to communicate .
it is hoped that springer and her family will recognise each other through these sounds .
but there is no guarantee that she will be accepted back into the tightly knit orca clan .
" we will have done the human part .
when she leaves , it is up to the whale , " said john nightingale , president of the vancouver aquarium .

a leaked draft of a government white paper revealed proposals to scrap the right of thousands of defendants to trial by jury and to abolish the double jeopardy rule - whereby suspects can not be tried twice for the same serious offence .
the home office insists the information is from an old draft of the white paper , due to be published on wednesday , and should not be taken seriously . "
the public trusts the jury system , the government needs to show it trusts the public " bar council but labour peer and lawyer helena kennedy qc described the proposals as a " wholesale assault on civil liberties " .
and prominent qc allan levy said he " felt very unhappy " about cutting down on jury trial .
" it 's a very old institution and in modern language , it is a human right of people , " he added .
campaign group liberty accused the government of " playing fast and loose " with the basic protections for fairness .
main points the independent newspaper said it had seen details of the white paper .
the main proposals are : judges to be allowed to sit alone to hear particularly complex cases or ones which could expose jurors to intimidation scrapping of the double jeopardy rule for " grave " offences clampdown on middle class professionals avoiding jury service because of work commitments magistrates to have sentencing powers doubled to cut costs in crown courts new police powers to impose bail conditions , including electronic tagging of suspects action against lawyers who use delaying tactics to win cases the government will not comment on the detail , but the home office minister , john denham , has defended the changes in principle .
" we need to reform the system right from the beginning to the end , from the original police investigation through to the court process itself , " he said .
" next week in the criminal justice white paper we 'll be looking at every part of that process and showing how it can be improved to make sure that witnesses and victims of crime feel confident in the system and that they will get a fair and just outcome . "
the plan to get tougher on people who avoid jury service was widely welcomed .
but liberal democrat shadow home secretary simon hughes said the other proposals could cut the public 's confidence in the legal system .
he said the scrapping of the double jeopardy rule would have a difficult time getting through parliament .
' trust eroded ' the bar council said in a statement : " ministers seem to be obsessed with the idea of restricting the one thing in which the public has confidence , trial by jury . "
janet paraskeva , chief executive of the law council , said that while lawyers would welcome some of the proposals , any plans to restrict jury trials should be " viewed with extreme caution " .
meanwhile , sir david ramsbotham , former chief inspector of prisons , warned there would be a significant problem if the proposals for change led to further expansion of the prison population .
" already the prison service have had to ask the police to hold them -lrb- prisoners -rrb- , which they have n't done for a number of years . "
others , including the magistrates ' association , chose not to comment because the proposals were leaked .
home secretary david blunkett has ordered a " full-scale inquiry " into the leak to the newspaper in what is being considered a " serious " breach of security .

an 11.5-metre -lrb- 38 feet -rrb- scale model of a plane intended to fly twice as fast as concorde crashed into the ground shortly after taking off at a former rocket-testing range in south australia .
the craft cost $ 80m to build it was launched on the back of a booster rocket , but as it climbed to around 100 metres it began spiralling through the air before slamming into the ground and exploding .
no one was injured - neither the model plane nor the rocket were manned , but it marks a devastating blow for scientists who had spent the past six months preparing for the test .
the aim is to develop a jet with twice the range and half the noise of concorde , which could fly passengers from japan to the american west coast in just four hours .
twice the speed of sound the team , sponsored by the japanese government 's national aerospace laboratory , had hoped that the booster rocket would carry the aircraft 20 kilometres above the launch site near woomera in south australia .
it exploded on impact the plan was then to release the model - one-tenth of the size of the planned jetliner - which would then glide back to base at more than twice the speed of sound .
but just seconds after launch , the craft flipped over and began its erratic spiral down to earth .
the cost of building the model was $ 80m and the woomera test alone , the first of four planned over the coming nine months , cost $ 7m .
cause unknown the japanese project team has made no statement about why the rocket might have crashed .
the launch had been postponed several times because the wind was too strong in the desert .
the team had planned the test for six months the project aims over the next decade to build a new range of supersonic aircraft to succeed the anglo-french concorde , which entered service in the 1970s .
the nexst1 would provide a significant improvement on concorde 's performance , researchers believe .
it would carry 300 passengers , triple concorde 's payload , with twice the flying range and a 75 % reduction of fuel emissions .
developers , who include mitsubishi and nissan , hope that the new supersonic plane will have noise levels similar to the boeing 747 .
that would mean that it would be able to operate far more widely than concorde , which is notoriously noisy . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's red harrison : " this was the first practical test " see also : 14 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific in pictures : supersonic jet crash 17 jul 01 -pipe- uk air travel : a supersonic future ? 23 apr 01 -pipe- science / nature supersonic flight ' doomed ' internet links : national aerospace laboratory of japan mitsubishi nissan the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : s korea subway inferno toll rises us plays down n korean threat thai pm says officials peddling drugs australia refuses to lift bali warning chinese official vows to end corruption japanese emperor back to work leatherbacks ' extinct in 30 years ' new project to demine tajikistan links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

those arrested were planning a demonstration in cairo 's al-azhar mosque to " stir the public against the regime " , according to police sources .
muslim brotherhood arab world 's oldest fundamentalist group began as peaceful youth group in 1920s became gradually militarised during 1930s and 1940s banned in 1954 numbers : unknown , but probably thousands particularly in southern egypt the egyptian government has accused the brotherhood - one of three main islamic groups in egypt - of encouraging islamist-inspired violence ; the brotherhood insists it is seeking to establish an islamic state using peaceful means .
the planned demonstration was in support of about 120 people arrested in alexandria at the end of june on suspicion of belonging to the organisation and causing a disturbance , sources said .
leaders executed those detained in alexandria accused the government of preventing them from casting votes in a by-election contested by two muslim brotherhood candidates .
candidates from the ruling national democratic party won the seats .
the muslim brotherhood was banned by former president gamal abdel nasser after an attempt on his life in 1954 .
thousands of its members were held without trial over a 20-year period , and some of its leaders executed .
since 1995 , hundreds of brotherhood members have been tried and scores imprisoned .
the arrests follow a call for an end to violence by leaders of one of egypt 's other islamic groups , gamaa islamiya .
the militant group , which was behind the 1997 luxor massacre in egypt in which 58 tourists died , also denounced osama bin laden and the 11 september attacks .

" we are as committed to solving this case as we were 12 months ago , " said northern territory police assistant commissioner john daulby .
the team announced on friday , however , that they were scaling back their investigation , with officers working on the case cut from 12 to seven .
ambushed mr falconio disappeared on a deserted stretch of highway on 14 july last year while on holiday with his girlfriend joanne lees .
miss lees , 27 , told police that a gunman ambushed them after flagging down their camper van as they were travelling north of alice springs .
he attacked the couple and attempted to abduct them .
miss lees was tied up but she managed to escape and hide in the bush .
an e-fit of the suspect mr falconio , 28 , has not been seen since the attack although a blood trail was found by the roadside .
police believe he has been killed .
mr daulby said : " my thoughts go out to the falconio family who have had a terrible time over the past 12 months not only dealing with what they know in their hearts is most probably the death of their son .
" i know they will not be able to find peace until this case is resolved .
" i have assured them that with the help of the public this case continues to be very much alive . "
criticism he said that although five officers were being taken off the case , " at any time the team can be boosted in numbers " .
the northern territory police had received widespread criticism for a slow start to the inquiry and delays in releasing crucial evidence .
these included the clothes worn by the victims and an e-fit of the attacker .
but a recent internal review of the police investigation cleared officers of any major mistakes .
in response , mr daulby announced two officers would be appointed later this month to audit the case .
' possible sightings ' " we are as committed to solving this case as we were 12 months ago , " he said .
" in the past year , we have had a fantastic response from diligent members of the public who continue to keep watch for possible sightings of the falconio gunman , his vehicle or any suspicious behaviour they observe . "
he said the force had received about 250 calls over the past five weeks from members of the public with information about the case . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's dominic hughes in sydney " the assumed killer has vanished " peter falconio case latest stories dna breakthrough police exonerated lees seeks damages ' no stone unturned ' the police hunt body ' not briton ' reward offered ambush relived vast search aborigines aid search in pictures the reaction mother 's nightmare father 's tears " lucky i 'm alive " press doubts tourism worries see also : 09 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific police exonerated in falconio case 11 jun 02 -pipe- asia-pacific falconio police check murder suspect 's dna 21 may 02 -pipe- uk fresh appeal for falconio suspect 09 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific australia 's greatest unsolved mystery internet links : bond university northern territory police the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : s korea subway inferno toll rises us plays down n korean threat thai pm says officials peddling drugs australia refuses to lift bali warning chinese official vows to end corruption japanese emperor back to work leatherbacks ' extinct in 30 years ' new project to demine tajikistan links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .
