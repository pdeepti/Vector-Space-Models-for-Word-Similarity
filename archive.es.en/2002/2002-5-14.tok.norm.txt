it 's thought there 'll be at least three sites on government land - in worcestershire , oxfordshire , and nottinghamshire .
but there are already local protests , against the plans .
breakfast was live at throckmorton , in worcestershire , where a former airfield looks set to be one of the accommodation centres for asylum seekers .
we talked to the former conservative home office minister , ann widdecombe .
she said : " i think large scale detention centres are good , providing they are secure . "
i 'm only half pleased , these reception centres need to be secure , otherwise we will see the asylum seekers disappear , the government hands are not tied , other countries do it , i condemn the government 's then policy of housing asylum seekers in prison , but in secure centres , that 's a different matter ... if they are not secure they will disappear if their appeal is dismissed ... i think large scale detention is good , but they need to be secure , otherwise we will continue to be a soft touch , if we are proud not to have id cards , and employer checks , we must make sure we tighten security .
we also spoke to the parish council leader steve mitchell in throckmorton .
he said : " the airfield was used in the foot and mouth episode , the local community has already done enough . "
the government has n't put any details forward .
we are concerned , it is not a right place to put the asylum seekers , it is in the middle of no where , with no support networks .
the airfield was used in the foot and mouth episode , the local community has already done enough .
the right solution is smaller communities , in areas where they can integrate and get the right ethnic support .

the other two sites , which are due to open next year , are expected to be ministry of defence land near bicester in oxfordshire and raf newton in nottinghamshire .
residents would be free to come and go except at night , when they would be expected to be on site .
some local people are anxious about plans to house large numbers of asylum seekers near them , particularly following the riot and fire which destroyed the £ 100m yarl 's wood centre .
more than 3,000 villagers in throckmorton have signed a petition objecting to a development in their area .
they claim property prices have already fallen after the land was used as a foot-and-mouth burial site .
' excluded ' proposals to educate children inside the camps have drawn fierce criticism from refugee groups , who advocate small centres in cities , so children could go to local schools .
keith best , director of the immigration advisory service , has already told one newspaper the centres would become " ghetto camps " where refugees were excluded from society .
he said : " this shows a contempt for asylum-seekers and that this government is not even prepared to view asylum-seekers as second-class citizens but as barely human . " watch / listen on this story ann widdecombe " i 'm only half pleased , providing the asylum centres are secure . "
steve mitchell " we are concerned , the area is isolated , and with no support network . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- argentina considers state land sell-off categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics tuesday , 14 may , 2002 , 05:30 gmt 06:30 uk argentina considers state land sell-off the limits on withdrawals could be removed as soon as june argentina 's president eduardo duhalde is considering whether to sell-off state property in order to compensate savers .
" the state has thousands of properties and millions of acres of land that it does n't use , " mr duhalde said .
" we should study how we can compensate people 's savings with the state 's property . "
there is a very clear political decision to end the freeze , to free depositors of this worry cabinet chief alfredo atanasof mr duhalde and his new economy minister roberto lavagna are desperate to find a way of placating the general public who face highly unpopular limits on the amount of cash they are allowed to withdraw .
the new propositions to sell state land , railroads or even furniture demonstrate just how few alternatives argentina has to help its poverty-stricken people .
they come as argentina faces a 12-hour strike by unions in protest against economic policies , and daily protests from the general public due to the difficult living conditions .
disappearing savings " there is a very clear political decision to end the freeze , to free depositors of this worry , " cabinet chief alfredo atanasof told local television .
the savings freeze has been in place for five months in order to avoid financial collapse at the country 's ailing banking system .
as well as the highly unpopular withdrawal limits , argentina 's banks were shut for a whole week earlier this month in order to try and stop a cash crunch .
while argentines have been unable to access their savings , the value of the peso has declined about 70 % against the dollar .
the freeze has also driven a wedge between the president and the supreme court , which has twice ruled it unconstitutional .
economic officials had previously been assessing whether to convert the savings into bonds but have now scrapped this idea .
scepticism but there is already some scepticism over whether the new plan to sell land would work .
" people are resigned to the fact mr duhalde does n't know what he 's doing , " said political analyst james nelson .
lifting the freeze is just one problem that the government must solve to lift its nation out of the deep recession that is expected to see the economy contract by 15 % this year .
the biggest challenge is to try and ensure the correct economic policies to uncap new aid from the international monetary fund .
and argentina must also meet an imminent $ 800m debt repayment to the world bank or have the last remaining avenue to aid cut-off .
argentina now has unemployment rates topping 25 % , and millions now rely on barter to feed and clothe their families , while shanty towns are multiplying .
the once-prosperous middle class is now protesting in the streets , and 27 people have died in food riots and other disturbances . watch / listen on this story thomas catan , ft buenos aires correspondent " this seems like another half baked idea from a government that is flailing to stay in power . "

he told the court that he had followed andersen 's own document retention policy , the rules governing what paperwork can be destroyed from any given account .
but damagingly , he said that he was well aware that under the circumstances , with enron facing a federal probe into its accounts , the policy itself was illegal .
" i obstructed justice , " he said .
" i instructed people on the -lrb- enron audit -rrb- team to follow the document retention policy , which i knew would result in the destruction of documents . "
his team and others shredded or otherwise destroyed a mountain of paperwork relating to enron after the official investigation had begun .
now , by saying that the firm 's standard document retention policy was by definition an obstruction of justice , his testimony casts doubt on evidence given earlier in the day by serving andersen staff .
contradictions the appearance of mr duncan - former head of the enron auditing team in houston - as a witness is in itself damaging to andersen , which sacked him in the hope of containing the damage .
he refused to speak before congressional hearings , but pleaded guilty to obstructing the course of justice in an unexpected u-turn in april .
that u-turn infuriated his former employers who said that he had completely changed his story after months of protesting innocence .
this week 's courtroom appearance is the first time the 43-year old accountant has explained his side of the story since the scandal erupted .
in monday 's testimony he outlined a plea bargain he agreed with prosecutors - sparing him the maximum 10-year prison term .
as part of that bargain , he signed an agreement requiring him " to tell the truth " about his time at andersen .
he began testimony late in the day , and is expected to detail what went wrong at enron and why his team approved their misleading accounts later this week .
under the counter andersen was enron 's auditor throughout the time in which it was hiding losses in off-the-books , offshore vehicles .
enron admitted it had overstated its earnings by more than $ 1bn in october 2001 .
unsurprisingly , soon afterwards staff were furiously trying to work through enron 's books - not least because earlier scandals involving andersen 's auditing of waste management inc had been settled with andersen promising not to repeat its mistakes .
one senior auditor involved , amelia ripepi , told the court earlier on monday that she had seen a 9 october e-mail from andersen lawyer warning of an impending securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- investigation into enron .
another email from the same lawyer , nancy temple , sent after the sec probe was under way , advised staff to follow document retention policy .
ms ripepi said that did not mean there was any discussion of destroying documents relating to the case .
" i do n't recall that was said or was n't said , " she told the court .
" i do n't recall that conversation . "
citing her right not to incriminate herself , ms temple has refused to give evidence . watch / listen on this story andersen 's lawyer rusty hardin " do you think you 've heard much about document destruction yet ? - i do n't think so " the bbc 's mark gregory " he -lsb- david duncan -rsb- actually said yes he had obstructed justice by ordering this cover-up " the bbc 's patrick o 'connell " the international partnership is disintegrating " the trial guilty verdict spotlight on mr duncan shredding frenzy trial gets musical starting with a bang the disintegration us workforce axed new chief merger plans fail clients flee background q & a : what now ?
