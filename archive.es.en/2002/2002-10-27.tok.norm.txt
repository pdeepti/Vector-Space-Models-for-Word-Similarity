the schools were an attempt to assimilate native children the alleged abuse took place between 1916 and 1983 .
thousands of former pupils of the schools are taking legal action to gain financial compensation .
the schools were run by the churches on behalf of the canadian government .
dark history the government is afraid that the ruling will result in it being held liable for all the compensation claims , estimated to cost billions of dollars .
around a 160,000 native children passed through the so-called residential schools in canada 's far north .
it was the canadian government 's attempt to assimilate and convert the children .
the schools were mostly dismantled in the 1970s , and they are now largely recognised as a dark and shameful part of the country 's recent history .
the anglican church , which administered 26 of the schools , said it was facing bankruptcy if the recent lawsuits were successfully pursued .
legal boomerang in his ruling last thursday , the provincial judge in alberta said there was no evidence of direct involvement in the schools by the general synod or ruling body of the anglican church .
he has ruled that only the church 's missionary society - a separate entity with little money and almost no assets - can be named in the lawsuits .
that places the legal responsibility back onto the canadian government .
the minister responsible for the claims , ralph goodale , says the government may appeal against the ruling .
" it would almost appear that one would need a higher court assessment of this , if for no other reason than simply to get national consistency , " he said .
' decades of abuse ' earlier this month , a class action lawsuit was launched on behalf of 91,000 native people who attended the schools , seeking more than us $ 8 billion from the federal government .
the anglican church of canada says it still wants to pay out fair compensation to the victims .
but as the claims get larger , it remains to be seen what can be defined as fair for what has now been widely recognised as decades of institutionalised abuse .

hundreds of survivors are still being treated for injuries sustained during the operation to seize control of the building , during which gas was pumped in to overcome the rebels .
full lists of those who died have still not been compiled by authorities , and the former hostages seem to be " under virtual arrest " , according to one moscow radio station . "
we could not save everyone - please forgive us " president vladimir putin police have asked the medical authorities to keep them in for several more days , to enable them to check whether any of the hostage-takers may be hiding among the victims .
they also want to debrief the hostages to learn more about the rebels .
more than 90 hostages and up to 50 of the rebels died in the storming and its aftermath early on saturday .
the bbc 's stephen eke in moscow said at least nine hostages with breathing problems had since died .
the interior ministry blamed their deaths on pre-existing medical conditions .
pictures shown on russian television of the inside of the theatre showed many of the female chechen rebels slumped in chairs , indicating that they might have been killed - possibly asphyxiated by the gas - in their sleep .
the authorities have not disclosed what was in the gas .
putin 's apology russian president vladimir putin made an emotional televised address late on saturday in which he apologised to families of hostages killed when the theatre was stormed .
however he said the operation had achieved the " next to impossible " by rescuing about 750 people alive .
" we proved that russia can not be brought to his knees , " he said before giving the message to the relatives and friends of those killed .
" we could not save everyone .
please forgive us . "
he thanked the members of the special forces who risked their own lives during the raid , as well as russian citizens and the international community for the support given against the " common enemy " .
earlier in the day , the russian leader visited some of the 450 freed hostages who were taken to hospital , some of whom were unconscious when rescued or seriously ill .
tactics defended interior minister boris gryzlov has launched a moscow-wide operation to catch anyone who may have helped the rebels and 30 people have been arrested .
deputy interior minister vladimir vasilyev also urged people to be vigilant and to report anyone acting suspiciously to police .
patrols are also on the streets of moscow , performing identity spot checks on buses , subways and crossroads .
however mr gryzlov has also ordered measures to prevent outbursts of anti-chechen feeling in russia , echoing a call for people not to seek revenge by president putin on friday .
gas use defended mr vasilyev defended the tactics of the russian special forces , saying that everyone in the theatre could have been killed if the mines laid by the rebels had been set off .
" the structure of the building and the threat of an explosion gave evidence that no-one would survive in the building if the explosion was powerful enough .
such is its architecture , " he said .
he said he had wanted a negotiated end , but the final attack was made necessary by the killing of hostages .
the raid came within minutes of a deadline set by the guerrillas threatening to start killing hostages if their demands were not met .
two women hostages were shot dead , sparking panic among the other captives which in turn prompted the raid .
chechen condemnation chechnya 's elected president , aslan maskhadov , said he felt responsible for those " who resorted to self-sacrifice in despair " though the rebels had nothing to do with official policy .
but , in a statement published on a chechen website , he said the " barbaric and inhumane policies " of the russian leadership were ultimately to blame and criticised the storming of the theatre .
eighteen women were among the 50 rebels killed in the palace of culture theatre which they seized to demand the withdrawal of russian forces from chechnya and an end to the war there .

full lists of those who died have still not been compiled by authorities , and the former hostages seem to be " under virtual arrest " , according to one moscow radio station .
we could not save everyone - please forgive us president vladimir putin police have asked the medical authorities to keep them in for several more days , to enable them to check whether any of the hostage-takers may be hiding among the victims .
they also want to debrief the hostages to learn more about the rebels .
more than 90 hostages and up to 50 of the rebels died in the storming and its aftermath early on saturday .
the bbc 's stephen eke in moscow said at least nine hostages with breathing problems had since died .
the interior ministry blamed their deaths on pre-existing medical conditions .
pictures shown on russian television of the inside of the theatre showed many of the female chechen rebels slumped in chairs , indicating that they might have been killed - possibly asphyxiated by the gas - in their sleep .
the authorities have not disclosed what was in the gas .
putin 's apology russian president vladimir putin made an emotional televised address late on saturday in which he apologised to families of hostages killed when the theatre was stormed .
however he said the operation had achieved the " next to impossible " by rescuing about 750 people alive .
click here to read dramatic eyewitness accounts of the rescue operation " we proved that russia can not be brought to his knees , " he said before giving the message to the relatives and friends of those killed .
" we could not save everyone .
please forgive us . "
he thanked the members of the special forces who risked their own lives during the raid , as well as russian citizens and the international community for the support given against the " common enemy " .
earlier in the day , the russian leader visited some of the 450 freed hostages who were taken to hospital , some of whom were unconscious when rescued or seriously ill .
tactics defended interior minister boris gryzlov has launched a moscow-wide operation to catch anyone who may have helped the rebels and 30 people have been arrested .
deputy interior minister vladimir vasilyev also urged people to be vigilant and to report anyone acting suspiciously to police .
patrols are also on the streets of moscow , performing identity spot checks on buses , subways and crossroads .
however mr gryzlov has also ordered measures to prevent outbursts of anti-chechen feeling in russia , echoing a call for people not to seek revenge by president putin on friday .
gas use defended mr vasilyev defended the tactics of the russian special forces , saying that everyone in the theatre could have been killed if the mines laid by the rebels had been set off .
the battle between police and rebels lasted more than one hour " the structure of the building and the threat of an explosion gave evidence that no-one would survive in the building if the explosion was powerful enough .
such is its architecture , " he said .
he said he had wanted a negotiated end , but the final attack was made necessary by the killing of hostages .
the raid came within minutes of a deadline set by the guerrillas threatening to start killing hostages if their demands were not met .
two women hostages were shot dead , sparking panic among the other captives which in turn prompted the raid .
chechen condemnation chechnya 's elected president , aslan maskhadov , said he felt responsible for those " who resorted to self-sacrifice in despair " though the rebels had nothing to do with official policy .
but , in a statement published on a chechen website , he said the " barbaric and inhumane policies " of the russian leadership were ultimately to blame and criticised the storming of the theatre .
eighteen women were among the 50 rebels killed in the palace of culture theatre which they seized to demand the withdrawal of russian forces from chechnya and an end to the war there . watch / listen on this story jonathan charles reports from moscow " the gas killed some of the hostages and many more are seriously ill " first russian radio 's aliona muchinskaya " i feel most people are absolutely unaminously supportive of what putin did " sir roderic lyne , british ambassador to russia " several hundred deaths have been averted " siege reports chaos in court how siege was ended hostages ' terror mourning in pictures key stories weathering the storm soviet methods foreign concern russia 's elite force chechen conflict rebels divided q & a : the chechen war rebels ' hostage history chechnya timeline bbc world service news in russian audio video siege drama talking point chechnya : a political solution ?

the bbc 's peter taylor broke the news to ricky , who was n't best pleased .
by peter taylor reporter , true spies i meet ricky tomlinson at a posh hotel in liverpool .
giggling girls in the lobby excitedly point him out .
unlike many mega-stars , he does n't pretend they 're not there .
" you alright then , luvs ? ' he grins and waves as he moves on to join me for a pot of tea .
builder 's tea , none of your fancy earl grey .
seems appropriate for a former plasterer on a building site . "
i know what 's right and what 's wrong and i know when someone 's getting a raw deal " ricky tomlinson ricky remains true to his roots .
his is an astonishing story ; national front supporter , trade union militant , prison hunger striker , ace banjo player and now one of the most famous faces on television .
not bad for a ' scouser ' , one of four children brought up in a two bedroomed house .
stardom 's made him rich but it has n't turned his head .
with some reluctance , he 's agreed to talk about his chequered past .
chequered is putting it mildly .
he 's only doing so because i 've told him there 's something that i know that he does n't .
he 's curious .
we sit down and chat .
he wants to know what it is .
national front before i tell him , we talk politics .
he takes me by surprise when he says he used to be a member of the national front .
" some of them were really nice guys worried about their kids and their country .
they were n't skinheads or thugs , " he says .
he 's no shame about admitting it and could n't give a monkey 's about the headlines .
i somehow feel ricky has no shame about anything .
and what about his giddy transformation from hard right to hard left ?
he says : " it was n't a blinding flash like st paul .
i did n't go to bed one night with right wing views and wake up next morning as a left winger . "
his politics are in his gut , he tells me : " i know what 's right and what 's wrong and i know when someone 's getting a raw deal . "
trade unionism and he saw the rawest of raw deals on the building sites he worked on in the early 1970s .
the conditions appalled him .
ricky says : " there were a hundred men working on the site and only a couple of chemical toilets .
they were always full to the top and alive with flies .
the fellas used to dig a little bloody hole and crap in it . "
every day someone , somewhere was killed on the sites , he says , because of the appalling working conditions .
ricky decided to do something about it .
he became a shop steward and supported a national strike in 1972 for better pay and conditions .
like his friend arthur scargill , who was doing the same for the miners at the same time , he organised flying pickets that toured building sites and persuaded non-union labour to put down their tools .
the persuasion was n't always gentle .
there was a story that coach loads of pickets arrived at one site screaming " kill ! kill ! kill ! " .
he screws up his face when i challenge him .
" this really tickles me , this word ' violence ' , " he says .
" was anyone sent to hospital ?
anyone get stitches ?
anyone get a black eye ?
none that i know of .
" how can you get 300 hairy-arsed building workers on six coaches going to these sites shouting " kill ! kill ! kill ! " and nobody gets hurt ? "
ricky insists he never used violence against anyone and , anyway , he says he always took his baby son , clifton , with him .
" i had him on my shoulders .
am i going to do that when there 's going to be violence , fighting and fisticuffs ? "
prison well , obviously not .
it just happened that the day things got rough at a building site in shrewsbury , clifton had been left at home .
ricky was arrested , charged with intimidation and affray and sentenced to two years in jail .
he 's no doubt he and his mates were set up .
" we were on trial because we 'd actually taken the bosses on .
it was a political trial and we were the scapegoats . "
he served his time , and like ira prisoners in ' long kesh ' , refused to wear prison uniform on the grounds that it branded him a criminal .
he ended up in solitary .
prison radicalised him even more than the building sites .
his bible became the early socialist polemic about the condition of the working man , the ragged trousered philanthropist .
" as i turned them pages , i was there .
that was 1906 .
it could have been 1972 . "
ricky became a working class hero and trade union martyr .
on his release , he breathed defiance and said he had no regrets .
in 1975 , he was prevented from speaking at the tuc conference , but to the consternation of the union grandees on the platform , caused chaos by yelling from the wings .
ricky does n't like being silenced .
he began to address meetings of the trotskyite workers ' revolutionary party - who 'd looked after his wife and kids whilst in prison - and seriously considered joining them .
i finally tell him what he did n't know , that special branch had a file on him .
tomlinson ' visibly stunned ' he looks surprised .
" when we were on strike , there were always rumours that we were being watched and we should be careful what we said .
it was all a bit cloak and dagger but we 'd just laugh about it . "
but this was for real and i tell him how a special branch agent within the workers ' revolutionary party , codenamed 735 , had tipped off his handler that tomlinson should be watched .
i say i 've spoken to the special branch officer concerned .
ricky looks at me intently , eyes narrowing .
i tell him that the file described him as a political thug prone to violence .
he 's visibly stunned .
his face freezes and for a moment he seems uncharacteristically lost for words .
' i 'm gobsmacked , ' he said .
' it 's untrue .
i feel violated .
it 's sickening . '
was he a subversive ?
' subversive .
my arse , ' he says .
' i love england and the people in it . '
as if to prove the point , he says he 'd once had a little boat called " the british heart " .
it was painted red , white and blue .
" i love this country more than the special branch guy who 's branded me a thug , " he says angrily and i 've no doubt he means it .
there 's silence and for a moment he seems lost in thought .
" and it 's been on them files obviously all them years , " he muses , " and i 've had no chance to redress it .
i think that 's appalling . "
i point out the file was probably destroyed ages ago .
it 's no consolation .
suddenly , strange events in his life become clearer .
he tells me that when he was in jail , his cottage in wales was burgled .
he says no windows were broken and the intruders came in through the door .
only letters and photographs were taken .
he 's never been able to work it out .
at the time he suspected special branch .
now he 's certain .
he adds : " i used to think we lived in a free society but i 'm not so bloody sure now .
if they can do it to me , they can do it to anyone .
i 'm not a subversive and definitely not a bloody thug . "
as he leaves through the lobby , the giggling girls had gone .
anyway , he probably would n't have felt like waving .

the bali attack has raised new terror fears mr ba 'asyir - who is under formal detention in his hospital bed for the alleged involvement in a spate of bomb attacks on christian churches in indonesia in 2000 - said he was willing to be questioned by the police , but that he could only be arrested by force .
he has also been linked to the militant jemaah islamiyah group , which indonesia believes is allied to al-qaeda and was behind the bali bombing on 12 october that killed almost 200 people .
doctors have said that mr ba 'asyir could be discharged from hospital on monday .
mr ba 'asyir 's statement comes as indonesia is being put under increasing pressure to tackle militants at a summit of asia pacific economic co-operation -lrb- apec -rrb- in mexico .
heads of state from the apec countries have already agreed on a range of new policies aimed at preventing terrorist attacks , and are expected to adopt a final declaration later on sunday .
ba 'sayir defiant mr ba 'asyir , who was taken to the hospital two weeks ago with respiratory problems , denies any links to al-qaeda and has not been named as a suspect in the bali attack .
bush : offered condolences over the bali bombing he also denies being a leader of the jemaah islamiah , which , he said , was a make-believe organisation .
however , he said he would allow police to question after he leaves hospital .
" i will respect the summons and will go to questioning .
but my detainment is -lsb- illegal -rsb- , " he was quoted by the associated press news agency as saying .
" the terrorist government of america and its allies have always wanted me detained . "
mr ba 'asyir comments come as us president george w bush and australian prime minister john howard have urged indonesian president megawati sukarnoputri to do more to curb militants .
during their face-to-face talks with president megawati at the apec summit , both mr bush and mr howard praised the steps indonesia has taken to fight extremists .
but they added that the country still had a long way to go .
tough security reforms at their annual summit at the mexican resort of cabo san lucas , leaders from 21 apec nations also agreed a wide range of counter-terrorist measures .
they want to put in place tough security reforms for the transport of goods , as well as cracking down on money laundering .
a special attention was paid to the trade by sea between the apec nations , which runs into trillions of dollars .
the leaders agreed to strengthen the procedures for pre-checking cargo containers to make sure they are not being used by terrorist groups .
also on the list of agreements was a commitment to tighten up the monitoring of remittances sent across the region by overseas workers and the flow of funds through charitable institutions .
both are seen as key areas of funding for militant groups across the world .
these measures will be complemented later on sunday by further counter-terrorism policies when the heads of state reveal the summit 's final declaration .
they are likely to include ambitious plans to standardise customs procedures across the apec region within the next three years .

bluetooth is a wireless technology that allows devices to communicate with each other .
because it can be used with a hands-free headset that can connect to a mobile phone even if the device is some distance away , it could be a perfect way to get around the ban .
the uk , in common with other governments around the world , is currently considering a complete ban on using mobile phones in cars .
the car manufacturers are responding and saab is already making a car with bluetooth built into the dashboard .
