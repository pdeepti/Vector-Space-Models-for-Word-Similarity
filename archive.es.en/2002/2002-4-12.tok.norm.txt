romina , a lowland gorilla at bristol zoo gardens , had congenital cataracts - cloudy lenses - in both eyes .
jenny watts , an ophthalmic surgeon from winchester general hospital , removed one and replaced it with an artificial silicone lens .
the two-hour operation was the first cataract surgery performed on an adult gorilla in europe .
during the procedure , romina was sedated and laid out on two operating tables in the veterinary department at the university of bristol .
sharon redrobe , bristol zoo gardens ' head of veterinary services , said : " as soon as romina came round from the operation we could tell that she could see .
" she immediately reached towards food without resorting to feeling her way .
" we 're delighted that the operation has been so successful and that she is having the chance to explore her surroundings and companions properly for the first time . "
artificial lens ms watts was assisted by two animal specialists , david gould , an expert on cataracts in cats and dogs , and dan holden , a veterinary anaesthetist .
the operation involved the same procedure that was used to remove a cataract from the late queen mother 's left eye at london 's king edward vii hospital in july 1995 .
an incision was made through the cornea and ultrasound used to break up the cataract .
the debris was removed , and a silicone artificial lens inserted .
whether romina 's operation is ultimately successful will not be known for another four to seven days .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- ' cracks ' in china 's three gorges dam categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : world : asia-pacific front page world africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia - from our own correspondent - letter from america uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 12 april , 2002 , 06:43 gmt 07:43 uk ' cracks ' in china 's three gorges dam a senior chinese official says cracks have appeared in the controversial three gorges hydroelectric dam being built on the yangtze river .
qian zhengying , the former minister of water resources who heads an expert group on the dam , returned from a week-long inspection of the project demanding that the cracks be " repaired fastidiously " , according to the state-controlled china daily .
more than one million people are being resettled there have been consistent rumours that the 185-metre-high -lrb- 605 feet -rrb- dam , which entails the removal of entire villages to higher ground , is being shoddily constructed , amid reports of endemic corruption in the project .
but the china daily report represents an usually frank admission that the dam has serious shortcomings and some leaders are now critical of the project .
" during the past three years , concrete placement in the project has not been first class , causing a variety of related accidents and drawbacks , though the concrete process has improved compared with previous years , " ms qian was quoted as saying .
the cracks measure a maximum 1.25 millimetres across and 2.5 metres deep , according to china daily .
the paper said cracks had also been found in the project 's permanent ship-locks and ship-lifts .
costly project the chinese government 's prestige project is hugely costly - officially it is expected to cost at least us $ 24bn but unofficial estimates say it could cost at least three times that amount .
china hopes the dam will stop devastating floods it has been bedevilled by corruption .
in 2000 , 97 officials were convicted of embezzlement from the dam fund .
activists have criticised the enforced resettlement of those whose homes lay in the 600 kilometre-long -lrb- 375 miles -rrb- area , which will form the three gorges reservoir and the loss of many historic buildings and artefacts that will be drowned .
the dam is intended to control china 's notorious flooding problem .
but engineers have questioned whether the dam will be effective , citing problems with sedimentation and the construction itself .
