the joseph rowntree foundation studied a " restorative cautions " scheme run by thames valley police since 1998 .
it said the scheme was significantly more effective than traditional cautions - where offenders are told off by officers - in stopping criminals re-offending .
it had also made a lot of difference to victims , who felt more involved in the process of justice .
thousands of cases the system has been used for offences for which the police would normally give a caution rather than prosecute - about a third of all cases which end in a criminal record .
successful scheme 1,915 meetings 12,065 victim statements re-offending rate : 14 % non-scheme re-offending rate : 28 % it involves offenders hearing about the harm their actions have caused victims , either in a meeting or through a statement .
in the scheme 's first three years 1,915 meetings took place , and there were another 12,065 cautions where offenders heard victim 's statements .
the authors analysed a final sample of 56 young offenders receiving these cautions and found only one in seven went on to be convicted or cautioned for further offences .
shame this was half the re-offending rate of about 28 % found in similar studies .
the study found the meetings helped offenders understand the effects of their crime , and induced a sense of shame in them .
you 're showing respect for the person at the same time as you 're disapproving of their behaviour dr richard young most offenders apologised to the victims , and a third of them entered into written agreements to make some kind of reparation .
however , some offenders said they had felt coerced into apologising , and were left feeling " bad " - which the report said the process was meant to avoid .
co-author dr richard young told bbc news : " they key principle here is that you 're showing respect for the person at the same time as you 're disapproving of their behaviour .
" so you 're saying to them : ' you ought to feel bad about what you did , but we 're still treating you as a good person that 's capable of reforming ' .
" it 's only if you treat people in that fair way that they 're likely to listen to what you 're saying and take responsibility for what they 've done . "
the system also helped ease victims ' concerns so they could overcome after-effects of the crime , said dr young .
serious crimes dr young said : " one victim of a serious assault told us that he had thought of the offender as an animal , but the conference made him realise the offender was just a normal person , like anyone else .
" realising that helped him to get on with his life . "
dr young said his research suggested the scheme would " work very well " with more serious crimes .
he added that the home office was currently looking at whether it was an effective way of dealing with more serious adult offences .
" we have some evidence also from canberra , australia , that -lsb- with -rsb- serious violent offences that have gone through this system , offending over the following years has actually been reduced . "

there was absolutely no reason , or need , to bring her in before this media , or that public , other than to both humiliate her and send a message to us rusty hardin , andersen attorney rusty hardin made the charge after the government called former andersen employee kate agnew to the stand on thursday afternoon to testify in the government 's obstruction of justice case against the beleaguered accountancy .
" this is the most outrageous thing i 've ever seen , " mr hardin said to a group of reporters , shortly after the government announced its decision to call ms agnew to the stand .
mr hardin was angered because ms agnew had said she would not testify in the case , invoking her fifth amendment right against self incrimination .
ms agnew was a member of the specialised andersen accounting team that worked exclusively on enron 's books .
letter of complaint mr hardin said the it was not necessary for ms agnew to appear in court to invoke her right against incriminating herself .
" today was an attempt to send a message , " mr hardin told reporters gathered outside the bob casey federal building in downtown houston following thursday 's proceedings .
" there was absolutely no reason , or need , to bring her in before this media , or that public , other than to both humiliate her and send a message to us , " he said .
that message , he insisted , was the government would resort to humiliating witnesses in order to prove its case .
he said government prosecutors had threatened three witnesses , hoping to persuade them to change their stories .
he did not name the other two witnesses .

mr hardin told reporters he intended to send a letter of complaint over prosecutors tactics to department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- late on thursday .
mr hardin was barred by district court judge melinda harmon from asking witnesses taking the stand in the case , " are you waldo ? " a not-so-subtle reference to the government 's search for criminal actions surrounding the collapse of enron .
us attorneys implored the judge to prevent mr harding from making references to the childhood game as well as other courtroom manoeuvres they felt distracted jurors .
neuhausen : enron pushed the accounting envelope those events were preceded by the testimony of benjamin neuhausen , a member of andersen 's professional standards group -lrb- spg -rrb- , which advises other andersen accountants .
mr neuhausen testified that he believed enron 's proposed accounting procedures involving certain special purpose entities -lrb- spes -rrb- " seemed like such a terrible idea " .
awaiting mr duncan also testifying on thursday was carl bass , a houston-based andersen partner who became the first member of andersen 's spg to be based outside of its chicago base - on account of enron .
mr bass was removed from his position of consulting enron 's accounting actions following complaints by richard causey , then enron 's chief accounting officer .
testimony resumes on friday .
david duncan , the government 's prize witness , is expected to testify as early as friday .
the former andersen employee led the firm 's efforts to consul enron .

" logically , it will have an adverse impact on most of the rest of the world , " said bill reinsch , president of the national foreign trade council .
australian prime minister john howard made it clear that the bill - which boosts crop and dairy subsidies by two thirds to shore up support in an election year - runs directly against the us 's professed support for freer trade .
" the farm bill is very detrimental to australia 's interests , " he said .
" we are a close ally of the us ... but that wo n't stop us complaining and campaigning in the strongest terms . "
analysts agreed that the decision would also weaken the us ' negotiating position and hold up future progress of free trade talks , not least because it comes just months after a three-year steel tariff regime to protect us steelmakers came into effect .

activists point out that the us had been a fierce proponent of free agricultural trade in last november 's world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- meeting in doha , qatar .
but us trade representative robert zoellick insisted this week that the us remained committed to free farm trade , and stressed that the european union and japan both had higher levels of subsidies than the us .
the eu has said it is considering whether to file a complaint to the wto if the bill is signed into law by mr bush .
strained relations canada 's agriculture minister described them as a " serious blow to us credibility " in global free trade negotiations .
us relations with its main trading partners are already strained by president bush 's decision to levy tariffs of up to 30 % on steel imports , a move which is being investigated by the wto .
the eu is also set to levy up to $ 4bn of tariff increases on us products in a dispute over tax subsidies to the foreign sales of us companies .
' vitality protection ' the bill proposes increasing state payouts to us farmers by 70 % and authorises the spending of $ 180bn -lrb- £ 123bn -rrb- in farm subsidies over the next 10 years .
as well as increasing aid to wheat and cotton farmers , the package diversifies farm aid to cover producers of milk , lentils , honey , chickpeas , mohair and other products .
higher farm subsidies will provide a welcome boost to the economies of key mid-western states which president bush needs to retain to win re-election in two years ' time .

but the transport secretary 's latest statement to the commons immediately came under fire from mr sixsmith , who accused mr byers of breaking an agreement not to comment further on the case . "
i have not misled the house as some have alleged " stephen byers mr sixsmith told the bbc : " i think it 's a shame that he has seen fit to tear up that agreement now and reopen that argument . "
mr byers has been accused of misleading mps by saying mr sixsmith had resigned when this was not the case .
but during his statement on thursday , the transport secretary insisted that he had made it clear during a previous statement to mps that negotiations were continuing in relation to the former bbc reporter 's position .
censure motion during a stormy commons session , mr byers said that the £ 200,000 pay-off mr sixsmith received was " in accordance with his employment rights " .
later , conservative leader iain duncan smith wrote to prime minister tony blair urging him to give the opposition space next tuesday so that it could debate a " motion of censure " against mr byers .
the motion would ask for the transport secretary 's salary to be reduced - a commons technicality - and will be debated within the next 10 days even if mr blair refuses to allow it to replace a scheduled debate on the modernisation of parliament .
meanwhile the liberal democrat 's don foster insisted that mr byers " did mislead parliament " and had failed in his job at the detr .
" the public deserves a secretary of state on whom they can rely to be clear about what 's going on , to take responsibility for his department and to provide a safe , reliable and affordable public transport system , " he said .
but mr byers - who is also secretary of state for the regions - received a boost in the form of the backing of deputy prime minister john prescott who predicted his colleague would play a major part in the next stage of the government 's plans for devolution into the english regions .
shadow transport secretary theresa may told mps that if mr byers had " a shred of decency left he would go and go now " .
but mr byers insisted : " i have not misled the house as some have alleged - all of my statements to the house have been based on the information available to me .
' incorrect ' " that is precisely why the agreed statement with mr sixsmith explicitly says that any misunderstanding over his resignation was in good faith . "
mr byers added that resignation announcement was based on an " incorrect understanding " of earlier discussions that had taken place between a senior official and mr sixsmith .
the tories say mr byers misled mps by saying mr sixsmith had resigned when he had not .
' chaos ' mr foster asked when mr byers would start taking responsibility for events in his department .
" not only the chaos which surrounds this particular issue ... but the chaos we have on our buses , roads and railways , " he said .
mr blair mounted a strong defence of mr byers on wednesday .
the row stems initially from an e-mail sent by then transport spin doctor jo moore suggesting bad news could be " buried " after the 11 september attacks .
rebuke it then escalated after reports that mr sixsmith had e-mailed ms moore to warn her not to announce bad news on the day of princess margaret 's funeral .
downing street initially said the e-mail rebuke did not exist , but later admitted an e-mail on the matter - addressed to mr byers , not ms moore - had been sent by mr sixsmith .
it was later announced that both ms moore and mr sixsmith had resigned .
the transport secretary announced both resignations on 15 february and made a commons statement on the issue 11 days later .
but mr sixsmith insisted he had not resigned .
the row was sparked again on tuesday when the transport department acknowledged mr sixsmith had been telling the truth .
