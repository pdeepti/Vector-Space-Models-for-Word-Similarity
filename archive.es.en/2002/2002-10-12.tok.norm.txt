the main topics of discussion were the current situation in israel and palestine as well as the chances of settling the iraq issue peacefully .
addressing a news conference in berlin on friday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said he took note of and respected the vote by the u.s. congress authorizing the use of force against iraq .
he added , however , that this would not change the german government 's anti-war stance as already expressed prior to the federal election in germany last month and on several occasions since then .
" we stick to our position , no ifs or buts , " fischer told solana .
" what chancellor schröder and i said concerning the iraq question prior to the general election still holds true .
there 's no reason why we should deviate from our clear and unequivocal position . "
peter struck , germany ’ s defense minister , echoed fischer ’ s stance on the issue , telling deutschlandlandfunk radio that germany would remove the six fuchs tanks currently deployed in kuwait , if the u.s. attacks iraq .
these tanks , which are used for detecting atomic , biological and chemical weapons , were positioned in kuwait to protect american installations against terrorists , not for a war against iraq , struck said .
no german isolation the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said that germany had by no means isolated itself within the european union .
in fact , he too felt it was an absolute priority to focus on getting weapons inspectors back into iraq and making intensive diplomatic efforts to resolve the iraq problem .
solana said it was unjustified to say that a war against iraq was inevitable : " i think that the debate in the united nations continues and we have to see how the situation evolves in the un .
a decision has been taken that the un is the place where this issue is going to be discussed , and let ’ s hope also a solution found . "
the question of war or peace rests strictly in the hands of the iraqi president saddam hussein , solana said .
" there is still a chance to avoid war , " he expressed , " but the responsibility is saddam hussein ’ s .
when there is a resolution , he must follow it . "
middle east solana also briefed the german foreign minister about his recent trip to the middle east and informed him at length on the prospects of a speedy implementation of the so-called " road map " for the region as envisaged by the european union .
this plan will be fine-tuned after a meeting next week in paris with russia , the united states , and the united nations .
eventually , this road map will culminate in the founding of a palestinian state by 2005 .
in the meantime , though , solana said the situation in the region was " very bad and not improving . "
" we will see by the end of the month whether we can take some steps to implement the road map ... to see whether we can help the process move forward , " solana told reporters after meeting with fischer .
the german foreign minister endorsed the eu ’ s efforts and said the european community must continue to work towards ending the violence and terror .

addressing a news conference in berlin on friday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said he took note of and respected the vote by the u.s. congress authorizing the use of force against iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.10.2002 eu challenges switzerland over bank secrecy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland : the land of alps , chocolates and tax shelters .
in its effort to tax europeans on money made from investments outside the eu , brussels is mounting pressure on switzerland to loosen its strict banking secrecy laws - and threatening sanctions . in its fight against lost revenue due to tax evasion and fraud , the eu is planning a unified system for taxing interest on savings and investments eu citizens make outside eu borders .
the law requires that by 2010 banking secrecy laws be lifted in all member countries .
thereafter , banks would be required to automatically inform the country where a customer is normally taxed of any capital yields on an account .
but the new regulations face some stiff opposition outside the eu , and in order for brussels to implement the regulations effectively , it must also bring on board a handful of countries that are less than eager to participate .
the list includes the usual countries known as havens for tax evaders , including monaco , andorra and switzerland , which all fall outside the eu 's borders .
in order to prevent investors from circumventing paying their interest taxes by investing their money outside the eu , the eu is negotiating with third countries in order to compel them to participate in the new banking information system .
accommodating switzerland in the alpine republic , banking secrecy laws are holy .
to demand that banks give out information about their customers is a step too far for the swiss .
instead , the country is offering to levy a withholding tax on accounts in question and then transfer the money to the holder 's own country .
that way , the eu would be able to collect the tax revenue it is seeking without compromising switzerland 's secrecy laws .
but the swiss also say they would only do so in cases in which criminal proceedings against a client are in place .
but so far , eu officials are n't biting .
fritz bolkestein , the eu 's commissioner for internal markets , says the offer does n't go far enough .
in addition to aiding in cases of active tax evasion and fraud , he says , the swiss should also aid eu finance authorities in the tracking of people who have " forgotten " to declare funds on their tax declarations .
but there 's also a key difference in the way switzerland and the eu handle tax evasion cases , and that makes it more difficult to reach an agreement .
technically , tax evasion is not considered a crime in switzerland - most proceedings against tax dodgers are done in civil court .
against that backdrop , the swiss have thus far strictly refused to disseminate bank account holders ' data .
eu ratchets up pressure against swiss since the end of september 2002 , an open fight has broken out between the eu and switzerland over the new regulations .
the finance ministers of the united kingdom and luxembourg , among , others , are demanding that third countries also participate in the new eu interest tax system .
bolkestein has applied additional pressure on swiss officials , even threatening the country with sanctions in other bilateral areas starting in 2010 if switzerland does not cooperate with the planned regulations .
at a recent closed-door meeting of eu ministers , bolkestein presented a list of possible measures that could be taken against the swiss , including a suspension of negotiations for future swiss participation in the schengen agreement , which eliminates border controls within the eu and some non-eu " associate " countries , like norway and iceland .
in its oct .
9 , 2002 , issue , the swiss newspaper " neue zürcher zeitung , " challenged the eu 's view in an editorial .
the paper concluded that proposal was less about creating effective europe-wide regulations for interest taxes than to " take the ground out from underneath the feet of switzerland , a successful finance center . "
in the cut-throat competition between financial capitals , some eu countries are attempting to burden investors with higher taxes and eliminate switzerland 's legal advantage as a banking center .
the paper said that bolkestein 's threat to restrict the free flow of capital between switzerland and the eu if an agreement was n't met was proof of its thesis .
kaspar villiger , switzerland 's finance minister , has said he was " astonished " that friends would threaten friends with sanctions .
and even within the eu member states , there are differing views on the best way to deal with switzerland .
both austria and luxembourg are pleading for fair dealings with the country , and have so far refused to support bolkestein 's sanctions threats . andreas hartmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

addressing a news conference in berlin on friday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said he took note of and respected the vote by the u.s. congress authorizing the use of force against iraq .
he added , however , that this would not change the german government 's anti-war stance as already expressed prior to the federal election in germany last month and on several occasions since then .
" we stick to our position , no ifs or buts , " fischer told solana .
" what chancellor schröder and i said concerning the iraq question prior to the general election still holds true .
there 's no reason why we should deviate from our clear and unequivocal position . "
peter struck , germany ’ s defense minister , echoed fischer ’ s stance on the issue , telling deutschlandlandfunk radio that germany would remove the six fuchs tanks currently deployed in kuwait , if the u.s. attacks iraq .
these tanks , which are used for detecting atomic , biological and chemical weapons , were positioned in kuwait to protect american installations against terrorists , not for a war against iraq , struck said .
no german isolation the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said that germany had by no means isolated itself within the european union .
in fact , he too felt it was an absolute priority to focus on getting weapons inspectors back into iraq and making intensive diplomatic efforts to resolve the iraq problem .
solana said it was unjustified to say that a war against iraq was inevitable : " i think that the debate in the united nations continues and we have to see how the situation evolves in the un .
a decision has been taken that the un is the place where this issue is going to be discussed , and let ’ s hope also a solution found . "
the question of war or peace rests strictly in the hands of the iraqi president saddam hussein , solana said .
" there is still a chance to avoid war , " he expressed , " but the responsibility is saddam hussein ’ s .
when there is a resolution , he must follow it . "
middle east solana also briefed the german foreign minister about his recent trip to the middle east and informed him at length on the prospects of a speedy implementation of the so-called " road map " for the region as envisaged by the european union .
this plan will be fine-tuned after a meeting next week in paris with russia , the united states , and the united nations .
eventually , this road map will culminate in the founding of a palestinian state by 2005 .
in the meantime , though , solana said the situation in the region was " very bad and not improving . "
" we will see by the end of the month whether we can take some steps to implement the road map ... to see whether we can help the process move forward , " solana told reporters after meeting with fischer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.10.2002 eu challenges switzerland over bank secrecy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland : the land of alps , chocolates and tax shelters .
in its effort to tax europeans on money made from investments outside the eu , brussels is mounting pressure on switzerland to loosen its strict banking secrecy laws - and threatening sanctions . in its fight against lost revenue due to tax evasion and fraud , the eu is planning a unified system for taxing interest on savings and investments eu citizens make outside eu borders .
the law requires that by 2010 banking secrecy laws be lifted in all member countries .
thereafter , banks would be required to automatically inform the country where a customer is normally taxed of any capital yields on an account .
but the new regulations face some stiff opposition outside the eu , and in order for brussels to implement the regulations effectively , it must also bring on board a handful of countries that are less than eager to participate .
the list includes the usual countries known as havens for tax evaders , including monaco , andorra and switzerland , which all fall outside the eu 's borders .
in order to prevent investors from circumventing paying their interest taxes by investing their money outside the eu , the eu is negotiating with third countries in order to compel them to participate in the new banking information system .
accommodating switzerland in the alpine republic , banking secrecy laws are holy .
to demand that banks give out information about their customers is a step too far for the swiss .
instead , the country is offering to levy a withholding tax on accounts in question and then transfer the money to the holder 's own country .
that way , the eu would be able to collect the tax revenue it is seeking without compromising switzerland 's secrecy laws .
but the swiss also say they would only do so in cases in which criminal proceedings against a client are in place .
but so far , eu officials are n't biting .
fritz bolkestein , the eu 's commissioner for internal markets , says the offer does n't go far enough .
in addition to aiding in cases of active tax evasion and fraud , he says , the swiss should also aid eu finance authorities in the tracking of people who have " forgotten " to declare funds on their tax declarations .
but there 's also a key difference in the way switzerland and the eu handle tax evasion cases , and that makes it more difficult to reach an agreement .
technically , tax evasion is not considered a crime in switzerland - most proceedings against tax dodgers are done in civil court .
against that backdrop , the swiss have thus far strictly refused to disseminate bank account holders ' data .
eu ratchets up pressure against swiss since the end of september 2002 , an open fight has broken out between the eu and switzerland over the new regulations .
the finance ministers of the united kingdom and luxembourg , among , others , are demanding that third countries also participate in the new eu interest tax system .
bolkestein has applied additional pressure on swiss officials , even threatening the country with sanctions in other bilateral areas starting in 2010 if switzerland does not cooperate with the planned regulations .
at a recent closed-door meeting of eu ministers , bolkestein presented a list of possible measures that could be taken against the swiss , including a suspension of negotiations for future swiss participation in the schengen agreement , which eliminates border controls within the eu and some non-eu " associate " countries , like norway and iceland .
in its oct .
9 , 2002 , issue , the swiss newspaper " neue zürcher zeitung , " challenged the eu 's view in an editorial .
the paper concluded that proposal was less about creating effective europe-wide regulations for interest taxes than to " take the ground out from underneath the feet of switzerland , a successful finance center . "
in the cut-throat competition between financial capitals , some eu countries are attempting to burden investors with higher taxes and eliminate switzerland 's legal advantage as a banking center .
the paper said that bolkestein 's threat to restrict the free flow of capital between switzerland and the eu if an agreement was n't met was proof of its thesis .
kaspar villiger , switzerland 's finance minister , has said he was " astonished " that friends would threaten friends with sanctions .
and even within the eu member states , there are differing views on the best way to deal with switzerland .
both austria and luxembourg are pleading for fair dealings with the country , and have so far refused to support bolkestein 's sanctions threats . andreas hartmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the paper said that bolkestein 's threat to restrict the free flow of capital between switzerland and the eu if an agreement was n't met was proof of its thesis .
kaspar villiger , switzerland 's finance minister , has said he was " astonished " that friends would threaten friends with sanctions .
and even within the eu member states , there are differing views on the best way to deal with switzerland .
both austria and luxembourg are pleading for fair dealings with the country , and have so far refused to support bolkestein 's sanctions threats . andreas hartmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the main topics of discussion were the current situation in israel and palestine as well as the chances of settling the iraq issue peacefully .
addressing a news conference in berlin on friday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said he took note of and respected the vote by the u.s. congress authorizing the use of force against iraq .
he added , however , that this would not change the german government 's anti-war stance as already expressed prior to the federal election in germany last month and on several occasions since then .
" we stick to our position , no ifs or buts , " fischer told solana .
" what chancellor schröder and i said concerning the iraq question prior to the general election still holds true .
there 's no reason why we should deviate from our clear and unequivocal position . "
peter struck , germany ’ s defense minister , echoed fischer ’ s stance on the issue , telling deutschlandlandfunk radio that germany would remove the six fuchs tanks currently deployed in kuwait , if the u.s. attacks iraq .
these tanks , which are used for detecting atomic , biological and chemical weapons , were positioned in kuwait to protect american installations against terrorists , not for a war against iraq , struck said .
no german isolation the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said that germany had by no means isolated itself within the european union .
in fact , he too felt it was an absolute priority to focus on getting weapons inspectors back into iraq and making intensive diplomatic efforts to resolve the iraq problem .
solana said it was unjustified to say that a war against iraq was inevitable : " i think that the debate in the united nations continues and we have to see how the situation evolves in the un .
a decision has been taken that the un is the place where this issue is going to be discussed , and let ’ s hope also a solution found . "
the question of war or peace rests strictly in the hands of the iraqi president saddam hussein , solana said .
" there is still a chance to avoid war , " he expressed , " but the responsibility is saddam hussein ’ s .
when there is a resolution , he must follow it . "
middle east solana also briefed the german foreign minister about his recent trip to the middle east and informed him at length on the prospects of a speedy implementation of the so-called " road map " for the region as envisaged by the european union .
this plan will be fine-tuned after a meeting next week in paris with russia , the united states , and the united nations .
eventually , this road map will culminate in the founding of a palestinian state by 2005 .
in the meantime , though , solana said the situation in the region was " very bad and not improving . "
" we will see by the end of the month whether we can take some steps to implement the road map ... to see whether we can help the process move forward , " solana told reporters after meeting with fischer .

the main topics of discussion were the current situation in israel and palestine as well as the chances of settling the iraq issue peacefully .
addressing a news conference in berlin on friday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said he took note of and respected the vote by the u.s. congress authorizing the use of force against iraq .
he added , however , that this would not change the german government 's anti-war stance as already expressed prior to the federal election in germany last month and on several occasions since then .
" we stick to our position , no ifs or buts , " fischer told solana .
" what chancellor schröder and i said concerning the iraq question prior to the general election still holds true .
there 's no reason why we should deviate from our clear and unequivocal position . "
peter struck , germany ’ s defense minister , echoed fischer ’ s stance on the issue , telling deutschlandlandfunk radio that germany would remove the six fuchs tanks currently deployed in kuwait , if the u.s. attacks iraq .
these tanks , which are used for detecting atomic , biological and chemical weapons , were positioned in kuwait to protect american installations against terrorists , not for a war against iraq , struck said .
no german isolation the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said that germany had by no means isolated itself within the european union .

solana said it was unjustified to say that a war against iraq was inevitable : " i think that the debate in the united nations continues and we have to see how the situation evolves in the un .
a decision has been taken that the un is the place where this issue is going to be discussed , and let ’ s hope also a solution found . "
the question of war or peace rests strictly in the hands of the iraqi president saddam hussein , solana said .
" there is still a chance to avoid war , " he expressed , " but the responsibility is saddam hussein ’ s .
when there is a resolution , he must follow it . "
middle east solana also briefed the german foreign minister about his recent trip to the middle east and informed him at length on the prospects of a speedy implementation of the so-called " road map " for the region as envisaged by the european union .
this plan will be fine-tuned after a meeting next week in paris with russia , the united states , and the united nations .
eventually , this road map will culminate in the founding of a palestinian state by 2005 .
in the meantime , though , solana said the situation in the region was " very bad and not improving . "
" we will see by the end of the month whether we can take some steps to implement the road map ... to see whether we can help the process move forward , " solana told reporters after meeting with fischer .
the german foreign minister endorsed the eu ’ s efforts and said the european community must continue to work towards ending the violence and terror .

the main topics of discussion were the current situation in israel and palestine as well as the chances of settling the iraq issue peacefully .
addressing a news conference in berlin on friday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said he took note of and respected the vote by the u.s. congress authorizing the use of force against iraq .
he added , however , that this would not change the german government 's anti-war stance as already expressed prior to the federal election in germany last month and on several occasions since then .
" we stick to our position , no ifs or buts , " fischer told solana .
" what chancellor schröder and i said concerning the iraq question prior to the general election still holds true .
there 's no reason why we should deviate from our clear and unequivocal position . "
peter struck , germany ’ s defense minister , echoed fischer ’ s stance on the issue , telling deutschlandlandfunk radio that germany would remove the six fuchs tanks currently deployed in kuwait , if the u.s. attacks iraq .
these tanks , which are used for detecting atomic , biological and chemical weapons , were positioned in kuwait to protect american installations against terrorists , not for a war against iraq , struck said .
no german isolation the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , said that germany had by no means isolated itself within the european union .
in fact , he too felt it was an absolute priority to focus on getting weapons inspectors back into iraq and making intensive diplomatic efforts to resolve the iraq problem .
solana said it was unjustified to say that a war against iraq was inevitable : " i think that the debate in the united nations continues and we have to see how the situation evolves in the un .
a decision has been taken that the un is the place where this issue is going to be discussed , and let ’ s hope also a solution found . "
the question of war or peace rests strictly in the hands of the iraqi president saddam hussein , solana said .
" there is still a chance to avoid war , " he expressed , " but the responsibility is saddam hussein ’ s .
when there is a resolution , he must follow it . "
middle east solana also briefed the german foreign minister about his recent trip to the middle east and informed him at length on the prospects of a speedy implementation of the so-called " road map " for the region as envisaged by the european union .
this plan will be fine-tuned after a meeting next week in paris with russia , the united states , and the united nations .
eventually , this road map will culminate in the founding of a palestinian state by 2005 .

mick jagger has described the group as the original manufactured pop band in an exclusive interview with bbc radio five live .
their first five uk hits were cover versions , and jagger only struck up his hit songwriting partnership with guitarist keith richards after their manager , andrew loog oldham , locked them in a room .
" we could n't write rock songs , we just wrote these crap ballads , " jagger told five live .
the stones found fame with songs written by lennon and mccartney , chuck berry and buddy holly , among others .
but oldham was afraid they would lose their appeal if they relied on covers , so locked them in a small room and told them not to come out until they had written a song .
the first tune they wrote was " a horrible song " , jagger said . "
eventually we got to grips with writing rock tunes , but it took a little time " mick jagger if that happened now , it would be dismissed as manufactured , jagger told five live .
" it was pop , and we did n't record it , because it was crap .
" we had a successful crap ballad , as tears go by , which i can say now , it 's a wonderful tune , but we did n't think it was that great at the time . "
they gave the song to marianne faithfull , who had a top 10 hit with it in 1964 .
" and we said , well , maybe it was n't that bad , " jagger said .
" -lsb- we -rsb- were these two rebellious band members and we would write nice little tunes , but sentimental stuff .
" eventually we got to grips with writing rock tunes , but it took a little time , " he said .
the first single they wrote and released , the last time , went to number one in the uk in march 1965 .
after that , the jagger and richards partnership flourished with classics like satisfaction , get off my cloud and paint it black . "
nobody has been scumbag rockers like us and lived to tell the tale " keith richards the group have just released their greatest hits to mark 40 years at the top of the business .
and they have finally shaken off the " wrinkly rocker " tag , according to guitarist ron wood .

" which is good , because we have gone through a lot in our time and survived it , and the music lives to tell the tale , and so do we .

official results -lrb- at 0800 gmt -rrb- muttahida majlis-e-amal - 45 seats pakistan muslim league-quaid-e-azam - 77 pakistan people 's party - 63 pakistan muslim league-nawaz - 14 others - 68 poll void in one constituency there will be repolling in two constituencies but a coalition of religious parties which has criticised president pervez musharraf for backing the american military campaign in afghanistan has done much better than expected , coming a strong third .
observers say the religious parties could hold the balance of power , as no one party will have a majority in the new assembly .
the pakistan muslim league quaid-e-azam , seen as supportive of general musharraf , won 77 of the 272 contested constituency seats , according to the official count .
the pakistan people 's party , aligned with former prime minister benazir bhutto - who was banned from participating - came in second with 63 seats , while the religious muttahida majlis-e-amal -lrb- mma -rrb- won 45 .
divided nation the bbc 's susannah price in islamabad says it is clear that three years of military rule by general musharraf , who seized power in a 1999 coup , have left the country divided .
traditionally , the religious parties have had trouble winning seats , but the mma 's anti-us message went down particularly well in areas bordering afghanistan , where there had been some support for the taleban .
benazir bhutto : concerns about poll rigging our correspondent says that although general musharraf has declared his full backing for the us operations , it is clear he has not taken the whole country with him .
the military leader has pledged to hand over executive control to a new prime minister , but general musharraf will retain the ability to dismiss parliament after adding five years to his term in a controversial referendum earlier this year .
human rights activists and opposition parties say this amounts to a controlled democracy and have called for him to allow the newly elected members of parliament to run the country .
' inexplicable delay ' mrs bhutto , speaking from london , questioned what her party says was an inexplicable delay in the counting of the ballots and announcing the results .
" it has been a highly controversial election and we believe there has been widespread rigging , " she said .
the party aligned with former prime minister nawaz sharif , the pakistan muslim league-nawaz , won 14 seats - and he also criticised the election .
the election is the first in pakistan for five years mr sharif , who was overthrown by general musharraf and accused of corruption , was also banned from participation .
he told reuters from saudi arabia that he had no doubt " the worst kind of rigging " was going on .
however , commonwealth election observers say the elections , held on thursday , were transparent , although they have expressed concern about allegations that government resources were used to help pro-musharraf candidates .
general musharraf promised the elections would be free and fair , but opponents have accused him of distorting the political landscape by barring two former premiers and strengthening his own powers .
' anti-american feeling ' the bbc 's world affairs correspondent mike wooldridge , who is in the pakistani capital , islamabad , says the main surprise of the election has been the performance of the islamic mma .
" people wanted a change from the past corrupt rulers and the pro-us policies of general musharraf , " said mma spokesman qazi hussain ahmed .
musharraf has promised to end military rule " the widespread anti-american feeling among the people has clearly gone in our favour and we are very happy over it , " he said .
in pakistan 's largest province , punjab , the pro-musharraf pakistan muslim league quaid-e-azam was the leader .
mrs bhutto 's party won many seats in punjab and southern sindh , while mr sharif 's supporters performed badly in their traditional stronghold in punjab .
the united states welcomed the election as " an important milestone in pakistan 's ongoing transition to democracy " .
but india 's foreign minister , yaswant sinha , said the results and the strong showing by religious parties demonstrated that general musharraf had failed to control the country 's extremists . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's susannah price " pakistan 's parliament will soon be full of fresh faces " the bbc 's lyse doucet " this was an election that mattered , one meant to put the country back on the road to civilian rule " the bbc 's zaffar abbas " this is an unprecedented event in pakistani politics " democracy challenge democracy returns ?

however , aslef has maintained there were " unacceptable strings " attached to the offer , one of which involved drivers picking up litter at stations .
a number of services between north wales and the north west of england have been cancelled .
wales and border train services have also been effected because many first north western drivers work for them .
stranded a fleet of buses have again be provided to ferry commuters for the third successive weekend walkout .
the majority of rail users in north wales will be picked up by coaches to get to the coast from chester .
however , passengers hoping to travel between wrexham and bidston , merseyside could be left stranded .
mark youngman from the rail passengers committee said the town has been hit hard .
" our main concern is that buses have not been provided on the wrexham to bidston route which means that people ca n't get over to merseyside . "
the strikes are set to continue he said many people are annoyed by the industrial action .
" we 've had general complaints about the extra amount of time that people have to travel . "
the drivers have also voted against rest-day working , which could mean 160 trains on weekdays will have to be cancelled .
not all commuters have reacted angrily to the strike .
wrexham student sian peter , regularly uses public transport .
however , she said she has mixed feelings about the industrial action .
" i think they should be allowed to protest about their wages but they should n't do it so it effects everybody else .
" i 've heard people moaning about how they are late for work because of the strikes and how they have to re-arrange their daily plan . "
the weekend strikes will continue until 24 november .

earlier this year , the 62-year-old from king 's lynn was told she would need one of her hips replaced .
faced with a 15-month wait on the nhs and struggling to cope with excruciating pain , she re-mortgaged her house to pay the £ 8,000 cost of traveling to south africa to have the operation .
she is one of an estimated 250,000 people who , disillusioned with the nhs , have dug into their own pockets this year to pay for essential medical treatment in the private sector .
mrs adams trip to cape town was effective but costly she is also the type of person the two main political parties are vying to win over with their policies for curing the ills of the nhs .
mrs adams , like the vast majority of patients , has no ideological preconditions for improving the way healthcare is delivered across the uk .
when it comes to having her second hip replaced in the months or years ahead , she simply wants to be treated quickly .
the government insists that its policies will ensure that this happens .
labour says its plans to boost spending , recruit thousands of extra doctors and to use spare capacity in the private sector will dramatically cut waiting times .
the conservatives believe that encouraging people to take out medical insurance and partially reimbursing those who opt for treatment in private hospitals will also deliver results .
clear choice for the first time in many years , the two largest parties are offering patients what appears to be a clear choice on the future direction of the health service .
labour believes the future lies in getting the nhs to make better use of the private sector .
the tories believe that the key is getting the private sector to take pressure off the nhs .
mrs adams has yet to be convinced that either set of proposals will deliver the improvements she wants .
" i know the government is spending lots of money on the nhs but i think its actually going to get worse .
it really is terrible . "
she is equally dismissive of tory plans to re-introduce tax incentives to encourage people to take out medical insurance .
" i have had chronic arthritis since i was 28 , " says mrs adams .
" i 've looked into medical insurance in the past but with a chronic condition there 's no way they will touch me . "
dr fox says his policies will offer patients choice at present , just one in eight britons has private medical cover - the lowest of any of the world 's major industrial countries .
shadow health secretary dr liam fox believes his policy will boost that number and help to reduce the " burden " on the nhs and " make way " for other patients .
the proposal marks a return to the policies of past conservative administrations .
margaret thatcher saw tax relief for people over the age of 60 who took out cover and for companies providing schemes to employees as a way of reducing demand on the nhs .
however , labour disagreed and scrapped the incentives shortly after coming to power in 1997 .
ministers said the policy provided poor value for money .
recent studies by the european commission , the independent health think-tank the kings fund and the london school of economics agree .
the insurance industry thinks differently .
according to bupa , the private sector carries out one in five of all non-emergency operations in the uk .
it estimates that the cost to the government if those patients were treated on the nhs could be as high as £ 1bn annually .
even if the value for money question is resolved , experts suggest the policy could create other difficulties .
" the problem with tax breaks is they tend to result in the private sector putting prices up , " says health economist dr jonathon shapiro .
a powerful private sector could also increase pressure on the already-overstretched health service .
" the real danger here is that the private sector will poach staff from the nhs , " says andy bell of the king 's fund .
" the nhs is no longer short of money but it is short of staff . "
financial pressure mrs adams is more supportive of the other tory proposal - to contribute towards the cost of having an operation in a private hospital .
alan milburn is scathing about the tory policies " my operation in south africa cost me £ 8,000 .
i thought about trying to get some of that money back but in the end i decided i just wanted to get better , " she says .
" but it has cost me a lot and because we 've had to re-mortgage i do feel a bit under pressure now . "
under the conservative plans , patients would receive money equal to 60 % of the estimated cost of having the operation on the nhs .
dr fox said the policy , which is based on a system introduced in finland , would give patients " a greater say about the care they have already paid for through their taxes " .
the proposal could prove popular with patients .
however , others may be harder to convince .
" it will only be of benefit to families on middle incomes , " says andy bell .
" the poorest people will not be able to benefit .
it could also result in price inflation as the private sector increases fees in the knowledge that the nhs will foot the bill . "
doctors have yet to give their verdict on the conservative proposals .
the british medical association said it would give them " detailed consideration over the next few months " but added that it would only back the policies if they benefited patients and the nhs .
public imagination some experts believe both parties need to go back to their respective drawing boards and to come up with more credible options .
" politicians are failing to come up with radical reforms , " says andrew haldenby of independent think tank reform .
" pilot schemes to allow the nhs to treat patients in the private sector or re-introducing tax relief for people who take out medical insurance are not going to catch the public 's imagination .
people are enormously dissatisfied with the nhs . "
mrs adams would appear to agree .
" the nhs was once the best in the world .
when i was in south africa they called it the third world nhs .
i do n't think the situation is going to change .
it is very sad . "

only last week the foreign office warned that taking advantage of low cost flights without travel insurance was risking financial ruin .
around 40 % of british travellers often fail to take out proper cover for short breaks overseas .
but even those of us who think we are covered may not be .
heart attack theresa and mike roynon have been nat west customers for 30 years .
in 1999 they were invited to " upgrade " their account to the bank 's advantage gold service .
for £ 6 a month they got a number of benefits including free travel insurance .
the couple have relied on it ever since .
when mike had a heart attack in greece last month , they rushed to a local private hospital , confident that their insurance policy would cover the cost .
theresa contacted the insurance company and was given a reference number for her claim .
mike was admitted and doctors started investigating his case .
but the insurance company called back and told theresa the couple were not covered as she had paid for the holiday with her advantage gold switch card instead of her advantage gold credit card .
cockroaches theresa was horrified .
" i could not take it in .
i just felt numb and sick .
" they just left us alone in a foreign country without any help .
i mean you would think you would have your passport , not nearly lost your husband " theresa had to take mike to a public hospital where the conditions were tough .

only last week the foreign office warned that taking advantage of low cost flights without travel insurance was risking financial ruin .
around 40 % of british travellers often fail to take out proper cover for short breaks overseas .
but even those of us who think we are covered may not be .
heart attack theresa and mike roynon have been nat west customers for 30 years .
in 1999 they were invited to " upgrade " their account to the bank 's advantage gold service .
nat west offers travel insurance on a number of accounts for £ 6 a month they got a number of benefits including free travel insurance .
the couple have relied on it ever since .
when mike had a heart attack in greece last month , they rushed to a local private hospital , confident that their insurance policy would cover the cost .
theresa contacted the insurance company and was given a reference number for her claim .
mike was admitted and doctors started investigating his case .
but the insurance company called back and told theresa the couple were not covered as she had paid for the holiday with her advantage gold switch card instead of her advantage gold credit card .
cockroaches theresa was horrified .
" i could not take it in .
i just felt numb and sick .
" they just left us alone in a foreign country without any help .
i mean you would think you would have your passport , not nearly lost your husband " theresa had to take mike to a public hospital where the conditions were tough .
there were cockroaches in the wards and theresa had to make a 4 hour round trip every day to bring mike clean bedding and fresh food .

in a letter to hans blix , the un 's chief arms inspector , iraq said inspectors could return on 19 october - but did not respond in detail to a list of arrangements set out by the un . "
there is only one reason why they moved this far ... and that is because of the potential threat of war " jack straw , uk foreign secretary the bbc 's un correspondent says that us and british diplomats believe the letter - signed by iraqi general amir al-saadi - falls short of what they expected .
iraq and the un have been discussing the return of arms inspectors to search for the chemical , biological and nuclear weapons that the us and britain accuse baghdad of developing .
the iraqis were replying to a letter from dr blix about the arrangements for weapons inspections agreed in vienna at the beginning of this month .
' delay and deceive ' dr blix has , however , postponed the return of the inspectors while the un security council tries to reach agreement on a new resolution on the crisis .
" we are not surprised that once again the iraqis want to delay and deceive , " said richard grenell , spokesman for the us ambassador to the un , john negroponte .
" we have had 16 resolutions and 11 years of playing this game and it is time the security council took action . "
iraq 's ambassador to the un , mohammed albouri , insisted that the letter showed that baghdad was trying to co-operate .
" the letter means we are working on all questions in good faith .
let the inspectors get back to iraq .
we do n't think there will be any problems with inspections , " mr aldouri told reuters news agency .
uk home secretary jack straw said the letter showed iraqi leader saddam hussein was backing down , faced with the threat of military action .
" just four weeks ago they -lsb- iraq -rsb- were saying they would not have the inspectors back under any circumstances , that they had no weapons of mass destruction , " mr straw told the bbc .
" there is only one reason why they moved this far , not far enough , but this far , and that is because of the potential threat of war . "
' propaganda ' meanwhile , after talks in moscow with russian president vladimir putin , uk prime minister tony blair expressed cautious optimism about russian backing for a tougher un resolution on iraq .
earlier , speaking publicly for the first time on the issue , mr putin said he did not rule out supporting a new , tougher resolution .
moscow had previously insisted there was no need for a new security council resolution on weapons inspections .
however , at a news conference following the talks , mr blair heard his host openly dismiss the uk dossier of evidence against saddam hussein as propaganda .
the chairman of the un security council , martin belinga-eboutou of cameroon , has announced that debate on a new resolution will begin on wednesday .

the 99th royal national mod is expected to attract up to 20,000 people from as far afield as austraila and north america to largs over the course of the week .
the event was launched at an opening ceremony on friday evening .
the profile of gaelic in scotland has been raised considerably in the past year mike watson tourism minister saturday 's events included a fiddlers ' rally and piping recital , while the week will also feature a range of competitions including solo singing , ceilidhs , choral and instrumental music , poetry , art , story-telling and drama .
tourism minister mike watson opened the event with a promise of £ 450,000 in extra funding for teaching gaelic in schools .
he said the money would be spent on teacher training and education in the western isles and on teaching materials .
" the profile of gaelic in scotland has been raised considerably in the past year by the work of the ministerial advisory group on gaelic , " he said .
" i am convinced these measures , together with other executive initiatives already under way , will contribute to our overall aim of securing the future of gaelic language and culture . "
gaelic culture a spokesman for the mod 's parent body , an comunn gaidhealach , said : " there is great goodwill throughout scotland for gaelic and many towns compete to stage this event .
" we are hearing much more gaelic spoken during the week but it is important that our politicians both locally and nationally also support our cause .
" many people recognise that the nation is greatly enriched by gaelic culture and would be diminished if gaelic were to die . "
the skye-born poet and writer myles campbell was crowned bard at the opening ceremony .

the person who proposed the 63-year-old author has switched allegiance to writer and broadcaster sir clement freud .
but ms greer said she had decided to press ahead with her candidacy after encouragement from students at the university , where prince william is among the undergraduates .
students will cast their votes this month ms greer , the author of the female eunuch , said : " i 'm still standing despite the machinations of the young conservative who originally approached me and evidently intended to use me as a stalking horse , " she said .
" my candidacy was originally proposed in march by two members of the student community independently .
" as soon as i was sure that i was eligible and there was no conflict with my professorship at warwick university , i accepted the nomination . "
andrew neil , the editor-in-chief of scotsman publications , is currently rector at the fife university .
" i reckon i 'm more lively than the worthy andrew neil and even , god save the mark , than clement freud , " added ms greer .
student vote " as for my feminism , the students of 2002 expect nothing less . "
students will vote for their new rector this month .
the candidates also include chris woodhead , the controversial former chief inspector of schools .
barry joss , a former post graduate student who had earlier sought to nominate weakest link presenter anne robinson , is also standing for the post .

in the hushed auditorium , the grey-haired , bespectacled man on the stage made a startling confession .
the 10 country expansion plan is mr verheugen 's most daring yet " i sometimes feel a little bit alone , " guenter verheugen told hundreds of participants at the brussels international business forum .
his plea was meant not only for the european business elite .
as enlargement enters its dramatic endgame , only 1 % of eu citizens say they are well informed about what it means .
and the commissioner in charge would like eu leaders to start spreading the message about its benefits just as tirelessly as he does .
guenter verheugen spends most of his time not in brussels , but on the road , shuttling between the 13 applicant countries and the 15 eu member states .
candidates shortlist cyprus czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia slovenia earlier this year , i joined him on a typically hectic two-day trip to slovakia , which took him from an impoverished gypsy settlement to bratislava university .
wearing a black cap and robe to receive an honorary degree , the commissioner looked remarkably like a judge .
click here to see a map of the 10 candidates indeed , an important part of his job for the last few years has been to assess how close each applicant country comes to eu standards .
but he told me he felt more like an architect or a bridge-builder .
to a great extent , the success of enlargement hangs on how skilfully he manages to bridge the gap between the interests of present member states and the hopes of the future ones .
lofty ideas born in 1944 at the end of world war ii , guenter verheugen studied history and worked as a journalist .
a former german minister for europe , he belongs to a generation of politicians for whom the reunification of the continent is a moral imperative .
eu duty on cigarettes has been a controversial issue the peoples of central and eastern europe , he says , were victims of hitler and stalin .
they should be welcomed into the family of european democracies .
but of course , expansion is not just about lofty ideas .
often , it is about apparently trivial matters such as the price of cigarettes .
guenter verheugen fought a hard battle to convince a fellow commissioner that candidate countries should be allowed to delay by several years introducing eu levels of duty on tobacco which would have raised the price of some popular brands of cigarettes by 50 % .
i have high hopes for enlargement john adlington , uk click here to send your comments he is very sensitive to social symbolism , a close aide told me .
he is worried that people in eastern europe are getting tired of waiting and will not accept eu membership at any price .
the next few weeks will be the hardest in mr verheugen 's political career .
he will try to nudge greek and turkish cypriot leaders towards a long-delayed settlement so that a united island can join the eu in 2004 .
challenges ahead if his efforts fail and only the greek half of cyprus enters the bloc , he will need all his diplomatic skills to avoid a huge row with turkey , which is also pressing to start formal membership talks .
he will watch anxiously as eu leaders go behind closed doors to sort out the price of expansion .
with almost half of the eu 's 100bn euro budget spent on farm subsidies , germany has given notice it will not pay a euro more to support farmers in the east , unless the whole system is reformed .
negotiations over cyprus are a tough challenge but france , which gets the lion 's share of farm aid , is stubbornly refusing any cuts .
if an agreement is reached , the overall price for expansion will remain fairly modest - as the gourmets of brussels have already calculated , expansion would cost each eu citizen the price of a good restaurant meal .
but all that could become academic if , in the upcoming referendum , the people of ireland reject for a second time the nice treaty , which prepares eu institutions for expansion .
it would be a very serious problem , mr verheugen told me , and it would certainly delay the whole process .
he compared it to shutting a door in the face of the applicant countries .
revolutionary idea mr verheugen is no stranger to controversy over referendums .
a few years ago , he raised political hackles in berlin and brussels by suggesting that people should be consulted before expansion proceeds .
the irish vote could seriously delay the process given the general public apathy in the eu over the project , the idea was nothing short of revolutionary .
hounded by journalists , mr verheugen said he simply wanted to raise awareness of this historic challenge .
then , he shrugged his shoulders and said memorably , " shit happens " .

in the hushed auditorium , the grey-haired , bespectacled man on the stage made a startling confession .
" i sometimes feel a little bit alone , " guenter verheugen told hundreds of participants at the brussels international business forum .
his plea was meant not only for the european business elite .
as enlargement enters its dramatic endgame , only 1 % of eu citizens say they are well informed about what it means .
and the commissioner in charge would like eu leaders to start spreading the message about its benefits just as tirelessly as he does .
guenter verheugen spends most of his time not in brussels , but on the road , shuttling between the 13 applicant countries and the 15 eu member states .
candidates shortlist cyprus czech republic estonia hungary latvia lithuania malta poland slovakia slovenia earlier this year , i joined him on a typically hectic two-day trip to slovakia , which took him from an impoverished gypsy settlement to bratislava university .
wearing a black cap and robe to receive an honorary degree , the commissioner looked remarkably like a judge .
indeed , an important part of his job for the last few years has been to assess how close each applicant country comes to eu standards .
but he told me he felt more like an architect or a bridge-builder .
to a great extent , the success of enlargement hangs on how skilfully he manages to bridge the gap between the interests of present member states and the hopes of the future ones .
lofty ideas born in 1944 at the end of world war ii , guenter verheugen studied history and worked as a journalist .
a former german minister for europe , he belongs to a generation of politicians for whom the reunification of the continent is a moral imperative .
the peoples of central and eastern europe , he says , were victims of hitler and stalin .
they should be welcomed into the family of european democracies .
but of course , expansion is not just about lofty ideas .
often , it is about apparently trivial matters such as the price of cigarettes .
guenter verheugen fought a hard battle to convince a fellow commissioner that candidate countries should be allowed to delay by several years introducing eu levels of duty on tobacco which would have raised the price of some popular brands of cigarettes by 50 % . "
i have high hopes for enlargement " john adlington , uk he is very sensitive to social symbolism , a close aide told me .
he is worried that people in eastern europe are getting tired of waiting and will not accept eu membership at any price .
the next few weeks will be the hardest in mr verheugen 's political career .
he will try to nudge greek and turkish cypriot leaders towards a long-delayed settlement so that a united island can join the eu in 2004 .
challenges ahead if his efforts fail and only the greek half of cyprus enters the bloc , he will need all his diplomatic skills to avoid a huge row with turkey , which is also pressing to start formal membership talks .
he will watch anxiously as eu leaders go behind closed doors to sort out the price of expansion .
with almost half of the eu 's 100bn euro budget spent on farm subsidies , germany has given notice it will not pay a euro more to support farmers in the east , unless the whole system is reformed .
but france , which gets the lion 's share of farm aid , is stubbornly refusing any cuts .
if an agreement is reached , the overall price for expansion will remain fairly modest - as the gourmets of brussels have already calculated , expansion would cost each eu citizen the price of a good restaurant meal .
but all that could become academic if , in the upcoming referendum , the people of ireland reject for a second time the nice treaty , which prepares eu institutions for expansion .
it would be a very serious problem , mr verheugen told me , and it would certainly delay the whole process .
he compared it to shutting a door in the face of the applicant countries .
revolutionary idea mr verheugen is no stranger to controversy over referendums .
a few years ago , he raised political hackles in berlin and brussels by suggesting that people should be consulted before expansion proceeds .
given the general public apathy in the eu over the project , the idea was nothing short of revolutionary .
hounded by journalists , mr verheugen said he simply wanted to raise awareness of this historic challenge .
then , he shrugged his shoulders and said memorably , " shit happens " .
those two little words could come back to haunt him at the end of the year .
but , if all goes to plan , the eu 's first - and probably last - enlargement commissioner will become technically unemployed in 2004 , when the first 10 applicant countries are set to join the eu .
this " big bang " expansion has been mr verheugen 's most daring plan .
britain and france , among others , would have liked a more gradual process .
the proof of the pudding , one british diplomat told me , is whether the eu can digest all 10 at once and still function successfully .
if not , he warned , guenter verheugen will be judged by history to have sent the european union down a blind alley .
but if it all goes well , the german commissioner will go down in history as one of the architects of europe 's first peaceful reunification .

kadie gaye bertin , a recently appointed junior minister , will now advise the president on matters of defence and mr kouassi will take up a position within the presidential office , state television reported .
all the ingredients are present for a large-scale humanitarian crisis world food programme the moves comes as government troops continue to struggle to quell rebels who have taken control of half of the country .
" the president is positioning himself to wage the war as he wants to - that is , to switch from being on the defensive to going on the offensive , it 's a new strategy , " mamadou koulibaly , the president of the national assembly , told afp .
observers say that there has been a great deal of speculation in recent days that mr kouassi would be moved because of the army 's failure to crush the three-week old rebellion .
ceasefire negotiations hopes for achieving a ceasefire now come in the form of an effort from senegal 's foreign minister cheikh tidiane gadio who has held talks with the rebels in the rebel stronghold of bouake .
the approaches were made during a lull in the fighting which flared again when ceasefire negotiations between the rebels and the government broke down last week .
mr gadio said that the rebels had been receptive and keen to talk .
however , neither side would shed any light on which elements in the talks were new .
our correspondent in bouake paul welsh says that finding common ground with the government will be difficult - they have insisted that the rebels lay down their weapons before talks can begin , effectively asking them to surrender before negotiating a peace deal .
the lull in fighting has also allowed thousands of people to flee bouake , the second biggest city in ivory coast .
humanitarian crisis the city 's middle class joined the exodus in the first light of saturday morning - leaving on foot , their possessions in bundles carried on their heads .
more than a 150,000 are thought to have left - more than a quarter of the population .

" all the ingredients are present for a large-scale humanitarian crisis through a massive displacement of people in the country and possible outflow of immigrant workers into neighbouring countries , " the wfp said .
hundreds of people have been killed during the uprising , which began on 19 september , raising fears of instability spreading across west africa .

baby erin was suffering from the life-threatening condition bronchiolitis , but she had started off just with an ordinary cough .
erin is now an ' outgoing and happy baby ' she had to have round-the-clock attention and a ventilator was helping her tiny infected lungs to breathe .
sian said : " her face was so swollen , her eyelids were shut tight , and it was upsetting for me not being able to see her bright blue eyes . "
erin was born , completely healthy , in january 2002 .
but , once back at home in anglesey , north wales , she developed bronchiolitis , caused by the rsv virus .
both her older brother and sister had been suffering from chesty coughs and colds , which were most probably caused by rsv .
laboured breathing glesni , now eight , was only mildly affected , but 18-month-old tomos developed pneumonia and needed hospital care .
but baby erin also developed symptoms , suffering from a runny nose , fever and slight shortness of breath .
when she also began vomiting the family 's doctor suggested sian and her husband ifan should take her to their local hospital in wales .
sian said : " ' initially , the medical staff were n't overly concerned because erin was n't dehydrated and not distressed .
the feeling of inadequacy at being unable to help my child was terrible sian prytherch " but at about 6pm that evening her breathing became very laboured and erin was transferred to alder hey children 's hospital , in liverpool . "
tests confirmed she had bronchiolitis .
sian added : " i did n't have a clue what it was , i 'd never heard of bronchiolitis before so it was terrifying . "
erin was in the intensive care unit for five days .
she also had to be isolated to contain the infection .
" that period of watching and just praying seemed like a lifetime , it was a living hell , " said sian .
' lifetime of waiting ' " she seemed to take one step forward , and another two back .
the first couple of days were touch and go .
" i can think of no worse experience in life that compares to having a sick child and being totally dependent on others to keep them alive .
" the feeling of inadequacy at being unable to help my child was terrible , it felt like being on the outside looking in on someone else 's life . "
luckily , erin made a full recovery from her illness but sian said : " since her illness , we have become even more concerned about her health .
' peace of mind ' " at the slightest cough or cold she is taken to the doctors to be checked out , usually for our peace of mind more than anything else .
" for the first few weeks after we came home i did n't want to take her out .
erin 's parents praised the care of nhs staff , but said more research into bronchiolitis , such as the study being funded by the charity action research , was needed to ensure other parents did not have to go through the same thing .
sian said research was essential " not only to find an effective treatment for the virus , but also to help improve early and correct diagnosis of the virus . "
