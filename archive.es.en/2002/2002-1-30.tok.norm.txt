as we gather tonight , our nation is at war , our economy is in recession , and the civilised world faces unprecedented dangers .
yet the state of our union has never been stronger .
we last met in an hour of shock and suffering .
in four short months , our nation has comforted the victims ; begun to rebuild new york and the pentagon ; rallied a great coalition ; captured , arrested , and rid the world of thousands of terrorists ; destroyed afghanistan 's terrorist training camps ; saved a people from starvation ; and freed a country from brutal oppression .
even seven thousand miles away , across oceans and continents , on mountain tops and in caves , you will not escape the justice of this nation the american flag flies again over our embassy in kabul .
terrorists who once occupied afghanistan now occupy cells at guantanamo bay .
and terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are running for their own .
america and afghanistan are now allies against terror .
we will be partners in rebuilding that country , and this evening we welcome the distinguished interim leader of a liberated afghanistan : chairman hamid karzai .
the last time we met in this chamber , the mothers and daughters of afghanistan were captives in their own homes , forbidden from working or going to school .
today women are free , and are part of afghanistan 's new government , and we welcome the new minister of women 's affairs , doctor sima samar .
our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the afghan people , to the resolve of our coalition , and to the might of the united states military .
when i called our troops into action , i did so with complete confidence in their courage and skill - and tonight , thanks to them , we are winning the war on terror .
the men and women of our armed forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of the united states : even seven thousand miles away , across oceans and continents , on mountain tops and in caves , you will not escape the justice of this nation .
' sorrow and pain ' for many americans , these four months have brought sorrow , and pain that will never completely go away .
every day a retired firefighter returns to ground zero , to feel closer to his two sons who died there .
at a memorial in new york , a little boy left his football with a note for his lost father : " dear daddy , please take this to heaven .
i do n't want to play football until i can play with you again someday . "
last month , at the grave of her husband , michael , a cia officer and marine who died in mazar-e-sharif , shannon spann said these words of farewell : " semper fi -lsb- latin abbreviation : " always faithful " -rsb- , my love . "
shannon is with us tonight .
shannon , i assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our cause is just , and our country will never forget the debt we owe michael and all who gave their lives for freedom .
' worst fears ' our cause is just , and it continues .
our discoveries in afghanistan confirmed our worst fears , and show us the true scope of the task ahead .
we have seen the depth of our enemies ' hatred in videos where they laugh about the loss of innocent life .
these enemies view the entire world as the battlefield , and we must pursue them wherever they are and the depth of their hatred is equalled by the madness of the destruction they design .
we have found diagrams of american nuclear power plants and public water facilities ; detailed instructions for making chemical weapons ; surveillance maps of american cities ; and thorough descriptions of landmarks in america and throughout the world .
what we have found in afghanistan confirms that far from ending there , our war against terror is only beginning .
most of the 19 men who hijacked planes on september 11th were trained in afghanistan 's camps - and so were tens of thousands of others .
thousands of dangerous killers , schooled in the methods of murder , often supported by outlaw regimes , are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs - set to go off without warning .
thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition partners , hundreds of terrorists have been arrested .
yet tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large .
these enemies view the entire world as the battlefield , and we must pursue them wherever they are .
so long as training camps operate , so long as nations harbour terrorists , freedom is at risk - and america and our allies must not , and will not , allow it .
our nation will continue to be steadfast , and patient , and persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives .
first , we will shut down terrorist camps , disrupt terrorist plans , and bring terrorists to justice .
and second , we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons from threatening the united states and the world .
our military has put the terror training camps of afghanistan out of business , yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries .
a terrorist underworld - including groups like hamas , hezbollah , islamic jihad , jaish-e mohammad - operates in remote jungles and deserts , and hides in the centres of large cities .
' terrorist parasites ' while the most visible military action is in afghanistan , america is acting elsewhere .
we now have troops in the philippines helping to train that country 's armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed an american , and still hold hostages .
our soldiers , working with the bosnian government , seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our embassy .
our navy is patrolling the coast of africa to block the shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in somalia .
my hope is that all nations will heed our call , and eliminate the terrorist parasites who threaten their countries , and our own .
many nations are acting forcefully .
pakistan is now cracking down on terror , and i admire the leadership of president musharraf .
but some governments will be timid in the face of terror .
and make no mistake : if they do not act , america will .
' axis of evil ' our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening america or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction .
some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since september 11th .
but we know their true nature .
north korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction , while starving its citizens .
america will do what is necessary to ensure our nation 's security iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror , while an unelected few repress the iranian people 's hope for freedom .
iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward america and to support terror .
the iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax , and nerve gas , and nuclear weapons for over a decade .
this is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens , leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children .
this is a regime that agreed to international inspections , then kicked out the inspectors .
this is a regime that has something to hide from the civilised world .
states like these , and their terrorist allies , constitute an axis of evil , arming to threaten the peace of the world .
by seeking weapons of mass destruction , these regimes pose a grave and growing danger .
they could provide these arms to terrorists , giving them the means to match their hatred .
they could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the united states .
in any of these cases , the price of indifference would be catastrophic .
we will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials , technology , and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction .
we will develop and deploy effective missile defences to protect america and our allies from sudden attack .
and all nations should know : america will do what is necessary to ensure our nation 's security .
we will be deliberate , yet time is not on our side .
i will not wait on events , while dangers gather .
i will not stand by , as peril draws closer and closer .
the united states of america will not permit the world 's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world 's most destructive weapons .
our war on terror is well begun , but it is only begun .
this campaign may not be finished on our watch , yet it must be and it will be waged on our watch .
we can not stop short .
if we stopped now , leaving terror camps intact and terror states unchecked , our sense of security would be false and temporary .
history has called america and our allies to action , and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom 's fight .
budget our first priority must always be the security of our nation , and that will be reflected in the budget i send to congress .
my budget supports three great goals for america : we will win this war , we will protect our homeland , and we will revive our economy .
my budget includes the largest increase in defence spending in two decades , because while the price of freedom and security is high , it is never too high september 11th brought out the best in america , and the best in this congress , and i join the american people in applauding your unity and resolve .
now americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward addressing problems here at home .
i am a proud member of my party - yet as we act to win the war , protect our people , and create jobs in america , we must act first and foremost not as republicans , not as democrats , but as americans .
it costs a lot to fight this war .
we have spent more than a billion dollars a month - over $ 30m a day - and we must be prepared for future operations .
afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons defeat the enemy and spare innocent lives , and we need more of them .
we need to replace ageing aircraft and make our military more agile to put our troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely .
our men and women in uniform deserve the best weapons , the best equipment , and the best training - and they also deserve another pay raise .
my budget includes the largest increase in defence spending in two decades , because while the price of freedom and security is high , it is never too high .
whatever it costs to defend our country , we will pay .
homeland security the next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect our citizens and strengthen our nation against the ongoing threat of another attack .
america will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens time and distance from the events of september 11th will not make us safer unless we act on its lessons .
america is no longer protected by vast oceans .
we are protected from attack only by vigorous action abroad , and increased vigilance at home .
my budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security , focused on four key areas : bioterrorism , emergency response , airport and border security , and improved intelligence .
we will develop vaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases .
we will increase funding to help states and communities train and equip our heroic police and firefighters .
we will improve intelligence collection and sharing , expand patrols at our borders , strengthen the security of air travel , and use technology to track the arrivals and departures of visitors to the united states .
homeland security will make america not only stronger , but in many ways better .
knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve public health ; stronger police and fire departments will mean safer neighbourhoods ; stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal drugs .
and as government works to better secure our homeland , america will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens .
a few days before christmas , an airline flight attendant spotted a passenger lighting a match .
the crew and passengers quickly subdued the man , who had been trained by al-qaeda , and was armed with explosives .
the people on that airplane were alert , and as a result , likely saved nearly 200 lives - and tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants hermis moutardier and christina jones .
' small deficit ' once we have funded our national security and our homeland security , the final great priority of my budget is economic security for the american people .
my economic security plan can be summed up in one word : jobs to achieve these great national objectives - to win the war , protect the homeland , and revitalise our economy - our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short term so long as congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally responsible way .
we have clear priorities and we must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have shown overseas : we will prevail in the war , and we will defeat this recession .
americans who have lost their jobs need our help and i support extending unemployment benefits , and direct assistance for health care coverage .
yet american workers want more than unemployment cheques - they want a steady pay cheque .
when america works , america prospers , so my economic security plan can be summed up in one word : jobs .
good jobs begin with good schools , and here we 've made a fine start .
republicans and democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so no child in america will be left behind .
i was proud to work with members of both parties - chairman john boehner and congressman george miller , senator judd gregg - and i was so proud of our work i even had nice things to say about my friend ted kennedy .
the folks at the crawford coffee shop could n't quite believe it , but our work on this bill shows what is possible if we set aside posturing and focus on results .
there is more to do .
we need to prepare our children to read and succeed in school with improved head start and early childhood development programs .
we must upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher training and launch a major recruiting drive with a great goal for america : a quality teacher in every classroom .
tax cut good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy .
this congress must act to encourage conservation , promote technology , build infrastructure , and it must act to increase energy production at home so america is less dependent on foreign oil .
good jobs depend on expanded trade .
selling into new markets creates new jobs , so i ask congress to finally approve trade promotion authority .
on these two key issues , trade and energy , the house of representatives has acted to create jobs , and i urge the senate to pass this legislation .
through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements , corporate america must be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct .
good jobs depend on sound tax policy .
last year , some in this hall thought my tax relief plan was too small , and some thought it was too big .
but when those cheques arrived in the mail , most americans thought tax relief was just about right .
congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates , doubling the child credit , and ending the death tax .
for the sake of long-term growth and to help americans plan for the future , let 's make these tax cuts permanent .
the way out of this recession , the way to create jobs , is to grow the economy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment , and by speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend .
for the sake of american workers , let 's pass a stimulus package .
good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform .
as we re-authorise these important reforms , we must always remember the goal is to reduce dependency on government and offer every american the dignity of a job .
americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without health security .
i ask congress to join me this year to enact a patients ' bill of rights , to give uninsured workers credits to help buy health coverage ; to approve an historic increase in spending for veterans ' health ; and to give seniors a sound and modern medicare system that includes coverage for prescription drugs .
a good job should lead to security in retirement .
i ask congress to enact new safeguards for 401 -lrb- k -rrb- and pension plans , because employees who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have to risk losing everything if their company fails .
through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements , corporate america must be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct .
retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of social security , and we will .
we must make social security financially stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them .
' humbled and privileged ' members , you and i will work together in the months ahead on other issues : productive farm policy ; a cleaner environment ; broader home ownership , especially among minorities ; and ways to encourage the good work of charities and faith-based groups .
i ask you to join me on these important domestic issues in the same spirit of co-operation we have applied to our war against terrorism .
during these last few months , i have been humbled and privileged to see the true character of this country in a time of testing .
our enemies believed america was weak and materialistic , that we would splinter in fear and selfishness .
they were as wrong as they are evil .
the american people have responded magnificently , with courage and compassion , strength and resolve .
as i have met the heroes , hugged the families , and looked into the tired faces of rescuers , i have stood in awe of the american people .
and i hope you will join me in expressing thanks to one american for the strength , and calm , and comfort she brings to our nation in crisis : our first lady , laura bush .
' new culture of responsibility ' none of us would ever wish the evil that was done on september 11th , yet after america was attacked , it was as if our entire country looked into a mirror , and saw our better selves .
we were reminded that we are citizens , with obligations to each other , to our country , and to history .
we began to think less of the goods we can accumulate , and more about the good we can do .
for too long our culture has said : " if it feels good , do it . "
now america is embracing a new ethic and a new creed : " let 's roll . "
in the sacrifice of soldiers , the fierce brotherhood of firefighters , and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens , we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like .
we want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self .
we have been offered a unique opportunity , and we must not let this moment pass .
we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values that will bring lasting peace my call tonight is for every american to commit at least two years - four thousand hours over the rest of your lifetime - to the service of your neighbours and your nation .
many are already serving and i thank you .
if you are n't sure how to help , i 've got a good place to start .
to sustain and extend the best that has emerged in america , i invite you to join the new usa freedom corps .
the freedom corps will focus on three areas of need : responding in case of crisis at home , rebuilding our communities , and extending american compassion throughout the world .
one purpose of the usa freedom corps will be homeland security .
america needs retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilised in major emergencies ; volunteers to help police and fire departments ; transportation and utility workers well trained in spotting danger .
our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities .
we need mentors to love children , especially children whose parents are in prison , and we need more talented teachers in troubled schools .
usa freedom corps will expand and improve the good efforts of americorps and senior corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers .
and america needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to every part of the world .
so we will renew the promise of the peace corps , double its volunteers over the next five years , and ask it to join a new effort to encourage development , and education , and opportunity in the islamic world .
this time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity , a moment we must seize to change our culture .
through the gathering momentum of millions of acts of service and decency and kindness , i know we can overcome evil with greater good .
and we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values that will bring lasting peace .
all fathers and mothers , in all societies , want their children to be educated and live free from poverty and violence .
no people on earth yearn to be oppressed , or aspire to servitude , or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police .
if anyone doubts this , let them look to afghanistan , where the islamic street greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration .
let the sceptics look to islam 's own rich history - with its centuries of learning , and tolerance , and progress .
' erasing old rivalries ' america will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere .
no nation owns these aspirations , and no nation is exempt from them .
we have no intention of imposing our culture - but america will always stand firm for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity ; the rule of law ; limits on the power of the state ; respect for women ; private property ; free speech ; equal justice ; and religious tolerance .
america will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these values around the world - including the islamic world - because we have a greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment .
we seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror .
beyond all differences of race or creed , we are one country , mourning together and facing danger together in this moment of opportunity , a common danger is erasing old rivalries .
america is working with russia , china , and india in ways we never have before to achieve peace and prosperity .
in every region , free markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power to lift lives .
together with friends and allies from europe to asia , from africa to latin america , we will demonstrate that the forces of terror can not stop the momentum of freedom .
the last time i spoke here , i expressed the hope that life would return to normal .
in some ways , it has .
in others , it never will .
those of us who have lived through these challenging times have been changed by them .
we 've come to know truths that we will never question : evil is real , and it must be opposed .
beyond all differences of race or creed , we are one country , mourning together and facing danger together .
deep in the american character , there is honour , and it is stronger than cynicism .
many have discovered again that even in tragedy - especially in tragedy - god is near .
in a single instant , we realised that this will be a decisive decade in the history of liberty - that we have been called to a unique role in human events .
rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential .
our enemies send other people 's children on missions of suicide and murder .
they embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed .
we stand for a different choice - made long ago , on the day of our founding .
we affirm it again today .
we choose freedom and the dignity of every life .
steadfast in our purpose , we now press on .
we have known freedom 's price .
we have shown freedom 's power .
and in this great conflict , my fellow americans , we will see freedom 's victory .
thank you , and god bless .

terrorists who once occupied afghanistan now occupy cells at guantanamo bay .
and terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are running for their own .
america and afghanistan are now allies against terror .
we will be partners in rebuilding that country , and this evening we welcome the distinguished interim leader of a liberated afghanistan : chairman hamid karzai .
the last time we met in this chamber , the mothers and daughters of afghanistan were captives in their own homes , forbidden from working or going to school .
today women are free , and are part of afghanistan 's new government , and we welcome the new minister of women 's affairs , doctor sima samar .
our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the afghan people , to the resolve of our coalition , and to the might of the united states military .
when i called our troops into action , i did so with complete confidence in their courage and skill - and tonight , thanks to them , we are winning the war on terror .
the men and women of our armed forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of the united states : even seven thousand miles away , across oceans and continents , on mountain tops and in caves , you will not escape the justice of this nation .
' sorrow and pain ' for many americans , these four months have brought sorrow , and pain that will never completely go away .
every day a retired firefighter returns to ground zero , to feel closer to his two sons who died there .
at a memorial in new york , a little boy left his football with a note for his lost father : " dear daddy , please take this to heaven .
i do n't want to play football until i can play with you again someday . "
last month , at the grave of her husband , michael , a cia officer and marine who died in mazar-e-sharif , shannon spann said these words of farewell : " semper fi -lsb- latin abbreviation : " always faithful " -rsb- , my love . "
shannon is with us tonight .
shannon , i assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our cause is just , and our country will never forget the debt we owe michael and all who gave their lives for freedom .
' worst fears ' our cause is just , and it continues .
our discoveries in afghanistan confirmed our worst fears , and show us the true scope of the task ahead .
we have seen the depth of our enemies ' hatred in videos where they laugh about the loss of innocent life .
these enemies view the entire world as the battlefield , and we must pursue them wherever they are and the depth of their hatred is equalled by the madness of the destruction they design .
we have found diagrams of american nuclear power plants and public water facilities ; detailed instructions for making chemical weapons ; surveillance maps of american cities ; and thorough descriptions of landmarks in america and throughout the world .
what we have found in afghanistan confirms that far from ending there , our war against terror is only beginning .
most of the 19 men who hijacked planes on september 11th were trained in afghanistan 's camps - and so were tens of thousands of others .
thousands of dangerous killers , schooled in the methods of murder , often supported by outlaw regimes , are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs - set to go off without warning .
thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition partners , hundreds of terrorists have been arrested .
yet tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large .
these enemies view the entire world as the battlefield , and we must pursue them wherever they are .
so long as training camps operate , so long as nations harbour terrorists , freedom is at risk - and america and our allies must not , and will not , allow it .
our nation will continue to be steadfast , and patient , and persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives .
first , we will shut down terrorist camps , disrupt terrorist plans , and bring terrorists to justice .
and second , we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons from threatening the united states and the world .
our military has put the terror training camps of afghanistan out of business , yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries .
a terrorist underworld - including groups like hamas , hezbollah , islamic jihad , jaish-e mohammad - operates in remote jungles and deserts , and hides in the centres of large cities .
' terrorist parasites ' while the most visible military action is in afghanistan , america is acting elsewhere .
we now have troops in the philippines helping to train that country 's armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed an american , and still hold hostages .
our soldiers , working with the bosnian government , seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our embassy .
our navy is patrolling the coast of africa to block the shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in somalia .
my hope is that all nations will heed our call , and eliminate the terrorist parasites who threaten their countries , and our own .
many nations are acting forcefully .
pakistan is now cracking down on terror , and i admire the leadership of president musharraf .
but some governments will be timid in the face of terror .
and make no mistake : if they do not act , america will .
' axis of evil ' our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening america or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction .
some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since september 11th .
but we know their true nature .
north korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction , while starving its citizens .
america will do what is necessary to ensure our nation 's security iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror , while an unelected few repress the iranian people 's hope for freedom .
iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward america and to support terror .
the iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax , and nerve gas , and nuclear weapons for over a decade .
this is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens , leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children .
this is a regime that agreed to international inspections , then kicked out the inspectors .
this is a regime that has something to hide from the civilised world .
states like these , and their terrorist allies , constitute an axis of evil , arming to threaten the peace of the world .
by seeking weapons of mass destruction , these regimes pose a grave and growing danger .
they could provide these arms to terrorists , giving them the means to match their hatred .
they could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the united states .
in any of these cases , the price of indifference would be catastrophic .
we will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials , technology , and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction .
we will develop and deploy effective missile defences to protect america and our allies from sudden attack .
and all nations should know : america will do what is necessary to ensure our nation 's security .
we will be deliberate , yet time is not on our side .
i will not wait on events , while dangers gather .
i will not stand by , as peril draws closer and closer .
the united states of america will not permit the world 's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world 's most destructive weapons .
our war on terror is well begun , but it is only begun .
this campaign may not be finished on our watch , yet it must be and it will be waged on our watch .
we can not stop short .
if we stopped now , leaving terror camps intact and terror states unchecked , our sense of security would be false and temporary .
history has called america and our allies to action , and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom 's fight .
budget our first priority must always be the security of our nation , and that will be reflected in the budget i send to congress .
my budget supports three great goals for america : we will win this war , we will protect our homeland , and we will revive our economy .
my budget includes the largest increase in defence spending in two decades , because while the price of freedom and security is high , it is never too high september 11th brought out the best in america , and the best in this congress , and i join the american people in applauding your unity and resolve .
now americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward addressing problems here at home .
i am a proud member of my party - yet as we act to win the war , protect our people , and create jobs in america , we must act first and foremost not as republicans , not as democrats , but as americans .
it costs a lot to fight this war .
we have spent more than a billion dollars a month - over $ 30m a day - and we must be prepared for future operations .
afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons defeat the enemy and spare innocent lives , and we need more of them .
we need to replace ageing aircraft and make our military more agile to put our troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely .
our men and women in uniform deserve the best weapons , the best equipment , and the best training - and they also deserve another pay raise .
my budget includes the largest increase in defence spending in two decades , because while the price of freedom and security is high , it is never too high .
whatever it costs to defend our country , we will pay .
homeland security the next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect our citizens and strengthen our nation against the ongoing threat of another attack .
america will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens time and distance from the events of september 11th will not make us safer unless we act on its lessons .
america is no longer protected by vast oceans .
we are protected from attack only by vigorous action abroad , and increased vigilance at home .
my budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security , focused on four key areas : bioterrorism , emergency response , airport and border security , and improved intelligence .
we will develop vaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases .
we will increase funding to help states and communities train and equip our heroic police and firefighters .
we will improve intelligence collection and sharing , expand patrols at our borders , strengthen the security of air travel , and use technology to track the arrivals and departures of visitors to the united states .
homeland security will make america not only stronger , but in many ways better .
knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve public health ; stronger police and fire departments will mean safer neighbourhoods ; stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal drugs .
and as government works to better secure our homeland , america will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens .
a few days before christmas , an airline flight attendant spotted a passenger lighting a match .
the crew and passengers quickly subdued the man , who had been trained by al-qaeda , and was armed with explosives .
the people on that airplane were alert , and as a result , likely saved nearly 200 lives - and tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants hermis moutardier and christina jones .
' small deficit ' once we have funded our national security and our homeland security , the final great priority of my budget is economic security for the american people .
my economic security plan can be summed up in one word : jobs to achieve these great national objectives - to win the war , protect the homeland , and revitalise our economy - our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short term so long as congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally responsible way .
we have clear priorities and we must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have shown overseas : we will prevail in the war , and we will defeat this recession .
americans who have lost their jobs need our help and i support extending unemployment benefits , and direct assistance for health care coverage .
yet american workers want more than unemployment cheques - they want a steady pay cheque .
when america works , america prospers , so my economic security plan can be summed up in one word : jobs .
good jobs begin with good schools , and here we 've made a fine start .
republicans and democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so no child in america will be left behind .
i was proud to work with members of both parties - chairman john boehner and congressman george miller , senator judd gregg - and i was so proud of our work i even had nice things to say about my friend ted kennedy .
the folks at the crawford coffee shop could n't quite believe it , but our work on this bill shows what is possible if we set aside posturing and focus on results .
there is more to do .
we need to prepare our children to read and succeed in school with improved head start and early childhood development programs .
we must upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher training and launch a major recruiting drive with a great goal for america : a quality teacher in every classroom .
tax cut good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy .
this congress must act to encourage conservation , promote technology , build infrastructure , and it must act to increase energy production at home so america is less dependent on foreign oil .
good jobs depend on expanded trade .
selling into new markets creates new jobs , so i ask congress to finally approve trade promotion authority .
on these two key issues , trade and energy , the house of representatives has acted to create jobs , and i urge the senate to pass this legislation .
through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements , corporate america must be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct .
good jobs depend on sound tax policy .
last year , some in this hall thought my tax relief plan was too small , and some thought it was too big .
but when those cheques arrived in the mail , most americans thought tax relief was just about right .
congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates , doubling the child credit , and ending the death tax .
for the sake of long-term growth and to help americans plan for the future , let 's make these tax cuts permanent .
the way out of this recession , the way to create jobs , is to grow the economy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment , and by speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend .
for the sake of american workers , let 's pass a stimulus package .
good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform .
as we re-authorise these important reforms , we must always remember the goal is to reduce dependency on government and offer every american the dignity of a job .
americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without health security .
i ask congress to join me this year to enact a patients ' bill of rights , to give uninsured workers credits to help buy health coverage ; to approve an historic increase in spending for veterans ' health ; and to give seniors a sound and modern medicare system that includes coverage for prescription drugs .
a good job should lead to security in retirement .
i ask congress to enact new safeguards for 401 -lrb- k -rrb- and pension plans , because employees who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have to risk losing everything if their company fails .
through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements , corporate america must be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct .
retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of social security , and we will .
we must make social security financially stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them .
' humbled and privileged ' members , you and i will work together in the months ahead on other issues : productive farm policy ; a cleaner environment ; broader home ownership , especially among minorities ; and ways to encourage the good work of charities and faith-based groups .
i ask you to join me on these important domestic issues in the same spirit of co-operation we have applied to our war against terrorism .
during these last few months , i have been humbled and privileged to see the true character of this country in a time of testing .
our enemies believed america was weak and materialistic , that we would splinter in fear and selfishness .
they were as wrong as they are evil .
the american people have responded magnificently , with courage and compassion , strength and resolve .
as i have met the heroes , hugged the families , and looked into the tired faces of rescuers , i have stood in awe of the american people .
and i hope you will join me in expressing thanks to one american for the strength , and calm , and comfort she brings to our nation in crisis : our first lady , laura bush .
' new culture of responsibility ' none of us would ever wish the evil that was done on september 11th , yet after america was attacked , it was as if our entire country looked into a mirror , and saw our better selves .
we were reminded that we are citizens , with obligations to each other , to our country , and to history .
we began to think less of the goods we can accumulate , and more about the good we can do .
for too long our culture has said : " if it feels good , do it . "
now america is embracing a new ethic and a new creed : " let 's roll . "
in the sacrifice of soldiers , the fierce brotherhood of firefighters , and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens , we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like .
we want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self .
we have been offered a unique opportunity , and we must not let this moment pass .
we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values that will bring lasting peace my call tonight is for every american to commit at least two years - four thousand hours over the rest of your lifetime - to the service of your neighbours and your nation .
many are already serving and i thank you .
if you are n't sure how to help , i 've got a good place to start .
to sustain and extend the best that has emerged in america , i invite you to join the new usa freedom corps .
the freedom corps will focus on three areas of need : responding in case of crisis at home , rebuilding our communities , and extending american compassion throughout the world .
one purpose of the usa freedom corps will be homeland security .
america needs retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilised in major emergencies ; volunteers to help police and fire departments ; transportation and utility workers well trained in spotting danger .
our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities .
we need mentors to love children , especially children whose parents are in prison , and we need more talented teachers in troubled schools .
usa freedom corps will expand and improve the good efforts of americorps and senior corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers .
and america needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to every part of the world .
so we will renew the promise of the peace corps , double its volunteers over the next five years , and ask it to join a new effort to encourage development , and education , and opportunity in the islamic world .
this time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity , a moment we must seize to change our culture .
through the gathering momentum of millions of acts of service and decency and kindness , i know we can overcome evil with greater good .
and we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values that will bring lasting peace .
all fathers and mothers , in all societies , want their children to be educated and live free from poverty and violence .
no people on earth yearn to be oppressed , or aspire to servitude , or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police .
if anyone doubts this , let them look to afghanistan , where the islamic street greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration .
let the sceptics look to islam 's own rich history - with its centuries of learning , and tolerance , and progress .
' erasing old rivalries ' america will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere .
no nation owns these aspirations , and no nation is exempt from them .
we have no intention of imposing our culture - but america will always stand firm for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity ; the rule of law ; limits on the power of the state ; respect for women ; private property ; free speech ; equal justice ; and religious tolerance .
america will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these values around the world - including the islamic world - because we have a greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment .
we seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror .
beyond all differences of race or creed , we are one country , mourning together and facing danger together in this moment of opportunity , a common danger is erasing old rivalries .
america is working with russia , china , and india in ways we never have before to achieve peace and prosperity .
in every region , free markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power to lift lives .
together with friends and allies from europe to asia , from africa to latin america , we will demonstrate that the forces of terror can not stop the momentum of freedom .
the last time i spoke here , i expressed the hope that life would return to normal .
in some ways , it has .
in others , it never will .
those of us who have lived through these challenging times have been changed by them .
we 've come to know truths that we will never question : evil is real , and it must be opposed .
beyond all differences of race or creed , we are one country , mourning together and facing danger together .
deep in the american character , there is honour , and it is stronger than cynicism .
many have discovered again that even in tragedy - especially in tragedy - god is near .
in a single instant , we realised that this will be a decisive decade in the history of liberty - that we have been called to a unique role in human events .
rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential .
our enemies send other people 's children on missions of suicide and murder .
they embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed .
we stand for a different choice - made long ago , on the day of our founding .
we affirm it again today .
we choose freedom and the dignity of every life .
steadfast in our purpose , we now press on .
we have known freedom 's price .
we have shown freedom 's power .
and in this great conflict , my fellow americans , we will see freedom 's victory .
thank you , and god bless .

the people that are detained in guantanamo , they are terrorists , they are not prisoners of war afghan leader hamid karzai " i see it in very clear terms , they are criminals , they brutalised afghanistan , they destroyed our land , there was no war going on , it was plain killing fields , " he said .
but mr karzai went on to say that the detainees should be well treated : " they were bad , we were good , so we should treat them nicely , " he said .
us president george w bush is currently reviewing the legal status of the captured fighters held in cuba , in what could be a step towards improving prison conditions that have been criticised internationally .
mr rumsfeld has vigorously defended the us position mr bush has ruled out giving the men pow status , arguing that they were " killers " and " terrorists " who did not belong to a recognised army .
it is possible the president may decide that they are covered by the geneva conventions , although only with the lesser protection afforded to what are called illegal combatants , says the bbc 's jon leyne .
international pressure the us has come under pressure from some countries and human rights groups who say the fighters should be treated as prisoners of war , or that at least the us should recognise that the geneva convention applies to them .
secretary of state colin powell believes the convention should apply , while others like defence secretary donald rumsfeld say the detainees should be treated as " unlawful combatants " .
the us says it is not mistreating the prisoners the arguments are important because they will determine what level of rights are given to 158 detainees captured in afghanistan and currently held at camp x-ray at the us naval base in guantanamo bay , cuba .
president bush said that at a meeting of the national security council on monday , all were agreed the detainees would be treated humanely and at least within the spirit of the geneva convention .
he said he would make a decision on their legal status later .

saudi arabia , which said that more than 100 of its nationals were being held at guantanamo , called on the us to send them back for interrogation at home .
britain , which has three citizens detained in guantanamo and another two held in afghanistan , said last week it wanted the us to return the suspects to stand trial at home .
french foreign ministry officials have also been visiting the guantanamo bay base to investigate reports that french citizens were among the detainees .

the airport was shut for three weeks following the september 11 attacks , longer than any other airport in the us due to its proximity to the capitol , the white house , numerous monuments , government buildings and military installations including the pentagon .
those three weeks out of work were enough to drive the limousine driver to homelessness and to miriam 's kitchen , said director ruth dickey .
hospitality workers suffer some estimates put unemployment as high as 50 % in washington 's hospitality industry , which includes restaurant and hotel staff as well taxi drivers .
the knock on effects of 11 september many of these workers were the last hired and now are the first fired due to the recession and the knock on effects of the september attacks .
" we 're now seeing numbers like we have n't seen since the early 1990s , " ms dickey said .
it will strain social service agencies and programmes such as miriam 's kitchen , and it will be the first test of welfare reform in the us .
the boom years the test of welfare reform will help frame the debate as much of the programme is up for reauthorisation this year in congress .
the reform effort put more emphasis on work and also placed limits of how long recipients could receive benefits .
it also moved much of the responsibility from federal control to the states .
welfare reform has been seen as a huge success .
major parts of welfare reform are up for review welfare rolls have been cut in half since reforms were introduced in 1996 , and child poverty dropped from 20.5 % in 1996 to 16.2 % in 2000 , according to census figures .
but critics of reform and some democrats say that reform coincided with the longest economic expansion in us history and does not represent a true test of the reforms .
during the late 90s , entry-level employers went to unprecedented measures to fill vacancies , often providing pay well above minimum wage and benefits including health care even for temporary work .
shadow of recession but now with the recession and some welfare recipients hitting time limits for benefits , charities are worried that the reforms may not work as well during times of want as they did in times of plenty .
" a lot of people will be cast off welfare , and the safety net is not there , " said monica testa with the capital area food bank .
welfare reform is great if you do n't need it max sawicky , economic policy institute and charities may not be able to pick up all of the slack .
from august to november of last year , the food bank saw call volume to its hunger hotline quadruple while donations were down 30 % from the year previous , ms testa said .
max sawicky with the economic policy institute said , " welfare reform is great if you do n't need it . "
and while it is on the agenda of congress for the year , it is not on the political radar , he said .
neither democrats nor republicans are expected to call for dramatic changes in welfare reform .
republicans are expected to try to add provisions that will promote marriage , and democrats are asking that welfare reform be used to help reduce poverty .
some democrats and charities say that the emphasis on putting welfare recipients back to work has often masked the fact that entry-level positions has not helped lift families out of poverty .

of course ...
' nesp ' is being used .
everybody knows it former professional cycling trainer a bbc 5live investigation has found evidence that these new drugs , some of them developed to treat cancer and kidney disease , are being abused by athletes to enhance their performances .
chief among them is a drug called aranesp .
developed by one of the world 's leading biotech firms , amgen , the drug has been hailed as a breakthrough in the treatment of anaemia brought on by cancer or kidney failure .
but according to dr bengt saltin , a leading expert on doping , the active molecule in aranesp is " 10 times more powerful " than erythropoietin , or epo , the current drug of choice for cheaters in sport .
relentless advance he says this new drug is cheaper and easier to get hold of than epo .
worst of all , he says , the chances of it being detected by current tests are " minimal " .
detection always seems several steps behind his view is shared by dr michael turner , a former medical officer for the british olympic association , who now works for the lawn tennis association and the jockey club in the uk .
he says that it is " inevitable " that aranesp will be used by the determined cheat in endurance-based sports .
he says : " the situation is that pharmaceutical companies are making new products all the time .
you then take that and put it into a perfectly fit and healthy individual and it has a number of effects it was not designed for . "
detection problem when it comes to the use of doping products , no sport has more experience than professional cycling .
it is often seen as the test bed for new drugs .
and aranesp is no exception .
aranesp active substance : darbepoetin alfa boosts red blood cell production in patients suffering from anaemia to improve their body function its effects are longer-lasting than epo ; patients require fewer injections athletes taking aranesp carry more oxygen in their blood this delays the onset of fatigue , allowing them to run harder and for longer the drug first came to light in last year 's giro d 'italia cycling race .
a police raid uncovered a number of substances , including aranesp , in the rooms of leading cyclists cyclists have told the bbc that the use of aranesp is now well established in the peloton .
in last october 's tour of spain , up to 15 riders are believed to have been on it .
former professional trainer antoine vayer says : " of course aranesp , or ' nesp ' -lrb- as the cyclists call it -rrb- , is being used .
everybody knows it .
it is a new drug ; you can buy it now but in the -lrb- doping -rrb- control you can not detect it . "
without prescription despite the fact that it is a prescription-only medicine , aranesp can be easily purchased on the internet .
five hundred dollars will buy you a month 's supply .
no questions asked .
a spokesman for amgen said it was amazed that its product was being abused in this way .
" we 've had no direct reports of this happening but we ca n't stop people misusing what is an important clinical medicine . "
however , the amgen spokesman condemned athletes who abused drugs in this way .
" the reason this company was put together was to improve human life - not to enhance performance . "
and aranesp is only the first of many new drugs that are set to give cheats the advantage for years to come .
dozens of new blood-boosting drugs are being tested by biotech companies all over the world .

its effects allow the blood to carry 20 % more oxygen than normal blood , though there are a number of serious side effects .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- emergency meeting on terrorist funds categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 30 january , 2002 , 05:24 gmt emergency meeting on terrorist funds money flows are meant to be under sharper scrutiny since 11 september terrorist funding is at the top of the agenda for the annual meeting of the world 's main body fighting financial crime this week .
the 29-nation financial action task force -lrb- fatf -rrb- has for more than a decade been gathering information and encouraging - and enforcing - best practice to try to stem money laundering .
but after 11 september attacks , its mission has expanded to focus on the funding of terrorist organisations .
in october , the body came up with eight recommendations to help law enforcement , financial institutions and other concerned parties track money destined for supporting terrorism .
they include making financing terrorism a criminal offence , getting financial institutions to report suspicious transactions , ensuring that laws are up to date , and providing cross-border assistance .
keeping score this meeting , which runs from 30 january to 1 february in hong kong , will allow member states to catch up on whether they are making headway .
all member states are meant to have gone through their laws and practices to see how they match up to the recommendations by the end of last year .
but aside from the emphasis on terrorist funding the meeting will also continue the fatf 's traditional role of researching the ways in which money from illicit sources is " washed " into the mainstream financial system .
its annual report on typologies will be updated , concentrating on correspondent banks .
the practice of banks acting as a relay for money transfers without themselves checking on transactions - essentially the role of a correspondent banking agreement - is generally seen as a key tool for money launderers .
under the microscope and the session in hong kong will also review the sanctions placed on the tiny pacific island of nauru - the first ever applied by the fatf .
nauru has incurred the fatf 's wrath by failing to upgrade its regulatory systems to cope with what observers believe is a massive flow of illicit funds , largely from russia .
the philippines is also threatened with sanctions , and is already suffering from having been put on the list of " non-cooperative countries and territories " -lrb- nccts -rrb- .
banks in fatf member states are meant to take extra care when processing transactions which have passed through nccts , slowing up the flow of commerce .
the country found itself on the list when new anti-money laundering legislation last year was judged to be inadequate .

the proposal came during a visit to afghanistan by a delegation from the imf and the world bank .
trillions of afghani banknotes could be in circulation former central bank governor khalil sediq the delegation has been holding talks with afghanistan 's interim government about ways of revitalising the country 's shattered economy .
a former governor of afghanistan 's central bank , khalil sediq , has welcomed the proposal , saying that it could help prevent disputes among various afghan factions , many of whom have circulated their own version of the country 's currency , the afghani .
budget preparations afghanistan 's interim government is currently struggling to reconstruct the country 's economic system .
one of its priorities will be to prepare a budget for the coming financial year , set to start on 21 march .
but planning is being complicated by the lack of fiscal accounting during the taleban 's rule and the fact that there are currently around seven versions of the afghani in circulation .
khalil sediq , the governor of afghanistan 's central bank before the mujaheddin took power in 1992 , said : " in afghanistan , especially over the last 10 years , trillions of afghani banknotes has been issued .
each faction has issued them for themselves to support themselves financially and the foreign supporters of these groups have also provided them with huge amounts of afghanis .
" so now i can say that maybe trillions of afghani banknotes could be in circulation . "
' valuable stopgap ' experts say that at this stage it would be extremely difficult for the interim government simply to withdraw existing afghanis and release new notes .
it could jeopardise peoples ' savings and could also be opposed by some afghan factions .
khalil sediq said that the dollar - already used for some transactions in afghanistan along with the pakistani rupee - could be a valuable stopgap .
once people realised that the dollar was being used as an interim currency , he said , they would want to acquire it and the afghani would gradually disappear from circulation .
that would make it easier for the central bank to collect the old currency and issue a new one .
as for how long that might take , the imf says it is likely to be at least two years before a new currency can be phased in .

invoking american determination to surmount its national security worries as well as its economic pains , mr bush said : " we have clear priorities and we must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have shown overseas . "
" the way out of this recession , the way to create jobs , is to grow the economy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment and by speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend , " mr bush said in calling on congress to pass an economic stimulus package .
" we will prevail in the war , and we will defeat this recession . "
warm reception it was a speech greeted with much enthusiasm by both republicans and democrats in the senate and the house of representatives .
while the us recession is largely viewed as nearing an end , what awaits mr bush is the possibility of a stagnant economy exhibiting few of the qualities of the dynamic boom economy of the 1990s .
to help forestall such a possibility , mr bush called on congress to pass an economic stimulus package that would spur confidence in the economy .
among his goals , mr bush asked congress to grant him trade promotion authority -lrb- tpa -rrb- , or what used to be called fast-track authority , to make trade deals , subject only to the up or down vote of the congress - not to revisions .
energy and education aside from his free-trade objectives , the president called on congress to pass an energy plan .
" good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy , " he said , adding that congress must encourage conservation and domestic production to reduce dependence on foreign oil .
in recalling his success in passing an education bill , mr bush called on congress to do more , insisting that a better-educated citizenry would be better able to compete in a global economy .
he left behind previous conservative objections to programmes such as head start , which seeks to get poor children into school early in order to engender good study skills .
enron collapse mr bush also called on congress to provide americans with health security by passing a patients bill of rights and by granting uninsured workers credits to buy health insurance .
he also called for improved health benefits for war veterans as well as seniors -lrb- pensioners -rrb- , with a programme that includes expanded drug allowances .
while not addressing the enron debacle directly , mr bush did call on congress to reform 401 -lrb- k -rrb- programmes and other pension plans .
he also said congress must make social security , the nation 's pension scheme , sound .
" employees who have worked all their lives should not risk everything if their company fails , " he said .
budget deficit democrats criticised the president for not speaking about the enron crisis directly , but he has kept his distance , insisting that vice president dick cheney 's private meetings to fashion energy policy with enron officials - prior to the energy concern 's collapse - were entirely appropriate .
mr bush , however , did say that corporate america must be held to the highest standards of conduct .
assuaging concern over a rising budget deficit , mr bush called on congress to rein in spending in order to keep the budget shortfall immediate and small .
the budget shortfall is largely blamed on the president 's push to cut taxes , a piece of legislation seen as mr bush 's first victory as president when he signed it into law in june .
he called on congress to do more .
" for the sake of long-term growth , and to help americans plan for the future let 's make these tax cuts permanent , " he said to cheers from republicans .
