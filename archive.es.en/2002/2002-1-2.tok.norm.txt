euro star !
germany 's frankfurter allgemiene zeitung greets the dawn of the euro with a friendly " good morning , euro " .
the paper believes that now europeans have got actual coins and banknotes in their hands , " europe , which until now most citizens have experienced as an abstract construct , will become a tangible reality day-in day-out " .
" what can be said for sure is that the euro will make more of a contribution towards building a european feeling of community than earlier steps toward integration such as the discontinuation of border checks or the launch of the single european market , " it says .
" after three years spent getting into the mood for the euro , the grief felt at parting company with national currencies has been limited even in germany , where the economy and the currency have been hallmarks of the national identity to a greater extent than in other countries " , it comments .
" for us germans , the common currency sets the seal on europe 's integration of the reunited and politically sovereign germany . "
" the feeling of european identity to which the euro contributes may even promote a culture of stability in europe " , it adds .
" many a test of its strength may lie ahead , but the euro is a sign of hope .
that being so , let us greet the new era with enthusiasm . "
hamburg 's die welt also believes there is reason to rejoice at the arrival of the euro .
" the euro will build bridges and open doors such as those symbolically depicted on its bank notes , " the paper says .
" wars among countries that share a common currency can no longer be imagined .
europe has taken a great step forward . "
for its part , the french le figaro is happy that " the ' euro bug ' did not materialize " and sees the birth of the new currency as " smooth and pain-free " .
but since 1 january was a holiday , the paper expects " the real baptism of fire " to come today , wednesday , when everyday actions like feeding coins into a parking meter , paying a motorway toll or buying a cup of coffee , threaten a day " full of euro-ambushes " .
it sees an ominous sign of teething troubles ahead in the fact that on tuesday , " the queues at the tills of the few department stores open grew longer as the day grew older " .
the euro vision thing spain 's el pais hails the introduction of the new coins as " a historic step in the building of europe " which shows that " the dream of greater integration is becoming a reality " .
however , it goes on to note that " the real euro has arrived at a difficult time for the european economy and this will be the acid test for the european monetary authorities and for economic policy " .
it urges european leaders to use " the important psychological impact " of the arrival of the euro to build a competitive , deregulated economy to rival that of the united states , noting that member countries will have to renounce sovereignty if the goal is to be achieved .
" that said , " it adds , " the european union must not limit itself to just being an internal space ...
with the euro in its pocket , the eu has an enormous international responsibility to shoulder , as a power that promotes , more by conviction than imposition , the values of liberty , tolerance , coexistence and democracy . "
germany 's frankfurter rundschau has also been looking beyond the euro to what is needed next .
the european union , its says , now has a common currency to go with its single market and the basis of a common internal and foreign policy .
" thus , in a common market with a common currency , it would be quite absurd to allow fifteen different economic , social and labour market policies to muddle along alongside and against each other , " it argues .
the paper believes the will exists to set up what it calls " some kind of economic and social government " .
what the eu lacks in the paper 's eyes , however , are the personalities with the strength , influence and common sense to put such theory into practice .
but no sign of an ' entente cordiale ' " from athens to helsinki , from lisbon to berlin , " writes the french le monde , " the europeans have welcomed the euro with child-like exuberance . "
" it was all like a big party , " the paper says , " and no-one will be churlish enough " to try and separate which part of the party celebrated the new year and which " marked the accomplishment of a monetary revolution " .
as for the french themselves , it adds , they " voted for the euro with their credit cards " .
in fact , by the time 2002 was two hours old , a total of 176,442 withdrawals for 12.8 million euros had already been made from cash dispensers the length and breadth of france .
but there were some " party-poopers " , as the paper calls them , " among them the british press , most of which is eurosceptic " .
it reports that a number of british dailies " had some fun " quoting from an article in the british journal of dermatology saying that the high nickel content of some of the new coins " could cause eczema " .
" you can take the franc out of france but you ca n't take the frenchness out of the french , " says a totally nickel-free report in britain 's the independent .
" the first day of the euro , " the paper says , " passed off in paris - and the rest of france - amid great calm and in widespread indifference to the ' rules ' laid down by french officialdom . "
the rules are that , for the brief period of coexistence between the old and new currencies , payments in francs must receive change in euros .
" bof , why should we do the government 's work ? " the paper quotes french shopkeepers as saying .
" we 'll get rid of our francs first and we 'll come around to the euro in due course . "
but this does not mean rejection of the new currency , the paper points out , " just a rejection of the rules " .
french people , it adds , " accept the theoretical necessity for red traffic lights , but that does not stop them driving through them whenever they can " .
keep it mr britain , tony in london , the times does not seem particularly concerned that britain has missed the birth of the euro .
prime minister tony blair " can wield influence as mr britain more than mr europe " , the paper believes .
his coming visit to the indian subcontinent is a case in point .
" mr blair 's voice will carry weight , " the paper says of the prime minister 's expected bid to steer india and pakistan away from war .
" although his hectic travelling has grated with many voters at home , it has boosted his standing overseas , " it adds .
this standing has nothing to do with britain being " a component part of a european union entity " , the paper points out , but rather with " the links of history , culture , language , trade and immigration " .
so those who " argue today that the arrival of the euro underlines the urgency of britain joining in if it is not to be sidelined ... miss the point " , the paper believes .
tony blair " is flying to delhi to add britain 's individual voice to the pressure for restraint " , it points out .
" if he succeeds , he will have helped more than a billion people avert war .
that would be a british achievement , not the influence of a single currency . "
towards euro-pun union ?
almost all the eu papers fail to resist the temptation to celebrate the introduction of the new currency with a series of groanworthy euro-puns .
amid tough competition , vienna 's die presse distinguishes itself by , er , coining the most words with the new euro .
" of course , " it writes , " the euro was greeted with europhoria , even though we are sad that the good old schilling is undergoing eurothanasia . "
" however , it would be a europhemism to say , " it continues , " that we have no problems with the conversions -lrb- even euroclid would probably have his difficulties -rrb- . "
perhaps the european commission should start thinking about a ban .
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

tayside health board is aiming to get people to stop smoking before they ruin their health .
according to one of the doctors behind the scheme , gp david shaw , many people still do not understand the risks they face - despite years of health warnings .
he said : " 50 % of 20-a-day smokers die early as a result of smoking , with an average of 5 to7 years of life lost .
we tend to associate an element of blame with smoking , as if it is all the smoker 's own fault - but it 's an addiction dr david shaw " about 100,000 a year die in the uk of smoking related illnesses .
if we can help even just a few of them that will be of benefit to society . "
the hotline offers advice to smokers and their friends and relatives .
there is information on products such as nicotine replacement or zyban , which suppresses addiction .
but dr shaw said the most important thing was to encourage the would-be quitters to make an appointment to visit a smoking clinic .
" research shows that people are least likely to backslide if they come into a clinic and discuss their addiction , " he added .
' do n't be embarrassed ' dr shaw said it was almost impossible to kick the habit over christmas , which tends to be a stressful time .
instead , people should try to stop when it is easiest - and he believes just after new year is a good time .
the helpline will be a 24-hour operation the doctor also stressed that addicts should not be embarrassed to admit they need help .
" we tend to associate an element of blame with smoking , as if it is all the smoker 's own fault .
" but it is an addiction , and if you can get people off cigarettes you can extend their lives , " said dr shaw .
the tayside campaign organisers believe that the important thing is to keep trying .
it has helped about 1,000 smokers already - and even those who fail are welcomed back into the fold again .
taysiders who are keen to quit can call 0845 600 9969 .
elsewhere in scotland , people can seek assistance from the scottish health education organisation , hebs , on its helpline by calling 0800 848484 .

we tend to associate an element of blame with smoking , as if it is all the smoker 's own fault - but it 's an addiction dr david shaw " about 100,000 a year die in the uk of smoking related illnesses .
if we can help even just a few of them that will be of benefit to society . "
the hotline offers advice to smokers and their friends and relatives .
there is information on products such as nicotine replacement or zyban , which suppresses addiction .
but dr shaw said the most important thing was to encourage the would-be quitters to make an appointment to visit a smoking clinic .
" research shows that people are least likely to backslide if they come into a clinic and discuss their addiction , " he added .
' do n't be embarrassed ' dr shaw said it was almost impossible to kick the habit over christmas , which tends to be a stressful time .
instead , people should try to stop when it is easiest - and he believes just after new year is a good time .
the doctor also stressed that addicts should not be embarrassed to admit they need help .
" we tend to associate an element of blame with smoking , as if it is all the smoker 's own fault .
" but it is an addiction , and if you can get people off cigarettes you can extend their lives , " said dr shaw .
the tayside campaign organisers believe that the important thing is to keep trying .
it has helped about 1,000 smokers already - and even those who fail are welcomed back into the fold again .
taysiders who are keen to quit can call 0845 600 9969 .
elsewhere in scotland , people can seek assistance from the scottish health education organisation , hebs , on its helpline by calling 0800 848484 .

" my commitment from today is to finish with an economic model that has brought desperation to the vast majority of our people , " mr duhalde told congress after a special session elected him president until new elections in 2003 .
he is the second president elected by congress since fernando de la rua resigned on 20 december amid street protests over the state of the economy .
mr duhalde , the populist peronist senator for buenos aires province , was confirmed by an overwhelming majority of 260 to 21 votes , with 18 abstentions , after a five-hour debate .
his election came after rival demonstrators clashed outside and police intervened with rubber bullets and tear gas .
mr duhalde entered the congress chamber shortly after the vote was announced to loud cheers and singing .
but he told the nation that there was nothing to celebrate , and that a lot of work had to be done to try to lift argentina out of its economic crisis .

the former vice-president , who has been accused of being over-ambitious , promised he would not stand as president when elections are held in december 2003 .
argentina has a foreign debt of $ 132bn , which it has already said it can not pay .
mr duhalde is thought to be preparing to at least partially devalue the country 's currency , the peso which is currently pegged against the dollar .
an adviser to mr duhalde has also suggested that the peso , following devaluation , would then be linked to a new basket of currencies including the brazilian real , the japanese yen and the euro .
bbc correspondent daniel schweimler says that mr duhalde is likely to last a little longer than his predecessors - having won the support of his political colleagues - but his challenge now is to win the support of the argentine people .
tension as mr duhalde was being elected in congress , supporters of his peronist party fought protesters from the opposition united left outside with sticks and stones .
argentine radio said that police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the rioters during the " hellish clash " .
stringent security measures were put in place with about 45,000 police on standby in and around the capital and soldiers on guard at the nearby government palace known as the casa rosada .
government buildings and congress itself were shaken by violent demonstrations at the weekend while the riots which prompted mr de la rua 's resignation caused 27 deaths .
demonstrators have been protesting at both the perceived economic incompetence of the government and corruption among the ruling elite .

the tug , which is based in falmouth , is looked upon as a floating insurance policy - should a crippled oil tanker or cargo ship once again threaten welsh shores .
the development comes after moves to head off a repeat of the oil disaster , which devastated more than 100 miles of welsh coastline , have been speeded up by the european parliament .
meps have voted to accelerate the phasing out of single-hull oil tankers and to replace them with safer double-hull vessels .
the single-hulled sea empress spilled more than 72,000 tonnes of crude oil into the sea when it ran aground at the entrance to milford haven estuary in pembrokeshire , west wales .
a marine accident investigation report later concluded that oil pollution would have been avoided in the initial grounding if the vessel had been constructed to the double-hull design .
critics also argued that having a powerful tug on hand to tow the vessel into open water would also have reduced the environmental destruction .
the deployment of the far sky should go some way to assauging fears that a sea empress-like disaster could be repeated .

and samsung electronics - the world 's largest chip maker - has said that it is preparing to follow suit .
the chip makers have been suffering one of the most severe slumps in the industry 's history , as personal computer demand dwindled .
this has seen chip prices plunge below cost price in some cases , leaving manufacturers with hefty losses .
the successful negotiation of price rises could signal the start of a turnaround in the industry that is highly cyclical .
share boost shares in both firms soared on wednesday , helping south korea 's kospi index to close 4.5 % higher at a 16 month high .
hynix finished 15 % higher , after hitting the shares ' daily limit , while samsung was up 10.5 % .
the chip price rise , effective on 1 january , is hynix ' third within one month .

the eu this week beefed up its anti-terrorism policies by agreeing a common definition and minimum penalties for terrorism and signed a deal to speed up police cooperation with the us .
but a row between italy and other eu states has prevented agreement on a europe-wide arrest warrant , one of several measures intended to help fight terrorism throughout europe .
the warrant is a keystone of the eu 's anti-terror measures aimed at rushing through extradition orders and overcoming the cumbersome bureaucracy which often delays cross-border cases .
the affair has become an embarrassment for the eu , which was keen to show it could move quickly to address an increased terrorist threat .
supporters of stronger measures say that in general criminals are in the ascendancy in europe and that they can cross borders where the judiciary can not detect their activities .
is crime winning across europe ?
will the new cross-border measures be effective in combating crime ?
europe today 's mark reid brought together two members of the european parliament , per gahrton of the swedish green party and the british labour mep robert evans , the vice-chair of the parliament 's home affairs committee , to discuss this issue .
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction i find it interesting that europe has broad limits on the private possession of firearms while crime is rampant .
in the us , states that allow concealed firearms carried by responsible citizens have lower than average crime rates .
the eu should institute a version of our second amendment .

things are so bad for security wagons , that all transportation of money in belgium is escorted by heavily armed police .

italy 's position on the eu-wide arrest-warrant is laughable .
it is madness to create a zone where borders are ever fading while the borders for the exchange of criminals remain .
this is something that should not have needed the terrorist attacks in the us to prompt action , it is an essential and integral part of the development of the eu .
jeroen , netherlands / usa all member states should impose judicial cooperation on italy .
the european union is not just a common market , hence the warrant and the other measures are necessary .
at the same time meps should be very attentive to how liberties and rights of european citizens would be affected by new laws against terrorism .
moreover cooperation with the us police must mean cooperation , and not an invitation to the us police to come over to europe and do whatever they want .
who knows if all these measures will be effective , but i am sure they are necessary .
francesco , italy another unnecessary bureaucratic response stephen , usa a europe-wide arrest warrant is another unnecessary bureaucratic response that will do little to reduce organized crime or terrorism .
but it will be of great help to the cause of a european super-state becoming reality .

stephen , usa with politicians like berlusconi in charge of italy , crime will win .
justice is not matter of fashion , opinions or anything else .
fiscal frauds , money laundering , bribing and corruption all put democracy and free markets in a sorry state , at best .
