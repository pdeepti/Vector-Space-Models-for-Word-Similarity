a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .
rubberneckers and disaster tourists dresden 's streets have become impossible to navigate for cars and have instead filled with pedestrians and bicycles .
some brave the up to thigh-deep waters near the baroque semper opera , leaving small wakes of muddy water trailing behind them .
so-called disaster tourists film and snap away at them and the lakes surrounding the submerged zwinger palace , where workers just a day ago hurried to move pieces from the museum 's renowned porcelain collection to floors well above the flood waters .
massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .
electricity in most of the city has been shut down .
the worst appeared to be over for dresden on saturday , after the elbe showed signs of receding , said rainer waldner , who was heading the thw workers , part of a team of more than 4,000 , on site .
pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .
now , rather than moving ahead to restore it 's former glory , it must once again piece itself back together .
though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .
but dresdeners are tough , having rebuilt from the ashes before .
utter disbelief outside the sophienkeller , a subterranean restaurant across from the zwinger , a massive generator groans as architect dietmar matthes looks on helplessly .
the 245-seat restaurant has suffered massive damage , says matthes , who has gotten little sleep since the water started coming in on wednesday .
" you lay down for three , four hours , but ca n't sleep because you 're still so nervous , " he says .
matthes ends up spending most of his time as close to the sophienkeller as possible , stacking the occasional sandbag and hoping for the best .
the floods have prompted an unprecedented wave of generosity and aid for victims and those left homeless .
the mass-circulation daily bild newspaper and television station ard hosted a gala friday night that raised some 10 million euro .
perhaps more valuable , say city residents and aid workers , are people streaming in to help stack sandbags or offer food and drinks to those laboring against the flood waters .
" it 's such a great feeling , " says george mueller , 20 , who was evacuated from his home on tuesday .
" all the people are trying to help each other .
it 's amazing actually . "
just a few feet away , dozens of people are stacking sandbags at the entrances to the lower floors of the st. benno gynmnasium which , although relatively removed from the elbe river , is slowly filling with water .
they work methodically and quickly , stacking sandbags that came in on massive trucks carrying even more helpers .
sven schrick drove down from berlin with his wife thursday night to pitch in .
the heating technician says the couple is planning to go around the city until monday , volunteering where help is needed .
" nobody could anticipate this , " schrick says , before heading off to stack more sandbags .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .
rubberneckers and disaster tourists dresden 's streets have become impossible to navigate for cars and have instead filled with pedestrians and bicycles .
some brave the up to thigh-deep waters near the baroque semper opera , leaving small wakes of muddy water trailing behind them .
so-called disaster tourists film and snap away at them and the lakes surrounding the submerged zwinger palace , where workers just a day ago hurried to move pieces from the museum 's renowned porcelain collection to floors well above the flood waters .
massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .
electricity in most of the city has been shut down .
the worst appeared to be over for dresden on saturday , after the elbe showed signs of receding , said rainer waldner , who was heading the thw workers , part of a team of more than 4,000 , on site .
pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .
now , rather than moving ahead to restore it 's former glory , it must once again piece itself back together .
though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .
but dresdeners are tough , having rebuilt from the ashes before .
utter disbelief outside the sophienkeller , a subterranean restaurant across from the zwinger , a massive generator groans as architect dietmar matthes looks on helplessly .
the 245-seat restaurant has suffered massive damage , says matthes , who has gotten little sleep since the water started coming in on wednesday .
" you lay down for three , four hours , but ca n't sleep because you 're still so nervous , " he says .
matthes ends up spending most of his time as close to the sophienkeller as possible , stacking the occasional sandbag and hoping for the best .
the floods have prompted an unprecedented wave of generosity and aid for victims and those left homeless .
the mass-circulation daily bild newspaper and television station ard hosted a gala friday night that raised some 10 million euro .
perhaps more valuable , say city residents and aid workers , are people streaming in to help stack sandbags or offer food and drinks to those laboring against the flood waters .
" it 's such a great feeling , " says george mueller , 20 , who was evacuated from his home on tuesday .
" all the people are trying to help each other .
it 's amazing actually . "
just a few feet away , dozens of people are stacking sandbags at the entrances to the lower floors of the st. benno gynmnasium which , although relatively removed from the elbe river , is slowly filling with water .
they work methodically and quickly , stacking sandbags that came in on massive trucks carrying even more helpers .
sven schrick drove down from berlin with his wife thursday night to pitch in .
the heating technician says the couple is planning to go around the city until monday , volunteering where help is needed .
" nobody could anticipate this , " schrick says , before heading off to stack more sandbags .
" but by national catastrophes of this magnitude , as mr. schoeder said , we all need to come together . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the social worker had to make sure the 64 handicapped and elderly residents he cared for were brought out safely . the knocks on the door early wednesday morning came hard and loud . frank jesuiter was expecting them .
on tuesday night , he had watched with disbelief as a flood he was sure would not touch his apartment building in dresden ’ s historic district rose more than 3 meters -lrb- about 10 feet -rrb- .
by wednesday morning , city officials had decided it was time to move everyone out of the 12-story building . “ we had five minutes to get together all of our things and leave , ” jesuiter said . for the social worker , the panic was especially acute .
in addition to his own things , jesuiter and five of his colleagues were responsible for the medication and care of 64 psychologically impaired and elderly patients . he hurriedly gathered medication together , as police spread the word .
the patients began to panic .

“ you couldn ’ t forget things like your money or your wallet . ” where to next ? outside , a motor boat and six large police row boats had pulled up to evacuate the building 's 216 residents .

by wednesday morning , city officials had decided it was time to move everyone out of the 12-story building . “ we had five minutes to get together all of our things and leave , ” jesuiter said . for the social worker , the panic was especially acute .
in addition to his own things , jesuiter and five of his colleagues were responsible for the medication and care of 64 psychologically impaired and elderly patients . he hurriedly gathered medication together , as police spread the word .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .
rubberneckers and disaster tourists dresden 's streets have become impossible to navigate for cars and have instead filled with pedestrians and bicycles .
some brave the up to thigh-deep waters near the baroque semper opera , leaving small wakes of muddy water trailing behind them .
so-called disaster tourists film and snap away at them and the lakes surrounding the submerged zwinger palace , where workers just a day ago hurried to move pieces from the museum 's renowned porcelain collection to floors well above the flood waters .
massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .
electricity in most of the city has been shut down .
the worst appeared to be over for dresden on saturday , after the elbe showed signs of receding , said rainer waldner , who was heading the thw workers , part of a team of more than 4,000 , on site .
pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .
now , rather than moving ahead to restore it 's former glory , it must once again piece itself back together .
though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .
but dresdeners are tough , having rebuilt from the ashes before .
utter disbelief outside the sophienkeller , a subterranean restaurant across from the zwinger , a massive generator groans as architect dietmar matthes looks on helplessly .
the 245-seat restaurant has suffered massive damage , says matthes , who has gotten little sleep since the water started coming in on wednesday .
" you lay down for three , four hours , but ca n't sleep because you 're still so nervous , " he says .
matthes ends up spending most of his time as close to the sophienkeller as possible , stacking the occasional sandbag and hoping for the best .
the floods have prompted an unprecedented wave of generosity and aid for victims and those left homeless .
the mass-circulation daily bild newspaper and television station ard hosted a gala friday night that raised some 10 million euro .
perhaps more valuable , say city residents and aid workers , are people streaming in to help stack sandbags or offer food and drinks to those laboring against the flood waters .
" it 's such a great feeling , " says george mueller , 20 , who was evacuated from his home on tuesday .
" all the people are trying to help each other .
it 's amazing actually . "
just a few feet away , dozens of people are stacking sandbags at the entrances to the lower floors of the st. benno gynmnasium which , although relatively removed from the elbe river , is slowly filling with water .
they work methodically and quickly , stacking sandbags that came in on massive trucks carrying even more helpers .
sven schrick drove down from berlin with his wife thursday night to pitch in .
the heating technician says the couple is planning to go around the city until monday , volunteering where help is needed .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .
rubberneckers and disaster tourists dresden 's streets have become impossible to navigate for cars and have instead filled with pedestrians and bicycles .
some brave the up to thigh-deep waters near the baroque semper opera , leaving small wakes of muddy water trailing behind them .
so-called disaster tourists film and snap away at them and the lakes surrounding the submerged zwinger palace , where workers just a day ago hurried to move pieces from the museum 's renowned porcelain collection to floors well above the flood waters .
massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .
electricity in most of the city has been shut down .
the worst appeared to be over for dresden on saturday , after the elbe showed signs of receding , said rainer waldner , who was heading the thw workers , part of a team of more than 4,000 , on site .
pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .
now , rather than moving ahead to restore it 's former glory , it must once again piece itself back together .
though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .
but dresdeners are tough , having rebuilt from the ashes before .
utter disbelief outside the sophienkeller , a subterranean restaurant across from the zwinger , a massive generator groans as architect dietmar matthes looks on helplessly .
the 245-seat restaurant has suffered massive damage , says matthes , who has gotten little sleep since the water started coming in on wednesday .
" you lay down for three , four hours , but ca n't sleep because you 're still so nervous , " he says .
matthes ends up spending most of his time as close to the sophienkeller as possible , stacking the occasional sandbag and hoping for the best .
the floods have prompted an unprecedented wave of generosity and aid for victims and those left homeless .
the mass-circulation daily bild newspaper and television station ard hosted a gala friday night that raised some 10 million euro .
perhaps more valuable , say city residents and aid workers , are people streaming in to help stack sandbags or offer food and drinks to those laboring against the flood waters .
" it 's such a great feeling , " says george mueller , 20 , who was evacuated from his home on tuesday .
" all the people are trying to help each other .
it 's amazing actually . "
just a few feet away , dozens of people are stacking sandbags at the entrances to the lower floors of the st. benno gynmnasium which , although relatively removed from the elbe river , is slowly filling with water .
they work methodically and quickly , stacking sandbags that came in on massive trucks carrying even more helpers .
sven schrick drove down from berlin with his wife thursday night to pitch in .
the heating technician says the couple is planning to go around the city until monday , volunteering where help is needed .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .
rubberneckers and disaster tourists dresden 's streets have become impossible to navigate for cars and have instead filled with pedestrians and bicycles .
some brave the up to thigh-deep waters near the baroque semper opera , leaving small wakes of muddy water trailing behind them .
so-called disaster tourists film and snap away at them and the lakes surrounding the submerged zwinger palace , where workers just a day ago hurried to move pieces from the museum 's renowned porcelain collection to floors well above the flood waters .
massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .
electricity in most of the city has been shut down .
the worst appeared to be over for dresden on saturday , after the elbe showed signs of receding , said rainer waldner , who was heading the thw workers , part of a team of more than 4,000 , on site .
pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .
now , rather than moving ahead to restore it 's former glory , it must once again piece itself back together .
though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .
but dresdeners are tough , having rebuilt from the ashes before .
utter disbelief outside the sophienkeller , a subterranean restaurant across from the zwinger , a massive generator groans as architect dietmar matthes looks on helplessly .
the 245-seat restaurant has suffered massive damage , says matthes , who has gotten little sleep since the water started coming in on wednesday .
" you lay down for three , four hours , but ca n't sleep because you 're still so nervous , " he says .
matthes ends up spending most of his time as close to the sophienkeller as possible , stacking the occasional sandbag and hoping for the best .
the floods have prompted an unprecedented wave of generosity and aid for victims and those left homeless .
the mass-circulation daily bild newspaper and television station ard hosted a gala friday night that raised some 10 million euro .
perhaps more valuable , say city residents and aid workers , are people streaming in to help stack sandbags or offer food and drinks to those laboring against the flood waters .
" it 's such a great feeling , " says george mueller , 20 , who was evacuated from his home on tuesday .
" all the people are trying to help each other .
it 's amazing actually . "
just a few feet away , dozens of people are stacking sandbags at the entrances to the lower floors of the st. benno gynmnasium which , although relatively removed from the elbe river , is slowly filling with water .
they work methodically and quickly , stacking sandbags that came in on massive trucks carrying even more helpers .
sven schrick drove down from berlin with his wife thursday night to pitch in .
the heating technician says the couple is planning to go around the city until monday , volunteering where help is needed .
" nobody could anticipate this , " schrick says , before heading off to stack more sandbags .
" but by national catastrophes of this magnitude , as mr. schoeder said , we all need to come together . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the social worker had to make sure the 64 handicapped and elderly residents he cared for were brought out safely . the knocks on the door early wednesday morning came hard and loud . frank jesuiter was expecting them .
on tuesday night , he had watched with disbelief as a flood he was sure would not touch his apartment building in dresden ’ s historic district rose more than 3 meters -lrb- about 10 feet -rrb- .
by wednesday morning , city officials had decided it was time to move everyone out of the 12-story building . “ we had five minutes to get together all of our things and leave , ” jesuiter said . for the social worker , the panic was especially acute .
in addition to his own things , jesuiter and five of his colleagues were responsible for the medication and care of 64 psychologically impaired and elderly patients . he hurriedly gathered medication together , as police spread the word .
the patients began to panic .
as he packed , he wondered why they hadn ’ t had more time to get everything together . the elbe had been rising all night , after all , he thought to himself . “ they could have given us at least 15 or 20 minutes to take care of it all , ” he said .
“ you couldn ’ t forget things like your money or your wallet . ” where to next ? outside , a motor boat and six large police row boats had pulled up to evacuate the building 's 216 residents .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .
rubberneckers and disaster tourists dresden 's streets have become impossible to navigate for cars and have instead filled with pedestrians and bicycles .
some brave the up to thigh-deep waters near the baroque semper opera , leaving small wakes of muddy water trailing behind them .
so-called disaster tourists film and snap away at them and the lakes surrounding the submerged zwinger palace , where workers just a day ago hurried to move pieces from the museum 's renowned porcelain collection to floors well above the flood waters .
massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .
electricity in most of the city has been shut down .
the worst appeared to be over for dresden on saturday , after the elbe showed signs of receding , said rainer waldner , who was heading the thw workers , part of a team of more than 4,000 , on site .
pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .
now , rather than moving ahead to restore it 's former glory , it must once again piece itself back together .
though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .
but dresdeners are tough , having rebuilt from the ashes before .
utter disbelief outside the sophienkeller , a subterranean restaurant across from the zwinger , a massive generator groans as architect dietmar matthes looks on helplessly .
the 245-seat restaurant has suffered massive damage , says matthes , who has gotten little sleep since the water started coming in on wednesday .
" you lay down for three , four hours , but ca n't sleep because you 're still so nervous , " he says .
matthes ends up spending most of his time as close to the sophienkeller as possible , stacking the occasional sandbag and hoping for the best .
the floods have prompted an unprecedented wave of generosity and aid for victims and those left homeless .
the mass-circulation daily bild newspaper and television station ard hosted a gala friday night that raised some 10 million euro .
perhaps more valuable , say city residents and aid workers , are people streaming in to help stack sandbags or offer food and drinks to those laboring against the flood waters .
" it 's such a great feeling , " says george mueller , 20 , who was evacuated from his home on tuesday .
" all the people are trying to help each other .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .
rubberneckers and disaster tourists dresden 's streets have become impossible to navigate for cars and have instead filled with pedestrians and bicycles .
some brave the up to thigh-deep waters near the baroque semper opera , leaving small wakes of muddy water trailing behind them .
so-called disaster tourists film and snap away at them and the lakes surrounding the submerged zwinger palace , where workers just a day ago hurried to move pieces from the museum 's renowned porcelain collection to floors well above the flood waters .
massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .
electricity in most of the city has been shut down .
the worst appeared to be over for dresden on saturday , after the elbe showed signs of receding , said rainer waldner , who was heading the thw workers , part of a team of more than 4,000 , on site .
pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .
now , rather than moving ahead to restore it 's former glory , it must once again piece itself back together .
though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .
but dresdeners are tough , having rebuilt from the ashes before .
utter disbelief outside the sophienkeller , a subterranean restaurant across from the zwinger , a massive generator groans as architect dietmar matthes looks on helplessly .
the 245-seat restaurant has suffered massive damage , says matthes , who has gotten little sleep since the water started coming in on wednesday .
" you lay down for three , four hours , but ca n't sleep because you 're still so nervous , " he says .
matthes ends up spending most of his time as close to the sophienkeller as possible , stacking the occasional sandbag and hoping for the best .
the floods have prompted an unprecedented wave of generosity and aid for victims and those left homeless .
the mass-circulation daily bild newspaper and television station ard hosted a gala friday night that raised some 10 million euro .
perhaps more valuable , say city residents and aid workers , are people streaming in to help stack sandbags or offer food and drinks to those laboring against the flood waters .
" it 's such a great feeling , " says george mueller , 20 , who was evacuated from his home on tuesday .
" all the people are trying to help each other .
it 's amazing actually . "
just a few feet away , dozens of people are stacking sandbags at the entrances to the lower floors of the st. benno gynmnasium which , although relatively removed from the elbe river , is slowly filling with water .
they work methodically and quickly , stacking sandbags that came in on massive trucks carrying even more helpers .
sven schrick drove down from berlin with his wife thursday night to pitch in .
the heating technician says the couple is planning to go around the city until monday , volunteering where help is needed .
" nobody could anticipate this , " schrick says , before heading off to stack more sandbags .
" but by national catastrophes of this magnitude , as mr. schoeder said , we all need to come together . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the social worker had to make sure the 64 handicapped and elderly residents he cared for were brought out safely . the knocks on the door early wednesday morning came hard and loud . frank jesuiter was expecting them .
on tuesday night , he had watched with disbelief as a flood he was sure would not touch his apartment building in dresden ’ s historic district rose more than 3 meters -lrb- about 10 feet -rrb- .
by wednesday morning , city officials had decided it was time to move everyone out of the 12-story building . “ we had five minutes to get together all of our things and leave , ” jesuiter said . for the social worker , the panic was especially acute .
in addition to his own things , jesuiter and five of his colleagues were responsible for the medication and care of 64 psychologically impaired and elderly patients . he hurriedly gathered medication together , as police spread the word .
the patients began to panic .
as he packed , he wondered why they hadn ’ t had more time to get everything together . the elbe had been rising all night , after all , he thought to himself . “ they could have given us at least 15 or 20 minutes to take care of it all , ” he said .
“ you couldn ’ t forget things like your money or your wallet . ” where to next ? outside , a motor boat and six large police row boats had pulled up to evacuate the building 's 216 residents .
jesuiter watched with concern as eight of his elderly patients were handed through the windows onto the boats . they paddled and motored their way through an abandoned city .
as they passed the abandoned buildings of the old quarter , jesuiter wondered where they were headed to next . sport centers and schools across dresden have been turned into temporary shelters for evacuees in the past week .
overnight , tent cities have sprung up where families while away the hours until they can return home and assess the damage . “ we thought we were going to some tent camp , ” he said .
“ with sick people , with alcoholics , that would have been extremely strenuous . ” once on dry land , jesuiter met with the other caretakers and rescue officials .
they were able to secure housing in a sprawling , comfortable training center on the outskirts of the city center . fleeing the angry elbe the stay has been as relaxed as possible , says jesuiter .
but like thousands across dresden , he has begun wondering what will still be there when he returns home .
the walls will be moist beyond repair , he estimates .
his furniture , his bible collection , his lovely bulgarian rug are most likely all gone . “ i ’ ll just throw them away , ” he said . dresden has lost its charm for jesuiter , a resident since he moved from rostock in 1987 .
he plans to move some place further north , someplace higher .
the elbe , he says , is trying to find its old path , carved before people came and erected houses and office parks and cathedrals . “ the elbe has so much power now , ” he said , speaking as if the river was a living , breathing life form .
“ it wants to find its way back to these places . ” he said he is concerned his patients will think so as well .
the flood , the evacuations have all been traumatic for them .
he hopes to find them temporary shelter in hospitals and only return them to the apartment building when officials can assure there ’ s no more moistness or water damage . “ they can ’ t feel that they ’ re in a prison , ” he said . “ that the elbe will one day climb again and trap them . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the social worker had to make sure the 64 handicapped and elderly residents he cared for were brought out safely . the knocks on the door early wednesday morning came hard and loud . frank jesuiter was expecting them .
on tuesday night , he had watched with disbelief as a flood he was sure would not touch his apartment building in dresden ’ s historic district rose more than 3 meters -lrb- about 10 feet -rrb- .
by wednesday morning , city officials had decided it was time to move everyone out of the 12-story building . “ we had five minutes to get together all of our things and leave , ” jesuiter said . for the social worker , the panic was especially acute .
in addition to his own things , jesuiter and five of his colleagues were responsible for the medication and care of 64 psychologically impaired and elderly patients . he hurriedly gathered medication together , as police spread the word .
the patients began to panic .
as he packed , he wondered why they hadn ’ t had more time to get everything together . the elbe had been rising all night , after all , he thought to himself . “ they could have given us at least 15 or 20 minutes to take care of it all , ” he said .
“ you couldn ’ t forget things like your money or your wallet . ” where to next ? outside , a motor boat and six large police row boats had pulled up to evacuate the building 's 216 residents .
jesuiter watched with concern as eight of his elderly patients were handed through the windows onto the boats . they paddled and motored their way through an abandoned city .
as they passed the abandoned buildings of the old quarter , jesuiter wondered where they were headed to next . sport centers and schools across dresden have been turned into temporary shelters for evacuees in the past week .
overnight , tent cities have sprung up where families while away the hours until they can return home and assess the damage . “ we thought we were going to some tent camp , ” he said .

they were able to secure housing in a sprawling , comfortable training center on the outskirts of the city center . fleeing the angry elbe the stay has been as relaxed as possible , says jesuiter .
but like thousands across dresden , he has begun wondering what will still be there when he returns home .
the walls will be moist beyond repair , he estimates .
his furniture , his bible collection , his lovely bulgarian rug are most likely all gone . “ i ’ ll just throw them away , ” he said . dresden has lost its charm for jesuiter , a resident since he moved from rostock in 1987 .
he plans to move some place further north , someplace higher .
the elbe , he says , is trying to find its old path , carved before people came and erected houses and office parks and cathedrals . “ the elbe has so much power now , ” he said , speaking as if the river was a living , breathing life form .
“ it wants to find its way back to these places . ” he said he is concerned his patients will think so as well .
the flood , the evacuations have all been traumatic for them .
he hopes to find them temporary shelter in hospitals and only return them to the apartment building when officials can assure there ’ s no more moistness or water damage . “ they can ’ t feel that they ’ re in a prison , ” he said . “ that the elbe will one day climb again and trap them . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .
rubberneckers and disaster tourists dresden 's streets have become impossible to navigate for cars and have instead filled with pedestrians and bicycles .
some brave the up to thigh-deep waters near the baroque semper opera , leaving small wakes of muddy water trailing behind them .
so-called disaster tourists film and snap away at them and the lakes surrounding the submerged zwinger palace , where workers just a day ago hurried to move pieces from the museum 's renowned porcelain collection to floors well above the flood waters .
massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .
electricity in most of the city has been shut down .
the worst appeared to be over for dresden on saturday , after the elbe showed signs of receding , said rainer waldner , who was heading the thw workers , part of a team of more than 4,000 , on site .
pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .

though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .
but dresdeners are tough , having rebuilt from the ashes before .
utter disbelief outside the sophienkeller , a subterranean restaurant across from the zwinger , a massive generator groans as architect dietmar matthes looks on helplessly .
the 245-seat restaurant has suffered massive damage , says matthes , who has gotten little sleep since the water started coming in on wednesday .
" you lay down for three , four hours , but ca n't sleep because you 're still so nervous , " he says .
matthes ends up spending most of his time as close to the sophienkeller as possible , stacking the occasional sandbag and hoping for the best .
the floods have prompted an unprecedented wave of generosity and aid for victims and those left homeless .
the mass-circulation daily bild newspaper and television station ard hosted a gala friday night that raised some 10 million euro .
perhaps more valuable , say city residents and aid workers , are people streaming in to help stack sandbags or offer food and drinks to those laboring against the flood waters .
" it 's such a great feeling , " says george mueller , 20 , who was evacuated from his home on tuesday .
" all the people are trying to help each other .
it 's amazing actually . "
just a few feet away , dozens of people are stacking sandbags at the entrances to the lower floors of the st. benno gynmnasium which , although relatively removed from the elbe river , is slowly filling with water .
they work methodically and quickly , stacking sandbags that came in on massive trucks carrying even more helpers .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "

the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .

pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .

pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .
now , rather than moving ahead to restore it 's former glory , it must once again piece itself back together .
though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .
but dresdeners are tough , having rebuilt from the ashes before .
utter disbelief outside the sophienkeller , a subterranean restaurant across from the zwinger , a massive generator groans as architect dietmar matthes looks on helplessly .
the 245-seat restaurant has suffered massive damage , says matthes , who has gotten little sleep since the water started coming in on wednesday .
" you lay down for three , four hours , but ca n't sleep because you 're still so nervous , " he says .
matthes ends up spending most of his time as close to the sophienkeller as possible , stacking the occasional sandbag and hoping for the best .
the floods have prompted an unprecedented wave of generosity and aid for victims and those left homeless .
the mass-circulation daily bild newspaper and television station ard hosted a gala friday night that raised some 10 million euro .
perhaps more valuable , say city residents and aid workers , are people streaming in to help stack sandbags or offer food and drinks to those laboring against the flood waters .
" it 's such a great feeling , " says george mueller , 20 , who was evacuated from his home on tuesday .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .
rubberneckers and disaster tourists dresden 's streets have become impossible to navigate for cars and have instead filled with pedestrians and bicycles .
some brave the up to thigh-deep waters near the baroque semper opera , leaving small wakes of muddy water trailing behind them .
so-called disaster tourists film and snap away at them and the lakes surrounding the submerged zwinger palace , where workers just a day ago hurried to move pieces from the museum 's renowned porcelain collection to floors well above the flood waters .
massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .
electricity in most of the city has been shut down .
the worst appeared to be over for dresden on saturday , after the elbe showed signs of receding , said rainer waldner , who was heading the thw workers , part of a team of more than 4,000 , on site .

the social worker had to make sure the 64 handicapped and elderly residents he cared for were brought out safely . the knocks on the door early wednesday morning came hard and loud . frank jesuiter was expecting them .
on tuesday night , he had watched with disbelief as a flood he was sure would not touch his apartment building in dresden ’ s historic district rose more than 3 meters -lrb- about 10 feet -rrb- .
by wednesday morning , city officials had decided it was time to move everyone out of the 12-story building . “ we had five minutes to get together all of our things and leave , ” jesuiter said . for the social worker , the panic was especially acute .
in addition to his own things , jesuiter and five of his colleagues were responsible for the medication and care of 64 psychologically impaired and elderly patients . he hurriedly gathered medication together , as police spread the word .
the patients began to panic .
as he packed , he wondered why they hadn ’ t had more time to get everything together . the elbe had been rising all night , after all , he thought to himself . “ they could have given us at least 15 or 20 minutes to take care of it all , ” he said .
“ you couldn ’ t forget things like your money or your wallet . ” where to next ? outside , a motor boat and six large police row boats had pulled up to evacuate the building 's 216 residents .
jesuiter watched with concern as eight of his elderly patients were handed through the windows onto the boats . they paddled and motored their way through an abandoned city .
as they passed the abandoned buildings of the old quarter , jesuiter wondered where they were headed to next . sport centers and schools across dresden have been turned into temporary shelters for evacuees in the past week .
overnight , tent cities have sprung up where families while away the hours until they can return home and assess the damage . “ we thought we were going to some tent camp , ” he said .
“ with sick people , with alcoholics , that would have been extremely strenuous . ” once on dry land , jesuiter met with the other caretakers and rescue officials .
they were able to secure housing in a sprawling , comfortable training center on the outskirts of the city center . fleeing the angry elbe the stay has been as relaxed as possible , says jesuiter .
but like thousands across dresden , he has begun wondering what will still be there when he returns home .
the walls will be moist beyond repair , he estimates .
his furniture , his bible collection , his lovely bulgarian rug are most likely all gone . “ i ’ ll just throw them away , ” he said . dresden has lost its charm for jesuiter , a resident since he moved from rostock in 1987 .
he plans to move some place further north , someplace higher .
the elbe , he says , is trying to find its old path , carved before people came and erected houses and office parks and cathedrals . “ the elbe has so much power now , ” he said , speaking as if the river was a living , breathing life form .
“ it wants to find its way back to these places . ” he said he is concerned his patients will think so as well .
the flood , the evacuations have all been traumatic for them .
he hopes to find them temporary shelter in hospitals and only return them to the apartment building when officials can assure there ’ s no more moistness or water damage . “ they can ’ t feel that they ’ re in a prison , ” he said . “ that the elbe will one day climb again and trap them . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in addition to his own things , jesuiter and five of his colleagues were responsible for the medication and care of 64 psychologically impaired and elderly patients . he hurriedly gathered medication together , as police spread the word .

the walls will be moist beyond repair , he estimates .
his furniture , his bible collection , his lovely bulgarian rug are most likely all gone . “ i ’ ll just throw them away , ” he said . dresden has lost its charm for jesuiter , a resident since he moved from rostock in 1987 .

“ it wants to find its way back to these places . ” he said he is concerned his patients will think so as well .
the flood , the evacuations have all been traumatic for them .
he hopes to find them temporary shelter in hospitals and only return them to the apartment building when officials can assure there ’ s no more moistness or water damage . “ they can ’ t feel that they ’ re in a prison , ” he said . “ that the elbe will one day climb again and trap them . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in addition to his own things , jesuiter and five of his colleagues were responsible for the medication and care of 64 psychologically impaired and elderly patients . he hurriedly gathered medication together , as police spread the word .
the patients began to panic .
as he packed , he wondered why they hadn ’ t had more time to get everything together . the elbe had been rising all night , after all , he thought to himself . “ they could have given us at least 15 or 20 minutes to take care of it all , ” he said .
“ you couldn ’ t forget things like your money or your wallet . ” where to next ? outside , a motor boat and six large police row boats had pulled up to evacuate the building 's 216 residents .
jesuiter watched with concern as eight of his elderly patients were handed through the windows onto the boats . they paddled and motored their way through an abandoned city .
as they passed the abandoned buildings of the old quarter , jesuiter wondered where they were headed to next . sport centers and schools across dresden have been turned into temporary shelters for evacuees in the past week .
overnight , tent cities have sprung up where families while away the hours until they can return home and assess the damage . “ we thought we were going to some tent camp , ” he said .
“ with sick people , with alcoholics , that would have been extremely strenuous . ” once on dry land , jesuiter met with the other caretakers and rescue officials .
they were able to secure housing in a sprawling , comfortable training center on the outskirts of the city center . fleeing the angry elbe the stay has been as relaxed as possible , says jesuiter .
but like thousands across dresden , he has begun wondering what will still be there when he returns home .
the walls will be moist beyond repair , he estimates .
his furniture , his bible collection , his lovely bulgarian rug are most likely all gone . “ i ’ ll just throw them away , ” he said . dresden has lost its charm for jesuiter , a resident since he moved from rostock in 1987 .
he plans to move some place further north , someplace higher .
the elbe , he says , is trying to find its old path , carved before people came and erected houses and office parks and cathedrals . “ the elbe has so much power now , ” he said , speaking as if the river was a living , breathing life form .
“ it wants to find its way back to these places . ” he said he is concerned his patients will think so as well .
the flood , the evacuations have all been traumatic for them .
he hopes to find them temporary shelter in hospitals and only return them to the apartment building when officials can assure there ’ s no more moistness or water damage . “ they can ’ t feel that they ’ re in a prison , ” he said . “ that the elbe will one day climb again and trap them . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .
rubberneckers and disaster tourists dresden 's streets have become impossible to navigate for cars and have instead filled with pedestrians and bicycles .
some brave the up to thigh-deep waters near the baroque semper opera , leaving small wakes of muddy water trailing behind them .
so-called disaster tourists film and snap away at them and the lakes surrounding the submerged zwinger palace , where workers just a day ago hurried to move pieces from the museum 's renowned porcelain collection to floors well above the flood waters .
massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .
electricity in most of the city has been shut down .
the worst appeared to be over for dresden on saturday , after the elbe showed signs of receding , said rainer waldner , who was heading the thw workers , part of a team of more than 4,000 , on site .
pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .
now , rather than moving ahead to restore it 's former glory , it must once again piece itself back together .
though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .
but dresdeners are tough , having rebuilt from the ashes before .
utter disbelief outside the sophienkeller , a subterranean restaurant across from the zwinger , a massive generator groans as architect dietmar matthes looks on helplessly .
the 245-seat restaurant has suffered massive damage , says matthes , who has gotten little sleep since the water started coming in on wednesday .
" you lay down for three , four hours , but ca n't sleep because you 're still so nervous , " he says .
matthes ends up spending most of his time as close to the sophienkeller as possible , stacking the occasional sandbag and hoping for the best .
the floods have prompted an unprecedented wave of generosity and aid for victims and those left homeless .
the mass-circulation daily bild newspaper and television station ard hosted a gala friday night that raised some 10 million euro .
perhaps more valuable , say city residents and aid workers , are people streaming in to help stack sandbags or offer food and drinks to those laboring against the flood waters .
" it 's such a great feeling , " says george mueller , 20 , who was evacuated from his home on tuesday .
" all the people are trying to help each other .
it 's amazing actually . "
just a few feet away , dozens of people are stacking sandbags at the entrances to the lower floors of the st. benno gynmnasium which , although relatively removed from the elbe river , is slowly filling with water .
they work methodically and quickly , stacking sandbags that came in on massive trucks carrying even more helpers .
sven schrick drove down from berlin with his wife thursday night to pitch in .
the heating technician says the couple is planning to go around the city until monday , volunteering where help is needed .
" nobody could anticipate this , " schrick says , before heading off to stack more sandbags .
" but by national catastrophes of this magnitude , as mr. schoeder said , we all need to come together . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .
rubberneckers and disaster tourists dresden 's streets have become impossible to navigate for cars and have instead filled with pedestrians and bicycles .
some brave the up to thigh-deep waters near the baroque semper opera , leaving small wakes of muddy water trailing behind them .
so-called disaster tourists film and snap away at them and the lakes surrounding the submerged zwinger palace , where workers just a day ago hurried to move pieces from the museum 's renowned porcelain collection to floors well above the flood waters .
massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .
electricity in most of the city has been shut down .
the worst appeared to be over for dresden on saturday , after the elbe showed signs of receding , said rainer waldner , who was heading the thw workers , part of a team of more than 4,000 , on site .
pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .
now , rather than moving ahead to restore it 's former glory , it must once again piece itself back together .
though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .
but dresdeners are tough , having rebuilt from the ashes before .
utter disbelief outside the sophienkeller , a subterranean restaurant across from the zwinger , a massive generator groans as architect dietmar matthes looks on helplessly .
the 245-seat restaurant has suffered massive damage , says matthes , who has gotten little sleep since the water started coming in on wednesday .
" you lay down for three , four hours , but ca n't sleep because you 're still so nervous , " he says .
matthes ends up spending most of his time as close to the sophienkeller as possible , stacking the occasional sandbag and hoping for the best .
the floods have prompted an unprecedented wave of generosity and aid for victims and those left homeless .
the mass-circulation daily bild newspaper and television station ard hosted a gala friday night that raised some 10 million euro .
perhaps more valuable , say city residents and aid workers , are people streaming in to help stack sandbags or offer food and drinks to those laboring against the flood waters .
" it 's such a great feeling , " says george mueller , 20 , who was evacuated from his home on tuesday .
" all the people are trying to help each other .
it 's amazing actually . "
just a few feet away , dozens of people are stacking sandbags at the entrances to the lower floors of the st. benno gynmnasium which , although relatively removed from the elbe river , is slowly filling with water .
they work methodically and quickly , stacking sandbags that came in on massive trucks carrying even more helpers .
sven schrick drove down from berlin with his wife thursday night to pitch in .
the heating technician says the couple is planning to go around the city until monday , volunteering where help is needed .
" nobody could anticipate this , " schrick says , before heading off to stack more sandbags .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .

massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .

pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .
now , rather than moving ahead to restore it 's former glory , it must once again piece itself back together .
though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .

the social worker had to make sure the 64 handicapped and elderly residents he cared for were brought out safely . the knocks on the door early wednesday morning came hard and loud . frank jesuiter was expecting them .
on tuesday night , he had watched with disbelief as a flood he was sure would not touch his apartment building in dresden ’ s historic district rose more than 3 meters -lrb- about 10 feet -rrb- .
by wednesday morning , city officials had decided it was time to move everyone out of the 12-story building . “ we had five minutes to get together all of our things and leave , ” jesuiter said . for the social worker , the panic was especially acute .
in addition to his own things , jesuiter and five of his colleagues were responsible for the medication and care of 64 psychologically impaired and elderly patients . he hurriedly gathered medication together , as police spread the word .
the patients began to panic .
as he packed , he wondered why they hadn ’ t had more time to get everything together . the elbe had been rising all night , after all , he thought to himself . “ they could have given us at least 15 or 20 minutes to take care of it all , ” he said .
“ you couldn ’ t forget things like your money or your wallet . ” where to next ? outside , a motor boat and six large police row boats had pulled up to evacuate the building 's 216 residents .
jesuiter watched with concern as eight of his elderly patients were handed through the windows onto the boats . they paddled and motored their way through an abandoned city .
as they passed the abandoned buildings of the old quarter , jesuiter wondered where they were headed to next . sport centers and schools across dresden have been turned into temporary shelters for evacuees in the past week .
overnight , tent cities have sprung up where families while away the hours until they can return home and assess the damage . “ we thought we were going to some tent camp , ” he said .
“ with sick people , with alcoholics , that would have been extremely strenuous . ” once on dry land , jesuiter met with the other caretakers and rescue officials .
they were able to secure housing in a sprawling , comfortable training center on the outskirts of the city center . fleeing the angry elbe the stay has been as relaxed as possible , says jesuiter .
but like thousands across dresden , he has begun wondering what will still be there when he returns home .
the walls will be moist beyond repair , he estimates .
his furniture , his bible collection , his lovely bulgarian rug are most likely all gone . “ i ’ ll just throw them away , ” he said . dresden has lost its charm for jesuiter , a resident since he moved from rostock in 1987 .
he plans to move some place further north , someplace higher .
the elbe , he says , is trying to find its old path , carved before people came and erected houses and office parks and cathedrals . “ the elbe has so much power now , ” he said , speaking as if the river was a living , breathing life form .
“ it wants to find its way back to these places . ” he said he is concerned his patients will think so as well .
the flood , the evacuations have all been traumatic for them .
he hopes to find them temporary shelter in hospitals and only return them to the apartment building when officials can assure there ’ s no more moistness or water damage . “ they can ’ t feel that they ’ re in a prison , ” he said . “ that the elbe will one day climb again and trap them . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a dw-world report direct from the scene . dresden - the sandbag line numbered some 15 people , all standing in thigh-high water doing their best to build a dam around the entrance to the parking garage of the recently rebuilt taschenberg palace , a commercial complex located just across from dresden 's historic zwinger palace .
the hotel 's basement , which is home to some well-known dresden restaurants , has already suffered an incalculable amount of damage , says general manager ronald i n'tveld .
now , the best the volunteers and the hotel 's 20 employees can do is attempt to keep the entire four floors of the parking garage from completely flooding and pushing even more water into the hotel 's subterranean floors .
" this is very very bad , " i n'tveld says .
" i 've seen the elbe rise , but never like this . "
in fact , no one has .
the 9.4 meter -lrb- roughly 31 feet -rrb- water-level mark the winding river hit in the early hours saturday morning broke a 157-year-old record and left dresden 's historic district and many of its surrounding neighborhoods swamped .
rubberneckers and disaster tourists dresden 's streets have become impossible to navigate for cars and have instead filled with pedestrians and bicycles .
some brave the up to thigh-deep waters near the baroque semper opera , leaving small wakes of muddy water trailing behind them .
so-called disaster tourists film and snap away at them and the lakes surrounding the submerged zwinger palace , where workers just a day ago hurried to move pieces from the museum 's renowned porcelain collection to floors well above the flood waters .
massive pumps from the fire department and german federal disaster relief agency thw -lrb- technische hilfswerke -rrb- are working overdrive to clear the zwinger 's basement of the silty water that just keeps on coming .
electricity in most of the city has been shut down .
the worst appeared to be over for dresden on saturday , after the elbe showed signs of receding , said rainer waldner , who was heading the thw workers , part of a team of more than 4,000 , on site .
pumps are in large demand and short supply currently in the flooded city .
the floods have come as a devastating psychological blow to dresden .
almost completely destroyed from fire bombing near the end of world war ii , the city had been deep in the midst of a dramatic restoration and reconstruction in the 12 years since the fall of the wall .
now , rather than moving ahead to restore it 's former glory , it must once again piece itself back together .
though water levels fell in dresden on saturday , they continued to surge downstream on both the elbe and mulde rivers .
flood waters are expected to reach the saxony-anhalt cities of magdeburg and dessau by sunday . 12 deaths , 21 missing in germany so far , this week 's massive flooding in germany has claimed 12 lives , including 11 in the state of saxony , which has been heavily impacted by the swelling elbe river .
an additional 21 people have been registered as missing .
at least 85 people have died across europe - from the black sea to the baltic - in this week 's unexpected summer cataclysm .
in addition to the disruption of human lives , the floods have also severed some of germany 's most important transportation arteries , including the high-speed rail lines that connect leipzig and dresden - eastern germany 's major business and industry hubs - with berlin , hamburg and munich .
a major rail bridge on the line between leipzig and dresden collapsed in the city of riesa on saturday .
there were no injuries , but the route will remain closed indefinitely .
thousands of thw volunteers , along with more than 10,000 german bundeswehr soldiers , are on the scene in cities and communities in the elbe 's downstream path , trying to minimize damage and safeguard sites with hazardous materials .
on saturday , more than 16,000 residents were evacuated as flood waters gushed into bitterfeld , but a chemical factory that had raised great concern among environmentalists has not been affected by flooding .
as other cities brace for the worst , dresden is about to face the inevitable chapter that follows natural disaster : the long and painful process of clean-up and rebuilding .
but dresdeners are tough , having rebuilt from the ashes before .
utter disbelief outside the sophienkeller , a subterranean restaurant across from the zwinger , a massive generator groans as architect dietmar matthes looks on helplessly .
the 245-seat restaurant has suffered massive damage , says matthes , who has gotten little sleep since the water started coming in on wednesday .
" you lay down for three , four hours , but ca n't sleep because you 're still so nervous , " he says .
matthes ends up spending most of his time as close to the sophienkeller as possible , stacking the occasional sandbag and hoping for the best .
the floods have prompted an unprecedented wave of generosity and aid for victims and those left homeless .
the mass-circulation daily bild newspaper and television station ard hosted a gala friday night that raised some 10 million euro .
perhaps more valuable , say city residents and aid workers , are people streaming in to help stack sandbags or offer food and drinks to those laboring against the flood waters .
" it 's such a great feeling , " says george mueller , 20 , who was evacuated from his home on tuesday .
" all the people are trying to help each other .
it 's amazing actually . "
just a few feet away , dozens of people are stacking sandbags at the entrances to the lower floors of the st. benno gynmnasium which , although relatively removed from the elbe river , is slowly filling with water .
they work methodically and quickly , stacking sandbags that came in on massive trucks carrying even more helpers .
sven schrick drove down from berlin with his wife thursday night to pitch in .
the heating technician says the couple is planning to go around the city until monday , volunteering where help is needed .

a " citizens ' council " is to be set up by the national institute for clinical excellence .
the group says it wants to hear what lay people have to say about the way their health service operates .
it is looking for 30 people from a cross section of the community in england and wales to give their opinions on the services provided by the nhs .
the council will meet twice a year for three consecutive days and be paid £ 150 a day .

vietnam 's annual flood season has started and the authorities are predicting it could be as bad as last year , when about 400 people died .
throughout most of the year , the dykes around hanoi provide a place to graze livestock or erect a thatched hut , ride a bike or grow a small crop .
but now the red-brown waters of the red river are lapping the trees and vietnamese families living within the dykes have gone to stay with relatives on dry land .
there are fears for the country 's rice crop and things are about to get a lot worse .
the government 's disaster management unit says hanoi has not had a major flood for decades but early in this year 's flood season it has announced that water levels are reaching alarm level three .
that means flood conditions are dangerous , dykes are threatened and the infrastructure is being damaged .
prime minister phan van khai has been meeting emergency officials and highlighted the importance of the hoa binh reservoir , the main dam which protects hanoi from flooding .
the gates have been raised to ease the pressure on the dykes but that reduces the ability of the dam to hold more flood waters .
there is also the risk of flooding from the red river 's main tributaries .
in theory , if the dykes break , the whole of hanoi will be flooded .
but the authorities have other stand-by plans .
the ancient bed of the day river could be used to divert flood waters , although 500,000 people would first have to be moved to safety .
there are also the traditional flooding areas - a network of natural depressions beyond the city which could be used as retarding basins .
the state media says almost 30 people have died in recent days from flooding in the northern , central and central highland regions of vietnam .
in the south , the mekong river has already reached last year 's august heights , reinforcing predictions that damage in the major rice growing areas could again be serious .

they are cycling to council offices throughout the region in an effort to highlight their financial plight to local politicians .
firefighters route llangefni , anglesey caernarfon , gwynedd conwy ruthin , denbighshire mold , flintshire wrexham the campaign - which starts in llangefni , anglesey and finishes in wrexham on tuesday - comes two days after a mass demonstration in swansea .
thousands of brigade members and their families attended the march on saturday .
firefighters want to change the top pay level of their salary from £ 21,500 to £ 30,000 .
industrial action could take place in october if the national firefighters ' pay body chooses to ignore the claim .
however , if industrial action is voted for , local fire stations across north wales will be manned by retained firefighters .
the men and women cover more of wales than any other group in the fire service and crew 60 % of fire appliances throughout the uk .
monday 's sponsored ride will take in the six unitary authorities which make up the north wales fire authority .
all money raised will be split between the fire service national benevolent fund and nightingale house hospice in wrexham .
john purser , brigade union secretary in north wales , was convinced the bike ride would get their message across .
" this bike ride is a great idea in that it raises valuable funds for charity and helps us to explain to the public how far firefighters have fallen behind in their pay .
" a number of my members are on state benefits as the wage of a fully qualified firefighter is £ 21,500 . "
the union has long wanted to change the way pay rises are awarded .
financial increases are currently linked to a formula agreed after the only national strike by firefighters - in 1977 - but the union now wants that system replaced .
during the 1977 strike , the army was brought in , and vehicles dubbed " green goddesses " were used to answer emergency calls for nine weeks .
