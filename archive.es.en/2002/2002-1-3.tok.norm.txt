in early asian trade the currency soared to 119.7 yen - its highest level since august 1999 - before settling back to around 119.45 yen . "
everything is working relatively smoothly , so we are seeing a relief rally in the euro " michael klawitter , senior currency strategist , westlb on wednesday the single european currency had posted its biggest ever one-day gains against the pound in early trade , climbing 2.7 % to 62.80p before slipping back to 62.40p.
the new currency also reached a two-week high of 90.66 us cents , but then dropped back to 90.40 in asian trade .
short-lived gains ?
analysts attributed the single currency 's strong performance to the smoother than expected introduction of euro notes and coins , which began on 1 january before the foreign exchange markets opened for the new year .
" so far everything is working relatively smoothly , and so we are seeing a relief rally in the euro , " said michael klawitter , senior currency strategist at westlb .
a survey on wednesday showing that the pace of output decline among eurozone companies slowed during december gave the single currency an added boost .
but analysts stressed that the euro was unlikely to hold onto its gains against the pound and dollar until there was firmer evidence of a sustained economic recovery in mainland europe .
" the fact is there is more confidence in the uk and in our economic management than there is in euroland and its economic management , " richard jeffrey , economist at ing barings told the bbc .
rate cuts unlikely for now the introduction of euro notes and coins proceeded with few disruptions on 2 january , the first full working day of the year .
the most serious glitch came when austria 's entire cash machine network went down for two hours due to excessive customer demand for the new euro notes .
an increase in the value of the euro against other world currencies would make goods imported into the eurozone cheaper , helping to drive down inflation .
this would make it easier for the european central bank to deliver more interest rate cuts , which some economists argue are urgently needed to stimulate the eurozone 's sluggish economy .
the european central bank 's governing board is due to vote on thursday on whether or not to change interest rates .
most economists do not expect a move until after the transition from the old european currencies to the euro is complete .

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- press chief 's ' abolish council ' outburst categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 3 january , 2002 , 07:53 gmt press chief 's ' abolish council ' outburst the council has hit back at criticism the former head of communications at a troubled council in north wales has hit out at his former employees by saying that the existing political body should be abolished .
in an interview on radio cymru on thursday , gwyn llewelyn accused anglesey county councillors of being " constantly engaged in petty party politics " .
the only thing i feel would work is to completely abolish the council gwyn llewelyn speaking on beti a 'i phobol , mr llewelyn also said present members of the council should be prevented from standing again .
but leader of anglesey county council goronwy parry dismissed the outspoken comments and said if people wanted to get rid of councillors , they could do so at election time .
controversy at the council came to light when housing chief john arthur jones was dismissed in a 1998 after a fiercely critical audit report .
some members were angered when he was given a £ 43,000 settlement - shortly after a court case against him , involving allegations of misconduct in public office and intimidating , collapsed .
mr llewelyn , a journalist and novelist , claimed the authority should be scrapped following such allegations of serious mismanagement .
he also claimed the council was split from top to bottom .
party politics " the only thing i feel would work on anglesey is something revolutionary and foward-thinking , which is n't going to happen - to completely abolsh the council , " he said .
" no-one who is a member can stand again .
mr llewelyn wants wholesale change " my feeling is that the people deserve better . "
his views are bound to cause deep embarrassment and raise serious questions about how much has changed at the council in the last four years since the damning district auditor 's report was published .
' suprising outburst ' goronwy parry said that he was " surprised at the outburst " .
" it 's upsetting - it gives opportunities for other people to target the council , " he said .
" it would be wrong to abolish the council at this time on one viewpoint . "
he went on to say that the council had taken strides forward to improve performance , implementing recommendations given by the uk government .
but , he said , work remained tricky , with baggage from the past causing difficulties .
" there are those who do n't share the views of the majority of members and take advantage of circumstances to make mischief , " he added . watch / listen on this story gwyn llewellyn , former anglesey press chief " the only thing to work is to abolish the council " goronwy parry , council leader " it would be wrong to abolish the council " bbc wales 's rhodri lewis " mr llywelyn 's comments come four years after a highly critical report into the council " see also : 18 mar 00 -pipe- wales anglesey agrees oil depot sale 27 nov 99 -pipe- wales labour calls for plaid inquiry 16 nov 01 -pipe- wales island exodus under spotlight 03 oct 00 -pipe- wales council officer 's settlement defended 06 sep 99 -pipe- wales former housing chief denies misconduct internet links : anglesey council the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : soap actor killed in holiday fall wales leads uk bust firms league husband jailed for rape attack festival town prepares for euros plea for more kidney donors rowing team arrives back in uk families opt for single jabs hain turns fire on greens links to more wales stories are at the foot of the page .
