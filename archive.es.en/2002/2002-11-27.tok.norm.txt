program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.11.2002 germany still wary of turkey 's eu aspirations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its large turkish population makes germany 's position on turkey 's eu membership a difficult one turkish president ahmet sezer is in berlin to rally support for eu membership .
but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold . a week after the leader of turkey ’ s new ruling party , tayyip erdogan , met german chancellor gerhard schröder , it ’ s now the turn of turkish president ahmet sezer -lrb- photo -rrb- to pay his regards in berlin and shore up support for his nation ’ s european union bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet necdet sezer turkey is pushing the eu to name a date for starting negotiations on accession to the european union at the copenhagen summit next month .
the visit is especially important for ankara , which sees berlin as a key partner in helping it secure a place in brussels .
germany is home to the largest turkish population in europe -lrb- 2.5 million -rrb- and has maintained close relations with ankara for decades .
german parties split over membership for turkey but despite those advantageous factors , the going will be anything but smooth for president sezer .
recent weeks have seen germany ’ s main political parties sharply divided over whether a muslim state of 66 million people should be permitted into a european union that is largely christian .
while the opposition christian democrats fear that admitting an islamic country would rock the balance in what they see as europe ’ s christian heritage , chancellor schröder ’ s ruling social democrat-green coalition government welcomes the idea and banks on the strategic advantage of future turkish membership .
conservatives see turkey as " too different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber speaking on friday before a christian social union party congress , former conservative chancellor candidate edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " europe is a community that is based on western values .
as a community of shared values , europe has to deal with the question of its borders .
these borders must be based on shared values , culture and history .
turkey ’ s membership would breach these borders . "
conservative german politicians argue that the cultural and religious differences between turkey and the european union are insurmountable .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the premier of the state of hessen , said in a television interview recently , " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that ’ s a european tradition .
of course , we can ’ t blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we mustn ’ t ignore that fact . "
greens and spd say turkey is " unique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth claudia roth -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the ruling green party thinks that such an argument is " dangerous " .
" if you define europe as ' christian , ' that would also exclude millions , millions of moslems who are already in the european union , " she said .
" it ’ s the second-biggest religious group within the eu already . "
the social democrats are instead trying to portray turkey as an shining example of a unique muslim state where islam and modernity can go hand in hand .
" we in europe see how turkey proves that islam and democracy can be reconciled in a society where state and religion are seperate .
this is a great hope which we should support because it 's a unique case , " a foreign policy spokesman of the spd said .
more problems for germany with turkish accession ?
but away from the delicate question of european heritage and identity , other factors , too , have germany ’ s political parties worried .
germany ’ s conservative parties fear that turkish membership would open the flood gates to a wave of many more muslim immigrants to join families in german cities .
turkey 's failure to fulfill all criteria for eu membership on issues including its human rights record , the rights of its kurdish minority and the cyprus conflict , also remains a matter of concern for parties across the political spectrum .
anti-turkish rumblings across europe the hard-line stance against turkey among germany 's opposition politicians has been echoed across europe .
the current debate started after valéry giscard d 'estaing , the head of the convent charged with drafting a european constitution , made controversial statements earlier this month . giscard d 'estaing remarked that turkey is not a " european country " and that it 's accession would bring about an " end of the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.11.2002 berlin sends mixed signals on iraq issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel used patriot missiles with limited success in 1991 suspense mounted as chancellor schröder said " yes " to delivery of patriot missiles to israel and flyover rights for u.s. forces in a war against iraq , but turned down a u.s. request for use of german armored vehicles . the fog seems to be gradually lifting on a tricky defense debate that has occupied the german government for weeks and provided ample ammunition to the conservative opposition .
after days of intense speculation , unconfirmed media reports and a slew of allegations regarding germany ’ s exact role in the case of military action against iraq and military requests from israel , chancellor gerhard schröder has finally spoken out in clear and unambiguous language .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in extracts of a newspaper interview released on tuesday , chancellor schröder confirmed that germany will provide israel with anti-missile systems .
" if the israeli government feels it needs this added security , we will help - and promptly , " schröder told the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" this is our moral and historical obligation ...
the security of the israeli state and its citizens is of utmost importance to us . "
patriot missiles only for defense purposes at the same time the chancellor stressed that the patriot missiles were purely defensive weapons .
" they offer protection against missile attacks .
the security of the state of israel and its citizens is of prime importance to us , " he said .
the social democrat foreign expert , gernot erler defended the government 's plan to deliver missiles to israel .
he said the request from jerusalem had nothing to do with a u.s. request for german support in a war against iraq .
the german defense ministry said israel had long ago expressed interest in acquiring new surplus patriot missiles from germany and had renewed its request a week ago .
the israeli embassy said the request was made a year ago , but that it had taken on a new urgency due to the looming iraq crisis .
israel is preparing for possible retaliation from iraq in the event of u.s. military action against the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs the u.s.-built patriots are designed to intercept and shoot down incoming ballistic missiles and have a limited range .
additionally , the fact that the distance between iraq and israel is small , means that the early warning period is short .
in military circles there is a agreement that every additional defense system improves security according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
in the 1991 gulf war iraq fired 39 scud missiles at israel , though the missiles have been updated since then .
german military supply to israel a sensitive issue though the chancellor ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens have denied that such a military delivery to israel would conflict with their vocal opposition to any future u.s.-led war against iraq , there are indications that the issue is a delicate one .
the deputy head of the social democrats , michael müller described israel ’ s request as " sensitive " and said that it would land the coalition in a difficult situation .
the request , he said couldn ’ t just be answered with a " simple nod of the head " .
even green party parliamentary leader winfried hermann is concerned that chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer ’ s emphasis that germany will not take part in military action against iraq , could now be interpreted loosely .
he said that the delivery is " part of a whole concept of germany 's indirect participation in a military exchange . "
hermann told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau that the german government should " keep their fingers off it . "
schröder says " no " to u.s. request for fuchs vehicles meanwhile in a news conference on wednesday chancellor schröder also shed more light on the much-speculated wish-list of the united states on german support in a war against iraq .
the chancellor confirmed that germany had agreed to grant flyover rights for u.s. forces and transport troops through germany in the event of military action against iraq .
he also said that washington had asked berlin to specifically provide defense systems against chemical , biological and nuclear attack as well as military police , missile defense systems and financial and material help for possible reconstruction of iraq .
but schröder made it clear that germany would refuse the use of its fuchs armored vehicles stationed in kuwait for any u.s-led military action against iraq . # b # he told reporters it remained " clear as glass " that the german parliament had only allowed a mandate for a twelve-month deployment in the " enduring freedom " action in the war against international terrorism .
" we don ’ t have the intention of moving away from this mandate , " he said .
germany will not be part of a military intervention in iraq , he added .
fuchs for israel but no more the german chancellor also said that germany would also fulfill another israeli request of providing some of its fuchs armored vehicles , which are equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination since there would be use to protect israel ’ s own population .
but schröder ruled out any further military help to israel .
" we do not intend to provide further resources beyond what i have said , and definitely no more personnel , " schröder said .
asked if germany would help rebuild iraq after a war , schröder said , " we expect that there will be no need for a military intervention and that is the german government ’ s political goal , and i think it would be wrong to assume the country will have to be rebuilt . "
schröder ’ s clear statements lay to rest speculation over the mission of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible u.s.-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
schröder criticised for stance on u.s. schröder ’ s permission for u.s. forces to use german airspace and allow them transit rights within germany in the event of war against iraq has led to criticism even within the ruling coalition .
angelika beer , the green party ’ s expert on defense matters questioned the legitimacy of the decision .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
germany ’ s conservative opposition has shown itself to be unsatisfied with chancellor schröder ’ s method of dealing with u.s. requests .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert of the christian democratic party said that the chancellor ’ s explanations were not satisfactory .
the parliamentary chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , wolfgang gerhardt said that schröder ’ s explanations do not end the discussion within the ruling coalition .
there are now fears that schröder ’ s categorical refusal in letting the u.s. use its fuchs vehicles might throw a shadow on already strained u.s.-german relations that were beginning to show signs of improvement of late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government in disarray over iraq there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .
hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .
struck also remained adamant that he would not send more troops to kuwait .
as if to highlight the spd 's internal disarray , struck 's own parliamentary state secretary , hans georg wagner , contradicted his minister , saying that the german troops and tanks would " naturally " be deployed in the event of an attack .
greens warn against involvement while the greens concede the possible use of the troops in kuwait , they remain firmly opposed to any other involvement in a possible war .
winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .
breach of international law ?
meanwhile , angelika beer , the greens ' expert on defense matters , questioned the legitimacy of chancellor gerhard schröder 's stance on allowing washington to use german airspace or u.s bases here in the event of a war .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
political pundits attribute schröder 's victory in september 's general election to his hardline anti-war stance .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .
hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .
struck also remained adamant that he would not send more troops to kuwait .

after days of intense speculation , unconfirmed media reports and a slew of allegations regarding germany ’ s exact role in the case of military action against iraq and military requests from israel , chancellor gerhard schröder has finally spoken out in clear and unambiguous language .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in extracts of a newspaper interview released on tuesday , chancellor schröder confirmed that germany will provide israel with anti-missile systems .
" if the israeli government feels it needs this added security , we will help - and promptly , " schröder told the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" this is our moral and historical obligation ...
the security of the israeli state and its citizens is of utmost importance to us . "

" they offer protection against missile attacks .
the security of the state of israel and its citizens is of prime importance to us , " he said .
the social democrat foreign expert , gernot erler defended the government 's plan to deliver missiles to israel .
he said the request from jerusalem had nothing to do with a u.s. request for german support in a war against iraq .
the german defense ministry said israel had long ago expressed interest in acquiring new surplus patriot missiles from germany and had renewed its request a week ago .
the israeli embassy said the request was made a year ago , but that it had taken on a new urgency due to the looming iraq crisis .
israel is preparing for possible retaliation from iraq in the event of u.s. military action against the country .

the request , he said couldn ’ t just be answered with a " simple nod of the head " .
even green party parliamentary leader winfried hermann is concerned that chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer ’ s emphasis that germany will not take part in military action against iraq , could now be interpreted loosely .
he said that the delivery is " part of a whole concept of germany 's indirect participation in a military exchange . "
hermann told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau that the german government should " keep their fingers off it . "
schröder says " no " to u.s. request for fuchs vehicles meanwhile in a news conference on wednesday chancellor schröder also shed more light on the much-speculated wish-list of the united states on german support in a war against iraq .
the chancellor confirmed that germany had agreed to grant flyover rights for u.s. forces and transport troops through germany in the event of military action against iraq .
he also said that washington had asked berlin to specifically provide defense systems against chemical , biological and nuclear attack as well as military police , missile defense systems and financial and material help for possible reconstruction of iraq .
but schröder made it clear that germany would refuse the use of its fuchs armored vehicles stationed in kuwait for any u.s-led military action against iraq . # b # he told reporters it remained " clear as glass " that the german parliament had only allowed a mandate for a twelve-month deployment in the " enduring freedom " action in the war against international terrorism .
" we don ’ t have the intention of moving away from this mandate , " he said .
germany will not be part of a military intervention in iraq , he added .
fuchs for israel but no more the german chancellor also said that germany would also fulfill another israeli request of providing some of its fuchs armored vehicles , which are equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination since there would be use to protect israel ’ s own population .
but schröder ruled out any further military help to israel .
" we do not intend to provide further resources beyond what i have said , and definitely no more personnel , " schröder said .
asked if germany would help rebuild iraq after a war , schröder said , " we expect that there will be no need for a military intervention and that is the german government ’ s political goal , and i think it would be wrong to assume the country will have to be rebuilt . "
schröder ’ s clear statements lay to rest speculation over the mission of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible u.s.-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
schröder criticised for stance on u.s. schröder ’ s permission for u.s. forces to use german airspace and allow them transit rights within germany in the event of war against iraq has led to criticism even within the ruling coalition .
angelika beer , the green party ’ s expert on defense matters questioned the legitimacy of the decision .

defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .

the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .

except in germany a german state 's plan to become the first to allow residents to bury their dead in their backyards is upsetting politicians and preachers alike . it 's the final choice you 'll make - what happens to your mortal remains after death has claimed you .
in germany , however , the living have rather limited choices .
burial or cremation in cemeteries are the only options on offer , with coffins and urns being the recommended and enforced method of internment .
but now , the government in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia wants to relax the rules for its dearly departed .
the plans on the table will allow people to bury their dead in their yards or keep the ashes of loved ones on the mantelpiece .
such things might be common practice in many countries , but in germany such suggestions have angered church authorities and conservative politicians who say changing the rules would be disrespectful to the dead .
but these days , many people believe they should have the choice to decide for themselves .
my bookshelf , my tomb bernd bruns , a craftsman from düsseldorf , does n't want to be buried in a cemetery when he dies .
his preference is to be cremated and have his ashes placed in an urn that will be kept in the home he has shared with his wife for most of his life .
bruns has been fighting for many years for the right to spend eternity looking down from his bookshelf .
" i 'd like to remain at home in the surroundings where i 've spent most of my time .
and i 'm not the only one who 'd like to do that , " bernd said in an interview with dw-tv .
he feels so strongly about the issue that he 's set up a popular web site , which provides tips on how to get around burial red tape and have your last wishes carried out to the letter .
standard practice in holland in the netherlands , widely recognized as the most " pro-choice " nation within europe , the dutch have already been granted more of a choice when it comes to planning that final resting place .
they can bury them in the cemetery , in their garden , at a private mausoleum or cast the cremated ashes to the four winds .
an urn is supplied after cremation only if the deceased had made provision for it in the will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt : not buried in the garden .
but this liberal attitude championed by bernd bruns , his supporters and the dutch is not shared by all .
there are many people who believe the dead have their place in consecrated ground and not in the back garden or house to be found by future unsuspecting generations .
günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says . " they may just think that it 's been sitting there quite a while and hand it over to the public sanitation services where it ends up in the rubbish . "
current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .
germany 's churches state that a coffin is mandatory and that even shrouding the corpse is against burial laws .
the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .
since exhumation is also strictly forbidden under islam and bodies must be buried as soon as possible , 90 percent of germany 's muslims are flown to islamic sites to be buried once they die .
germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .
" i 'm not concerned that lots of people are going to want to be buried without a coffin , " he told dw-tv .
" but it could help certain ethnic groups such as muslims - and why should n't we make some concessions to people from these religious communities when it does us no harm at all . "
the body should be returned to god , says church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church believes consecrated is best .
" judeo-christian tradition states that the remains of the dead should not be placed under our own control or those affiliated with us but should be returned to the hand of god ... through consecrated ground , " says father schwab of the protestant church in germany rhineland .
a decision date has yet to be set and the debate is likely to rage on even then .
however , after his years of campaigning , bernd bruns feels confident enough to have already bought an urn that he says fits very well in his bookcase . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de final farewell icy winds coursed through the british capital , making the line of people queing on lambeth bridge shiver as the crowd waited solemnly for the queen mother to pass .

but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold . a week after the leader of turkey ’ s new ruling party , tayyip erdogan , met german chancellor gerhard schröder , it ’ s now the turn of turkish president ahmet sezer -lrb- photo -rrb- to pay his regards in berlin and shore up support for his nation ’ s european union bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet necdet sezer turkey is pushing the eu to name a date for starting negotiations on accession to the european union at the copenhagen summit next month .
the visit is especially important for ankara , which sees berlin as a key partner in helping it secure a place in brussels .
germany is home to the largest turkish population in europe -lrb- 2.5 million -rrb- and has maintained close relations with ankara for decades .
german parties split over membership for turkey but despite those advantageous factors , the going will be anything but smooth for president sezer .
recent weeks have seen germany ’ s main political parties sharply divided over whether a muslim state of 66 million people should be permitted into a european union that is largely christian .
while the opposition christian democrats fear that admitting an islamic country would rock the balance in what they see as europe ’ s christian heritage , chancellor schröder ’ s ruling social democrat-green coalition government welcomes the idea and banks on the strategic advantage of future turkish membership .

" if you define europe as ' christian , ' that would also exclude millions , millions of moslems who are already in the european union , " she said .
" it ’ s the second-biggest religious group within the eu already . "
the social democrats are instead trying to portray turkey as an shining example of a unique muslim state where islam and modernity can go hand in hand .

after days of intense speculation , unconfirmed media reports and a slew of allegations regarding germany ’ s exact role in the case of military action against iraq and military requests from israel , chancellor gerhard schröder has finally spoken out in clear and unambiguous language .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in extracts of a newspaper interview released on tuesday , chancellor schröder confirmed that germany will provide israel with anti-missile systems .
" if the israeli government feels it needs this added security , we will help - and promptly , " schröder told the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" this is our moral and historical obligation ...
the security of the israeli state and its citizens is of utmost importance to us . "
patriot missiles only for defense purposes at the same time the chancellor stressed that the patriot missiles were purely defensive weapons .
" they offer protection against missile attacks .
the security of the state of israel and its citizens is of prime importance to us , " he said .
the social democrat foreign expert , gernot erler defended the government 's plan to deliver missiles to israel .
he said the request from jerusalem had nothing to do with a u.s. request for german support in a war against iraq .
the german defense ministry said israel had long ago expressed interest in acquiring new surplus patriot missiles from germany and had renewed its request a week ago .
the israeli embassy said the request was made a year ago , but that it had taken on a new urgency due to the looming iraq crisis .
israel is preparing for possible retaliation from iraq in the event of u.s. military action against the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs the u.s.-built patriots are designed to intercept and shoot down incoming ballistic missiles and have a limited range .
additionally , the fact that the distance between iraq and israel is small , means that the early warning period is short .
in military circles there is a agreement that every additional defense system improves security according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
in the 1991 gulf war iraq fired 39 scud missiles at israel , though the missiles have been updated since then .
german military supply to israel a sensitive issue though the chancellor ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens have denied that such a military delivery to israel would conflict with their vocal opposition to any future u.s.-led war against iraq , there are indications that the issue is a delicate one .
the deputy head of the social democrats , michael müller described israel ’ s request as " sensitive " and said that it would land the coalition in a difficult situation .
the request , he said couldn ’ t just be answered with a " simple nod of the head " .
even green party parliamentary leader winfried hermann is concerned that chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer ’ s emphasis that germany will not take part in military action against iraq , could now be interpreted loosely .
he said that the delivery is " part of a whole concept of germany 's indirect participation in a military exchange . "
hermann told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau that the german government should " keep their fingers off it . "
schröder says " no " to u.s. request for fuchs vehicles meanwhile in a news conference on wednesday chancellor schröder also shed more light on the much-speculated wish-list of the united states on german support in a war against iraq .
the chancellor confirmed that germany had agreed to grant flyover rights for u.s. forces and transport troops through germany in the event of military action against iraq .
he also said that washington had asked berlin to specifically provide defense systems against chemical , biological and nuclear attack as well as military police , missile defense systems and financial and material help for possible reconstruction of iraq .
but schröder made it clear that germany would refuse the use of its fuchs armored vehicles stationed in kuwait for any u.s-led military action against iraq . # b # he told reporters it remained " clear as glass " that the german parliament had only allowed a mandate for a twelve-month deployment in the " enduring freedom " action in the war against international terrorism .
" we don ’ t have the intention of moving away from this mandate , " he said .
germany will not be part of a military intervention in iraq , he added .
fuchs for israel but no more the german chancellor also said that germany would also fulfill another israeli request of providing some of its fuchs armored vehicles , which are equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination since there would be use to protect israel ’ s own population .
but schröder ruled out any further military help to israel .
" we do not intend to provide further resources beyond what i have said , and definitely no more personnel , " schröder said .
asked if germany would help rebuild iraq after a war , schröder said , " we expect that there will be no need for a military intervention and that is the german government ’ s political goal , and i think it would be wrong to assume the country will have to be rebuilt . "
schröder ’ s clear statements lay to rest speculation over the mission of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible u.s.-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
schröder criticised for stance on u.s. schröder ’ s permission for u.s. forces to use german airspace and allow them transit rights within germany in the event of war against iraq has led to criticism even within the ruling coalition .
angelika beer , the green party ’ s expert on defense matters questioned the legitimacy of the decision .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
germany ’ s conservative opposition has shown itself to be unsatisfied with chancellor schröder ’ s method of dealing with u.s. requests .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert of the christian democratic party said that the chancellor ’ s explanations were not satisfactory .
the parliamentary chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , wolfgang gerhardt said that schröder ’ s explanations do not end the discussion within the ruling coalition .

except in germany a german state 's plan to become the first to allow residents to bury their dead in their backyards is upsetting politicians and preachers alike . it 's the final choice you 'll make - what happens to your mortal remains after death has claimed you .
in germany , however , the living have rather limited choices .
burial or cremation in cemeteries are the only options on offer , with coffins and urns being the recommended and enforced method of internment .
but now , the government in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia wants to relax the rules for its dearly departed .
the plans on the table will allow people to bury their dead in their yards or keep the ashes of loved ones on the mantelpiece .
such things might be common practice in many countries , but in germany such suggestions have angered church authorities and conservative politicians who say changing the rules would be disrespectful to the dead .
but these days , many people believe they should have the choice to decide for themselves .
my bookshelf , my tomb bernd bruns , a craftsman from düsseldorf , does n't want to be buried in a cemetery when he dies .
his preference is to be cremated and have his ashes placed in an urn that will be kept in the home he has shared with his wife for most of his life .
bruns has been fighting for many years for the right to spend eternity looking down from his bookshelf .
" i 'd like to remain at home in the surroundings where i 've spent most of my time .
and i 'm not the only one who 'd like to do that , " bernd said in an interview with dw-tv .
he feels so strongly about the issue that he 's set up a popular web site , which provides tips on how to get around burial red tape and have your last wishes carried out to the letter .
standard practice in holland in the netherlands , widely recognized as the most " pro-choice " nation within europe , the dutch have already been granted more of a choice when it comes to planning that final resting place .
they can bury them in the cemetery , in their garden , at a private mausoleum or cast the cremated ashes to the four winds .
an urn is supplied after cremation only if the deceased had made provision for it in the will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt : not buried in the garden .
but this liberal attitude championed by bernd bruns , his supporters and the dutch is not shared by all .
there are many people who believe the dead have their place in consecrated ground and not in the back garden or house to be found by future unsuspecting generations .
günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says . " they may just think that it 's been sitting there quite a while and hand it over to the public sanitation services where it ends up in the rubbish . "
current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .
germany 's churches state that a coffin is mandatory and that even shrouding the corpse is against burial laws .
the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .
since exhumation is also strictly forbidden under islam and bodies must be buried as soon as possible , 90 percent of germany 's muslims are flown to islamic sites to be buried once they die .
germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .
" i 'm not concerned that lots of people are going to want to be buried without a coffin , " he told dw-tv .
" but it could help certain ethnic groups such as muslims - and why should n't we make some concessions to people from these religious communities when it does us no harm at all . "
the body should be returned to god , says church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church believes consecrated is best .
" judeo-christian tradition states that the remains of the dead should not be placed under our own control or those affiliated with us but should be returned to the hand of god ... through consecrated ground , " says father schwab of the protestant church in germany rhineland .
a decision date has yet to be set and the debate is likely to rage on even then .
however , after his years of campaigning , bernd bruns feels confident enough to have already bought an urn that he says fits very well in his bookcase . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de final farewell icy winds coursed through the british capital , making the line of people queing on lambeth bridge shiver as the crowd waited solemnly for the queen mother to pass .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.11.2002 germany still wary of turkey 's eu aspirations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its large turkish population makes germany 's position on turkey 's eu membership a difficult one turkish president ahmet sezer is in berlin to rally support for eu membership .
but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold . a week after the leader of turkey ’ s new ruling party , tayyip erdogan , met german chancellor gerhard schröder , it ’ s now the turn of turkish president ahmet sezer -lrb- photo -rrb- to pay his regards in berlin and shore up support for his nation ’ s european union bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet necdet sezer turkey is pushing the eu to name a date for starting negotiations on accession to the european union at the copenhagen summit next month .
the visit is especially important for ankara , which sees berlin as a key partner in helping it secure a place in brussels .
germany is home to the largest turkish population in europe -lrb- 2.5 million -rrb- and has maintained close relations with ankara for decades .
german parties split over membership for turkey but despite those advantageous factors , the going will be anything but smooth for president sezer .
recent weeks have seen germany ’ s main political parties sharply divided over whether a muslim state of 66 million people should be permitted into a european union that is largely christian .
while the opposition christian democrats fear that admitting an islamic country would rock the balance in what they see as europe ’ s christian heritage , chancellor schröder ’ s ruling social democrat-green coalition government welcomes the idea and banks on the strategic advantage of future turkish membership .
conservatives see turkey as " too different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber speaking on friday before a christian social union party congress , former conservative chancellor candidate edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " europe is a community that is based on western values .
as a community of shared values , europe has to deal with the question of its borders .
these borders must be based on shared values , culture and history .
turkey ’ s membership would breach these borders . "
conservative german politicians argue that the cultural and religious differences between turkey and the european union are insurmountable .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the premier of the state of hessen , said in a television interview recently , " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that ’ s a european tradition .
of course , we can ’ t blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we mustn ’ t ignore that fact . "
greens and spd say turkey is " unique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth claudia roth -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the ruling green party thinks that such an argument is " dangerous " .
" if you define europe as ' christian , ' that would also exclude millions , millions of moslems who are already in the european union , " she said .
" it ’ s the second-biggest religious group within the eu already . "
the social democrats are instead trying to portray turkey as an shining example of a unique muslim state where islam and modernity can go hand in hand .
" we in europe see how turkey proves that islam and democracy can be reconciled in a society where state and religion are seperate .
this is a great hope which we should support because it 's a unique case , " a foreign policy spokesman of the spd said .
more problems for germany with turkish accession ?
but away from the delicate question of european heritage and identity , other factors , too , have germany ’ s political parties worried .
germany ’ s conservative parties fear that turkish membership would open the flood gates to a wave of many more muslim immigrants to join families in german cities .
turkey 's failure to fulfill all criteria for eu membership on issues including its human rights record , the rights of its kurdish minority and the cyprus conflict , also remains a matter of concern for parties across the political spectrum .
anti-turkish rumblings across europe the hard-line stance against turkey among germany 's opposition politicians has been echoed across europe .
the current debate started after valéry giscard d 'estaing , the head of the convent charged with drafting a european constitution , made controversial statements earlier this month . giscard d 'estaing remarked that turkey is not a " european country " and that it 's accession would bring about an " end of the eu . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish leader rallies berlin 's support for eu negotiations recep tayyip erdogan is on a whirlwind tour of european capitals to build support for future turkish eu membership .
but even strong u.s. support is no guarantee of a concrete commitment from brussels .

germany is home to the largest turkish population in europe -lrb- 2.5 million -rrb- and has maintained close relations with ankara for decades .
german parties split over membership for turkey but despite those advantageous factors , the going will be anything but smooth for president sezer .
recent weeks have seen germany ’ s main political parties sharply divided over whether a muslim state of 66 million people should be permitted into a european union that is largely christian .
while the opposition christian democrats fear that admitting an islamic country would rock the balance in what they see as europe ’ s christian heritage , chancellor schröder ’ s ruling social democrat-green coalition government welcomes the idea and banks on the strategic advantage of future turkish membership .
conservatives see turkey as " too different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber speaking on friday before a christian social union party congress , former conservative chancellor candidate edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " europe is a community that is based on western values .
as a community of shared values , europe has to deal with the question of its borders .
these borders must be based on shared values , culture and history .
turkey ’ s membership would breach these borders . "
conservative german politicians argue that the cultural and religious differences between turkey and the european union are insurmountable .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the premier of the state of hessen , said in a television interview recently , " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that ’ s a european tradition .
of course , we can ’ t blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we mustn ’ t ignore that fact . "
greens and spd say turkey is " unique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth claudia roth -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the ruling green party thinks that such an argument is " dangerous " .
" if you define europe as ' christian , ' that would also exclude millions , millions of moslems who are already in the european union , " she said .
" it ’ s the second-biggest religious group within the eu already . "
the social democrats are instead trying to portray turkey as an shining example of a unique muslim state where islam and modernity can go hand in hand .
" we in europe see how turkey proves that islam and democracy can be reconciled in a society where state and religion are seperate .
this is a great hope which we should support because it 's a unique case , " a foreign policy spokesman of the spd said .
more problems for germany with turkish accession ?
but away from the delicate question of european heritage and identity , other factors , too , have germany ’ s political parties worried .
germany ’ s conservative parties fear that turkish membership would open the flood gates to a wave of many more muslim immigrants to join families in german cities .
turkey 's failure to fulfill all criteria for eu membership on issues including its human rights record , the rights of its kurdish minority and the cyprus conflict , also remains a matter of concern for parties across the political spectrum .
anti-turkish rumblings across europe the hard-line stance against turkey among germany 's opposition politicians has been echoed across europe .
the current debate started after valéry giscard d 'estaing , the head of the convent charged with drafting a european constitution , made controversial statements earlier this month . giscard d 'estaing remarked that turkey is not a " european country " and that it 's accession would bring about an " end of the eu .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .
hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .
struck also remained adamant that he would not send more troops to kuwait .
as if to highlight the spd 's internal disarray , struck 's own parliamentary state secretary , hans georg wagner , contradicted his minister , saying that the german troops and tanks would " naturally " be deployed in the event of an attack .
greens warn against involvement while the greens concede the possible use of the troops in kuwait , they remain firmly opposed to any other involvement in a possible war .
winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .
breach of international law ?
meanwhile , angelika beer , the greens ' expert on defense matters , questioned the legitimacy of chancellor gerhard schröder 's stance on allowing washington to use german airspace or u.s bases here in the event of a war .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
political pundits attribute schröder 's victory in september 's general election to his hardline anti-war stance .

as if to highlight the spd 's internal disarray , struck 's own parliamentary state secretary , hans georg wagner , contradicted his minister , saying that the german troops and tanks would " naturally " be deployed in the event of an attack .
greens warn against involvement while the greens concede the possible use of the troops in kuwait , they remain firmly opposed to any other involvement in a possible war .
winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .
breach of international law ?
meanwhile , angelika beer , the greens ' expert on defense matters , questioned the legitimacy of chancellor gerhard schröder 's stance on allowing washington to use german airspace or u.s bases here in the event of a war .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
political pundits attribute schröder 's victory in september 's general election to his hardline anti-war stance .
however the conservative opposition says schröder will be forced to choose between breaking that promise , thereby deceiving the electorate , or risk further damaging us - german relations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates kuwait mandate germany ’ s defense minister has announced that german soldiers and tanks will stay in kuwait for six more months .
the greens are against such an extension and demand the troops ’ removal in the event of a war on iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.11.2002 german government in disarray over iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense minister peter struck -lrb- right -rrb- may not have much to laugh about if an iraqi war becomes reality .
there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .
hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .
struck also remained adamant that he would not send more troops to kuwait .
as if to highlight the spd 's internal disarray , struck 's own parliamentary state secretary , hans georg wagner , contradicted his minister , saying that the german troops and tanks would " naturally " be deployed in the event of an attack .
greens warn against involvement while the greens concede the possible use of the troops in kuwait , they remain firmly opposed to any other involvement in a possible war .
winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .
breach of international law ?
meanwhile , angelika beer , the greens ' expert on defense matters , questioned the legitimacy of chancellor gerhard schröder 's stance on allowing washington to use german airspace or u.s bases here in the event of a war .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
political pundits attribute schröder 's victory in september 's general election to his hardline anti-war stance .
however the conservative opposition says schröder will be forced to choose between breaking that promise , thereby deceiving the electorate , or risk further damaging us - german relations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates kuwait mandate germany ’ s defense minister has announced that german soldiers and tanks will stay in kuwait for six more months .
the greens are against such an extension and demand the troops ’ removal in the event of a war on iraq .

after days of intense speculation , unconfirmed media reports and a slew of allegations regarding germany ’ s exact role in the case of military action against iraq and military requests from israel , chancellor gerhard schröder has finally spoken out in clear and unambiguous language .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in extracts of a newspaper interview released on tuesday , chancellor schröder confirmed that germany will provide israel with anti-missile systems .
" if the israeli government feels it needs this added security , we will help - and promptly , " schröder told the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" this is our moral and historical obligation ...
the security of the israeli state and its citizens is of utmost importance to us . "
patriot missiles only for defense purposes at the same time the chancellor stressed that the patriot missiles were purely defensive weapons .
" they offer protection against missile attacks .
the security of the state of israel and its citizens is of prime importance to us , " he said .
the social democrat foreign expert , gernot erler defended the government 's plan to deliver missiles to israel .
he said the request from jerusalem had nothing to do with a u.s. request for german support in a war against iraq .
the german defense ministry said israel had long ago expressed interest in acquiring new surplus patriot missiles from germany and had renewed its request a week ago .
the israeli embassy said the request was made a year ago , but that it had taken on a new urgency due to the looming iraq crisis .
israel is preparing for possible retaliation from iraq in the event of u.s. military action against the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs the u.s.-built patriots are designed to intercept and shoot down incoming ballistic missiles and have a limited range .
additionally , the fact that the distance between iraq and israel is small , means that the early warning period is short .
in military circles there is a agreement that every additional defense system improves security according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
in the 1991 gulf war iraq fired 39 scud missiles at israel , though the missiles have been updated since then .
german military supply to israel a sensitive issue though the chancellor ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens have denied that such a military delivery to israel would conflict with their vocal opposition to any future u.s.-led war against iraq , there are indications that the issue is a delicate one .
the deputy head of the social democrats , michael müller described israel ’ s request as " sensitive " and said that it would land the coalition in a difficult situation .
the request , he said couldn ’ t just be answered with a " simple nod of the head " .
even green party parliamentary leader winfried hermann is concerned that chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer ’ s emphasis that germany will not take part in military action against iraq , could now be interpreted loosely .
he said that the delivery is " part of a whole concept of germany 's indirect participation in a military exchange . "
hermann told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau that the german government should " keep their fingers off it . "
schröder says " no " to u.s. request for fuchs vehicles meanwhile in a news conference on wednesday chancellor schröder also shed more light on the much-speculated wish-list of the united states on german support in a war against iraq .
the chancellor confirmed that germany had agreed to grant flyover rights for u.s. forces and transport troops through germany in the event of military action against iraq .
he also said that washington had asked berlin to specifically provide defense systems against chemical , biological and nuclear attack as well as military police , missile defense systems and financial and material help for possible reconstruction of iraq .
but schröder made it clear that germany would refuse the use of its fuchs armored vehicles stationed in kuwait for any u.s-led military action against iraq . # b # he told reporters it remained " clear as glass " that the german parliament had only allowed a mandate for a twelve-month deployment in the " enduring freedom " action in the war against international terrorism .
" we don ’ t have the intention of moving away from this mandate , " he said .
germany will not be part of a military intervention in iraq , he added .
fuchs for israel but no more the german chancellor also said that germany would also fulfill another israeli request of providing some of its fuchs armored vehicles , which are equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination since there would be use to protect israel ’ s own population .
but schröder ruled out any further military help to israel .
" we do not intend to provide further resources beyond what i have said , and definitely no more personnel , " schröder said .
asked if germany would help rebuild iraq after a war , schröder said , " we expect that there will be no need for a military intervention and that is the german government ’ s political goal , and i think it would be wrong to assume the country will have to be rebuilt . "
schröder ’ s clear statements lay to rest speculation over the mission of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible u.s.-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
schröder criticised for stance on u.s. schröder ’ s permission for u.s. forces to use german airspace and allow them transit rights within germany in the event of war against iraq has led to criticism even within the ruling coalition .
angelika beer , the green party ’ s expert on defense matters questioned the legitimacy of the decision .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
germany ’ s conservative opposition has shown itself to be unsatisfied with chancellor schröder ’ s method of dealing with u.s. requests .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert of the christian democratic party said that the chancellor ’ s explanations were not satisfactory .
the parliamentary chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , wolfgang gerhardt said that schröder ’ s explanations do not end the discussion within the ruling coalition .
there are now fears that schröder ’ s categorical refusal in letting the u.s. use its fuchs vehicles might throw a shadow on already strained u.s.-german relations that were beginning to show signs of improvement of late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government in disarray over iraq there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict .

except in germany a german state 's plan to become the first to allow residents to bury their dead in their backyards is upsetting politicians and preachers alike . it 's the final choice you 'll make - what happens to your mortal remains after death has claimed you .
in germany , however , the living have rather limited choices .
burial or cremation in cemeteries are the only options on offer , with coffins and urns being the recommended and enforced method of internment .
but now , the government in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia wants to relax the rules for its dearly departed .
the plans on the table will allow people to bury their dead in their yards or keep the ashes of loved ones on the mantelpiece .
such things might be common practice in many countries , but in germany such suggestions have angered church authorities and conservative politicians who say changing the rules would be disrespectful to the dead .
but these days , many people believe they should have the choice to decide for themselves .
my bookshelf , my tomb bernd bruns , a craftsman from düsseldorf , does n't want to be buried in a cemetery when he dies .
his preference is to be cremated and have his ashes placed in an urn that will be kept in the home he has shared with his wife for most of his life .
bruns has been fighting for many years for the right to spend eternity looking down from his bookshelf .
" i 'd like to remain at home in the surroundings where i 've spent most of my time .
and i 'm not the only one who 'd like to do that , " bernd said in an interview with dw-tv .
he feels so strongly about the issue that he 's set up a popular web site , which provides tips on how to get around burial red tape and have your last wishes carried out to the letter .
standard practice in holland in the netherlands , widely recognized as the most " pro-choice " nation within europe , the dutch have already been granted more of a choice when it comes to planning that final resting place .
they can bury them in the cemetery , in their garden , at a private mausoleum or cast the cremated ashes to the four winds .
an urn is supplied after cremation only if the deceased had made provision for it in the will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt : not buried in the garden .
but this liberal attitude championed by bernd bruns , his supporters and the dutch is not shared by all .
there are many people who believe the dead have their place in consecrated ground and not in the back garden or house to be found by future unsuspecting generations .
günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says . " they may just think that it 's been sitting there quite a while and hand it over to the public sanitation services where it ends up in the rubbish . "
current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .
germany 's churches state that a coffin is mandatory and that even shrouding the corpse is against burial laws .
the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .
since exhumation is also strictly forbidden under islam and bodies must be buried as soon as possible , 90 percent of germany 's muslims are flown to islamic sites to be buried once they die .
germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .

günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says . " they may just think that it 's been sitting there quite a while and hand it over to the public sanitation services where it ends up in the rubbish . "
current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .
germany 's churches state that a coffin is mandatory and that even shrouding the corpse is against burial laws .
the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .
since exhumation is also strictly forbidden under islam and bodies must be buried as soon as possible , 90 percent of germany 's muslims are flown to islamic sites to be buried once they die .
germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .
" i 'm not concerned that lots of people are going to want to be buried without a coffin , " he told dw-tv .
" but it could help certain ethnic groups such as muslims - and why should n't we make some concessions to people from these religious communities when it does us no harm at all . "
the body should be returned to god , says church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church believes consecrated is best .
" judeo-christian tradition states that the remains of the dead should not be placed under our own control or those affiliated with us but should be returned to the hand of god ... through consecrated ground , " says father schwab of the protestant church in germany rhineland .
a decision date has yet to be set and the debate is likely to rage on even then .
however , after his years of campaigning , bernd bruns feels confident enough to have already bought an urn that he says fits very well in his bookcase . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de final farewell icy winds coursed through the british capital , making the line of people queing on lambeth bridge shiver as the crowd waited solemnly for the queen mother to pass .

but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold . a week after the leader of turkey ’ s new ruling party , tayyip erdogan , met german chancellor gerhard schröder , it ’ s now the turn of turkish president ahmet sezer -lrb- photo -rrb- to pay his regards in berlin and shore up support for his nation ’ s european union bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet necdet sezer turkey is pushing the eu to name a date for starting negotiations on accession to the european union at the copenhagen summit next month .
the visit is especially important for ankara , which sees berlin as a key partner in helping it secure a place in brussels .
germany is home to the largest turkish population in europe -lrb- 2.5 million -rrb- and has maintained close relations with ankara for decades .
german parties split over membership for turkey but despite those advantageous factors , the going will be anything but smooth for president sezer .
recent weeks have seen germany ’ s main political parties sharply divided over whether a muslim state of 66 million people should be permitted into a european union that is largely christian .
while the opposition christian democrats fear that admitting an islamic country would rock the balance in what they see as europe ’ s christian heritage , chancellor schröder ’ s ruling social democrat-green coalition government welcomes the idea and banks on the strategic advantage of future turkish membership .

conservative german politicians argue that the cultural and religious differences between turkey and the european union are insurmountable .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the premier of the state of hessen , said in a television interview recently , " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that ’ s a european tradition .
of course , we can ’ t blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we mustn ’ t ignore that fact . "

" if you define europe as ' christian , ' that would also exclude millions , millions of moslems who are already in the european union , " she said .
" it ’ s the second-biggest religious group within the eu already . "
the social democrats are instead trying to portray turkey as an shining example of a unique muslim state where islam and modernity can go hand in hand .
" we in europe see how turkey proves that islam and democracy can be reconciled in a society where state and religion are seperate .
this is a great hope which we should support because it 's a unique case , " a foreign policy spokesman of the spd said .

but away from the delicate question of european heritage and identity , other factors , too , have germany ’ s political parties worried .
germany ’ s conservative parties fear that turkish membership would open the flood gates to a wave of many more muslim immigrants to join families in german cities .
turkey 's failure to fulfill all criteria for eu membership on issues including its human rights record , the rights of its kurdish minority and the cyprus conflict , also remains a matter of concern for parties across the political spectrum .
anti-turkish rumblings across europe the hard-line stance against turkey among germany 's opposition politicians has been echoed across europe .
the current debate started after valéry giscard d 'estaing , the head of the convent charged with drafting a european constitution , made controversial statements earlier this month . giscard d 'estaing remarked that turkey is not a " european country " and that it 's accession would bring about an " end of the eu .

after days of intense speculation , unconfirmed media reports and a slew of allegations regarding germany ’ s exact role in the case of military action against iraq and military requests from israel , chancellor gerhard schröder has finally spoken out in clear and unambiguous language .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in extracts of a newspaper interview released on tuesday , chancellor schröder confirmed that germany will provide israel with anti-missile systems .
" if the israeli government feels it needs this added security , we will help - and promptly , " schröder told the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" this is our moral and historical obligation ...
the security of the israeli state and its citizens is of utmost importance to us . "
patriot missiles only for defense purposes at the same time the chancellor stressed that the patriot missiles were purely defensive weapons .
" they offer protection against missile attacks .
the security of the state of israel and its citizens is of prime importance to us , " he said .
the social democrat foreign expert , gernot erler defended the government 's plan to deliver missiles to israel .
he said the request from jerusalem had nothing to do with a u.s. request for german support in a war against iraq .
the german defense ministry said israel had long ago expressed interest in acquiring new surplus patriot missiles from germany and had renewed its request a week ago .
the israeli embassy said the request was made a year ago , but that it had taken on a new urgency due to the looming iraq crisis .
israel is preparing for possible retaliation from iraq in the event of u.s. military action against the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs the u.s.-built patriots are designed to intercept and shoot down incoming ballistic missiles and have a limited range .
additionally , the fact that the distance between iraq and israel is small , means that the early warning period is short .
in military circles there is a agreement that every additional defense system improves security according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
in the 1991 gulf war iraq fired 39 scud missiles at israel , though the missiles have been updated since then .
german military supply to israel a sensitive issue though the chancellor ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens have denied that such a military delivery to israel would conflict with their vocal opposition to any future u.s.-led war against iraq , there are indications that the issue is a delicate one .
the deputy head of the social democrats , michael müller described israel ’ s request as " sensitive " and said that it would land the coalition in a difficult situation .
the request , he said couldn ’ t just be answered with a " simple nod of the head " .
even green party parliamentary leader winfried hermann is concerned that chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer ’ s emphasis that germany will not take part in military action against iraq , could now be interpreted loosely .
he said that the delivery is " part of a whole concept of germany 's indirect participation in a military exchange . "
hermann told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau that the german government should " keep their fingers off it . "
schröder says " no " to u.s. request for fuchs vehicles meanwhile in a news conference on wednesday chancellor schröder also shed more light on the much-speculated wish-list of the united states on german support in a war against iraq .
the chancellor confirmed that germany had agreed to grant flyover rights for u.s. forces and transport troops through germany in the event of military action against iraq .
he also said that washington had asked berlin to specifically provide defense systems against chemical , biological and nuclear attack as well as military police , missile defense systems and financial and material help for possible reconstruction of iraq .
but schröder made it clear that germany would refuse the use of its fuchs armored vehicles stationed in kuwait for any u.s-led military action against iraq . # b # he told reporters it remained " clear as glass " that the german parliament had only allowed a mandate for a twelve-month deployment in the " enduring freedom " action in the war against international terrorism .
" we don ’ t have the intention of moving away from this mandate , " he said .
germany will not be part of a military intervention in iraq , he added .
fuchs for israel but no more the german chancellor also said that germany would also fulfill another israeli request of providing some of its fuchs armored vehicles , which are equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination since there would be use to protect israel ’ s own population .
but schröder ruled out any further military help to israel .
" we do not intend to provide further resources beyond what i have said , and definitely no more personnel , " schröder said .
asked if germany would help rebuild iraq after a war , schröder said , " we expect that there will be no need for a military intervention and that is the german government ’ s political goal , and i think it would be wrong to assume the country will have to be rebuilt . "
schröder ’ s clear statements lay to rest speculation over the mission of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible u.s.-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
schröder criticised for stance on u.s. schröder ’ s permission for u.s. forces to use german airspace and allow them transit rights within germany in the event of war against iraq has led to criticism even within the ruling coalition .
angelika beer , the green party ’ s expert on defense matters questioned the legitimacy of the decision .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
germany ’ s conservative opposition has shown itself to be unsatisfied with chancellor schröder ’ s method of dealing with u.s. requests .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert of the christian democratic party said that the chancellor ’ s explanations were not satisfactory .
the parliamentary chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , wolfgang gerhardt said that schröder ’ s explanations do not end the discussion within the ruling coalition .
there are now fears that schröder ’ s categorical refusal in letting the u.s. use its fuchs vehicles might throw a shadow on already strained u.s.-german relations that were beginning to show signs of improvement of late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government in disarray over iraq there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict .

" they offer protection against missile attacks .
the security of the state of israel and its citizens is of prime importance to us , " he said .
the social democrat foreign expert , gernot erler defended the government 's plan to deliver missiles to israel .
he said the request from jerusalem had nothing to do with a u.s. request for german support in a war against iraq .
the german defense ministry said israel had long ago expressed interest in acquiring new surplus patriot missiles from germany and had renewed its request a week ago .
the israeli embassy said the request was made a year ago , but that it had taken on a new urgency due to the looming iraq crisis .
israel is preparing for possible retaliation from iraq in the event of u.s. military action against the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs the u.s.-built patriots are designed to intercept and shoot down incoming ballistic missiles and have a limited range .
additionally , the fact that the distance between iraq and israel is small , means that the early warning period is short .
in military circles there is a agreement that every additional defense system improves security according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
in the 1991 gulf war iraq fired 39 scud missiles at israel , though the missiles have been updated since then .
german military supply to israel a sensitive issue though the chancellor ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens have denied that such a military delivery to israel would conflict with their vocal opposition to any future u.s.-led war against iraq , there are indications that the issue is a delicate one .
the deputy head of the social democrats , michael müller described israel ’ s request as " sensitive " and said that it would land the coalition in a difficult situation .
the request , he said couldn ’ t just be answered with a " simple nod of the head " .
even green party parliamentary leader winfried hermann is concerned that chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer ’ s emphasis that germany will not take part in military action against iraq , could now be interpreted loosely .
he said that the delivery is " part of a whole concept of germany 's indirect participation in a military exchange . "
hermann told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau that the german government should " keep their fingers off it . "
schröder says " no " to u.s. request for fuchs vehicles meanwhile in a news conference on wednesday chancellor schröder also shed more light on the much-speculated wish-list of the united states on german support in a war against iraq .
the chancellor confirmed that germany had agreed to grant flyover rights for u.s. forces and transport troops through germany in the event of military action against iraq .
he also said that washington had asked berlin to specifically provide defense systems against chemical , biological and nuclear attack as well as military police , missile defense systems and financial and material help for possible reconstruction of iraq .
but schröder made it clear that germany would refuse the use of its fuchs armored vehicles stationed in kuwait for any u.s-led military action against iraq . # b # he told reporters it remained " clear as glass " that the german parliament had only allowed a mandate for a twelve-month deployment in the " enduring freedom " action in the war against international terrorism .
" we don ’ t have the intention of moving away from this mandate , " he said .
germany will not be part of a military intervention in iraq , he added .
fuchs for israel but no more the german chancellor also said that germany would also fulfill another israeli request of providing some of its fuchs armored vehicles , which are equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination since there would be use to protect israel ’ s own population .
but schröder ruled out any further military help to israel .
" we do not intend to provide further resources beyond what i have said , and definitely no more personnel , " schröder said .
asked if germany would help rebuild iraq after a war , schröder said , " we expect that there will be no need for a military intervention and that is the german government ’ s political goal , and i think it would be wrong to assume the country will have to be rebuilt . "
schröder ’ s clear statements lay to rest speculation over the mission of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible u.s.-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
schröder criticised for stance on u.s. schröder ’ s permission for u.s. forces to use german airspace and allow them transit rights within germany in the event of war against iraq has led to criticism even within the ruling coalition .
angelika beer , the green party ’ s expert on defense matters questioned the legitimacy of the decision .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
germany ’ s conservative opposition has shown itself to be unsatisfied with chancellor schröder ’ s method of dealing with u.s. requests .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert of the christian democratic party said that the chancellor ’ s explanations were not satisfactory .
the parliamentary chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , wolfgang gerhardt said that schröder ’ s explanations do not end the discussion within the ruling coalition .
there are now fears that schröder ’ s categorical refusal in letting the u.s. use its fuchs vehicles might throw a shadow on already strained u.s.-german relations that were beginning to show signs of improvement of late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government in disarray over iraq there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .
hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .
struck also remained adamant that he would not send more troops to kuwait .
as if to highlight the spd 's internal disarray , struck 's own parliamentary state secretary , hans georg wagner , contradicted his minister , saying that the german troops and tanks would " naturally " be deployed in the event of an attack .
greens warn against involvement while the greens concede the possible use of the troops in kuwait , they remain firmly opposed to any other involvement in a possible war .
winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .
hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .
struck also remained adamant that he would not send more troops to kuwait .
as if to highlight the spd 's internal disarray , struck 's own parliamentary state secretary , hans georg wagner , contradicted his minister , saying that the german troops and tanks would " naturally " be deployed in the event of an attack .
greens warn against involvement while the greens concede the possible use of the troops in kuwait , they remain firmly opposed to any other involvement in a possible war .
winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .
breach of international law ?
meanwhile , angelika beer , the greens ' expert on defense matters , questioned the legitimacy of chancellor gerhard schröder 's stance on allowing washington to use german airspace or u.s bases here in the event of a war .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
political pundits attribute schröder 's victory in september 's general election to his hardline anti-war stance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.11.2002 berlin sends mixed signals on iraq issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel used patriot missiles with limited success in 1991 suspense mounted as chancellor schröder said " yes " to delivery of patriot missiles to israel and flyover rights for u.s. forces in a war against iraq , but turned down a u.s. request for use of german armored vehicles . the fog seems to be gradually lifting on a tricky defense debate that has occupied the german government for weeks and provided ample ammunition to the conservative opposition .
after days of intense speculation , unconfirmed media reports and a slew of allegations regarding germany ’ s exact role in the case of military action against iraq and military requests from israel , chancellor gerhard schröder has finally spoken out in clear and unambiguous language .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in extracts of a newspaper interview released on tuesday , chancellor schröder confirmed that germany will provide israel with anti-missile systems .
" if the israeli government feels it needs this added security , we will help - and promptly , " schröder told the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" this is our moral and historical obligation ...
the security of the israeli state and its citizens is of utmost importance to us . "
patriot missiles only for defense purposes at the same time the chancellor stressed that the patriot missiles were purely defensive weapons .
" they offer protection against missile attacks .
the security of the state of israel and its citizens is of prime importance to us , " he said .
the social democrat foreign expert , gernot erler defended the government 's plan to deliver missiles to israel .
he said the request from jerusalem had nothing to do with a u.s. request for german support in a war against iraq .
the german defense ministry said israel had long ago expressed interest in acquiring new surplus patriot missiles from germany and had renewed its request a week ago .
the israeli embassy said the request was made a year ago , but that it had taken on a new urgency due to the looming iraq crisis .
israel is preparing for possible retaliation from iraq in the event of u.s. military action against the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs the u.s.-built patriots are designed to intercept and shoot down incoming ballistic missiles and have a limited range .
additionally , the fact that the distance between iraq and israel is small , means that the early warning period is short .
in military circles there is a agreement that every additional defense system improves security according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
in the 1991 gulf war iraq fired 39 scud missiles at israel , though the missiles have been updated since then .
german military supply to israel a sensitive issue though the chancellor ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens have denied that such a military delivery to israel would conflict with their vocal opposition to any future u.s.-led war against iraq , there are indications that the issue is a delicate one .
the deputy head of the social democrats , michael müller described israel ’ s request as " sensitive " and said that it would land the coalition in a difficult situation .
the request , he said couldn ’ t just be answered with a " simple nod of the head " .
even green party parliamentary leader winfried hermann is concerned that chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer ’ s emphasis that germany will not take part in military action against iraq , could now be interpreted loosely .
he said that the delivery is " part of a whole concept of germany 's indirect participation in a military exchange . "
hermann told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau that the german government should " keep their fingers off it . "
schröder says " no " to u.s. request for fuchs vehicles meanwhile in a news conference on wednesday chancellor schröder also shed more light on the much-speculated wish-list of the united states on german support in a war against iraq .
the chancellor confirmed that germany had agreed to grant flyover rights for u.s. forces and transport troops through germany in the event of military action against iraq .
he also said that washington had asked berlin to specifically provide defense systems against chemical , biological and nuclear attack as well as military police , missile defense systems and financial and material help for possible reconstruction of iraq .
but schröder made it clear that germany would refuse the use of its fuchs armored vehicles stationed in kuwait for any u.s-led military action against iraq . # b # he told reporters it remained " clear as glass " that the german parliament had only allowed a mandate for a twelve-month deployment in the " enduring freedom " action in the war against international terrorism .
" we don ’ t have the intention of moving away from this mandate , " he said .
germany will not be part of a military intervention in iraq , he added .
fuchs for israel but no more the german chancellor also said that germany would also fulfill another israeli request of providing some of its fuchs armored vehicles , which are equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination since there would be use to protect israel ’ s own population .
but schröder ruled out any further military help to israel .
" we do not intend to provide further resources beyond what i have said , and definitely no more personnel , " schröder said .
asked if germany would help rebuild iraq after a war , schröder said , " we expect that there will be no need for a military intervention and that is the german government ’ s political goal , and i think it would be wrong to assume the country will have to be rebuilt . "
schröder ’ s clear statements lay to rest speculation over the mission of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible u.s.-led war on iraq .

after days of intense speculation , unconfirmed media reports and a slew of allegations regarding germany ’ s exact role in the case of military action against iraq and military requests from israel , chancellor gerhard schröder has finally spoken out in clear and unambiguous language .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in extracts of a newspaper interview released on tuesday , chancellor schröder confirmed that germany will provide israel with anti-missile systems .
" if the israeli government feels it needs this added security , we will help - and promptly , " schröder told the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" this is our moral and historical obligation ...
the security of the israeli state and its citizens is of utmost importance to us . "
patriot missiles only for defense purposes at the same time the chancellor stressed that the patriot missiles were purely defensive weapons .
" they offer protection against missile attacks .
the security of the state of israel and its citizens is of prime importance to us , " he said .
the social democrat foreign expert , gernot erler defended the government 's plan to deliver missiles to israel .
he said the request from jerusalem had nothing to do with a u.s. request for german support in a war against iraq .
the german defense ministry said israel had long ago expressed interest in acquiring new surplus patriot missiles from germany and had renewed its request a week ago .
the israeli embassy said the request was made a year ago , but that it had taken on a new urgency due to the looming iraq crisis .
israel is preparing for possible retaliation from iraq in the event of u.s. military action against the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs the u.s.-built patriots are designed to intercept and shoot down incoming ballistic missiles and have a limited range .
additionally , the fact that the distance between iraq and israel is small , means that the early warning period is short .
in military circles there is a agreement that every additional defense system improves security according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
in the 1991 gulf war iraq fired 39 scud missiles at israel , though the missiles have been updated since then .
german military supply to israel a sensitive issue though the chancellor ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens have denied that such a military delivery to israel would conflict with their vocal opposition to any future u.s.-led war against iraq , there are indications that the issue is a delicate one .
the deputy head of the social democrats , michael müller described israel ’ s request as " sensitive " and said that it would land the coalition in a difficult situation .
the request , he said couldn ’ t just be answered with a " simple nod of the head " .
even green party parliamentary leader winfried hermann is concerned that chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer ’ s emphasis that germany will not take part in military action against iraq , could now be interpreted loosely .
he said that the delivery is " part of a whole concept of germany 's indirect participation in a military exchange . "
hermann told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau that the german government should " keep their fingers off it . "
schröder says " no " to u.s. request for fuchs vehicles meanwhile in a news conference on wednesday chancellor schröder also shed more light on the much-speculated wish-list of the united states on german support in a war against iraq .
the chancellor confirmed that germany had agreed to grant flyover rights for u.s. forces and transport troops through germany in the event of military action against iraq .
he also said that washington had asked berlin to specifically provide defense systems against chemical , biological and nuclear attack as well as military police , missile defense systems and financial and material help for possible reconstruction of iraq .
but schröder made it clear that germany would refuse the use of its fuchs armored vehicles stationed in kuwait for any u.s-led military action against iraq . # b # he told reporters it remained " clear as glass " that the german parliament had only allowed a mandate for a twelve-month deployment in the " enduring freedom " action in the war against international terrorism .
" we don ’ t have the intention of moving away from this mandate , " he said .
germany will not be part of a military intervention in iraq , he added .
fuchs for israel but no more the german chancellor also said that germany would also fulfill another israeli request of providing some of its fuchs armored vehicles , which are equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination since there would be use to protect israel ’ s own population .
but schröder ruled out any further military help to israel .
" we do not intend to provide further resources beyond what i have said , and definitely no more personnel , " schröder said .
asked if germany would help rebuild iraq after a war , schröder said , " we expect that there will be no need for a military intervention and that is the german government ’ s political goal , and i think it would be wrong to assume the country will have to be rebuilt . "
schröder ’ s clear statements lay to rest speculation over the mission of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible u.s.-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
schröder criticised for stance on u.s. schröder ’ s permission for u.s. forces to use german airspace and allow them transit rights within germany in the event of war against iraq has led to criticism even within the ruling coalition .

except in germany a german state 's plan to become the first to allow residents to bury their dead in their backyards is upsetting politicians and preachers alike . it 's the final choice you 'll make - what happens to your mortal remains after death has claimed you .
in germany , however , the living have rather limited choices .
burial or cremation in cemeteries are the only options on offer , with coffins and urns being the recommended and enforced method of internment .
but now , the government in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia wants to relax the rules for its dearly departed .
the plans on the table will allow people to bury their dead in their yards or keep the ashes of loved ones on the mantelpiece .
such things might be common practice in many countries , but in germany such suggestions have angered church authorities and conservative politicians who say changing the rules would be disrespectful to the dead .
but these days , many people believe they should have the choice to decide for themselves .
my bookshelf , my tomb bernd bruns , a craftsman from düsseldorf , does n't want to be buried in a cemetery when he dies .
his preference is to be cremated and have his ashes placed in an urn that will be kept in the home he has shared with his wife for most of his life .
bruns has been fighting for many years for the right to spend eternity looking down from his bookshelf .
" i 'd like to remain at home in the surroundings where i 've spent most of my time .
and i 'm not the only one who 'd like to do that , " bernd said in an interview with dw-tv .
he feels so strongly about the issue that he 's set up a popular web site , which provides tips on how to get around burial red tape and have your last wishes carried out to the letter .
standard practice in holland in the netherlands , widely recognized as the most " pro-choice " nation within europe , the dutch have already been granted more of a choice when it comes to planning that final resting place .
they can bury them in the cemetery , in their garden , at a private mausoleum or cast the cremated ashes to the four winds .
an urn is supplied after cremation only if the deceased had made provision for it in the will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt : not buried in the garden .
but this liberal attitude championed by bernd bruns , his supporters and the dutch is not shared by all .
there are many people who believe the dead have their place in consecrated ground and not in the back garden or house to be found by future unsuspecting generations .
günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says . " they may just think that it 's been sitting there quite a while and hand it over to the public sanitation services where it ends up in the rubbish . "
current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .
germany 's churches state that a coffin is mandatory and that even shrouding the corpse is against burial laws .
the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .
since exhumation is also strictly forbidden under islam and bodies must be buried as soon as possible , 90 percent of germany 's muslims are flown to islamic sites to be buried once they die .
germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .
" i 'm not concerned that lots of people are going to want to be buried without a coffin , " he told dw-tv .

except in germany a german state 's plan to become the first to allow residents to bury their dead in their backyards is upsetting politicians and preachers alike . it 's the final choice you 'll make - what happens to your mortal remains after death has claimed you .
in germany , however , the living have rather limited choices .
burial or cremation in cemeteries are the only options on offer , with coffins and urns being the recommended and enforced method of internment .
but now , the government in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia wants to relax the rules for its dearly departed .
the plans on the table will allow people to bury their dead in their yards or keep the ashes of loved ones on the mantelpiece .
such things might be common practice in many countries , but in germany such suggestions have angered church authorities and conservative politicians who say changing the rules would be disrespectful to the dead .
but these days , many people believe they should have the choice to decide for themselves .
my bookshelf , my tomb bernd bruns , a craftsman from düsseldorf , does n't want to be buried in a cemetery when he dies .
his preference is to be cremated and have his ashes placed in an urn that will be kept in the home he has shared with his wife for most of his life .
bruns has been fighting for many years for the right to spend eternity looking down from his bookshelf .
" i 'd like to remain at home in the surroundings where i 've spent most of my time .
and i 'm not the only one who 'd like to do that , " bernd said in an interview with dw-tv .
he feels so strongly about the issue that he 's set up a popular web site , which provides tips on how to get around burial red tape and have your last wishes carried out to the letter .
standard practice in holland in the netherlands , widely recognized as the most " pro-choice " nation within europe , the dutch have already been granted more of a choice when it comes to planning that final resting place .
they can bury them in the cemetery , in their garden , at a private mausoleum or cast the cremated ashes to the four winds .
an urn is supplied after cremation only if the deceased had made provision for it in the will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt : not buried in the garden .
but this liberal attitude championed by bernd bruns , his supporters and the dutch is not shared by all .
there are many people who believe the dead have their place in consecrated ground and not in the back garden or house to be found by future unsuspecting generations .
günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says . " they may just think that it 's been sitting there quite a while and hand it over to the public sanitation services where it ends up in the rubbish . "
current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .
germany 's churches state that a coffin is mandatory and that even shrouding the corpse is against burial laws .
the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .
since exhumation is also strictly forbidden under islam and bodies must be buried as soon as possible , 90 percent of germany 's muslims are flown to islamic sites to be buried once they die .
germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .
" i 'm not concerned that lots of people are going to want to be buried without a coffin , " he told dw-tv .
" but it could help certain ethnic groups such as muslims - and why should n't we make some concessions to people from these religious communities when it does us no harm at all . "
the body should be returned to god , says church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church believes consecrated is best .
" judeo-christian tradition states that the remains of the dead should not be placed under our own control or those affiliated with us but should be returned to the hand of god ... through consecrated ground , " says father schwab of the protestant church in germany rhineland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.11.2002 germany still wary of turkey 's eu aspirations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : its large turkish population makes germany 's position on turkey 's eu membership a difficult one turkish president ahmet sezer is in berlin to rally support for eu membership .
but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold . a week after the leader of turkey ’ s new ruling party , tayyip erdogan , met german chancellor gerhard schröder , it ’ s now the turn of turkish president ahmet sezer -lrb- photo -rrb- to pay his regards in berlin and shore up support for his nation ’ s european union bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet necdet sezer turkey is pushing the eu to name a date for starting negotiations on accession to the european union at the copenhagen summit next month .
the visit is especially important for ankara , which sees berlin as a key partner in helping it secure a place in brussels .
germany is home to the largest turkish population in europe -lrb- 2.5 million -rrb- and has maintained close relations with ankara for decades .
german parties split over membership for turkey but despite those advantageous factors , the going will be anything but smooth for president sezer .
recent weeks have seen germany ’ s main political parties sharply divided over whether a muslim state of 66 million people should be permitted into a european union that is largely christian .
while the opposition christian democrats fear that admitting an islamic country would rock the balance in what they see as europe ’ s christian heritage , chancellor schröder ’ s ruling social democrat-green coalition government welcomes the idea and banks on the strategic advantage of future turkish membership .
conservatives see turkey as " too different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber speaking on friday before a christian social union party congress , former conservative chancellor candidate edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " europe is a community that is based on western values .
as a community of shared values , europe has to deal with the question of its borders .
these borders must be based on shared values , culture and history .
turkey ’ s membership would breach these borders . "
conservative german politicians argue that the cultural and religious differences between turkey and the european union are insurmountable .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the premier of the state of hessen , said in a television interview recently , " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that ’ s a european tradition .
of course , we can ’ t blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we mustn ’ t ignore that fact . "
greens and spd say turkey is " unique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth claudia roth -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the ruling green party thinks that such an argument is " dangerous " .
" if you define europe as ' christian , ' that would also exclude millions , millions of moslems who are already in the european union , " she said .
" it ’ s the second-biggest religious group within the eu already . "
the social democrats are instead trying to portray turkey as an shining example of a unique muslim state where islam and modernity can go hand in hand .
" we in europe see how turkey proves that islam and democracy can be reconciled in a society where state and religion are seperate .
this is a great hope which we should support because it 's a unique case , " a foreign policy spokesman of the spd said .
more problems for germany with turkish accession ?
but away from the delicate question of european heritage and identity , other factors , too , have germany ’ s political parties worried .
germany ’ s conservative parties fear that turkish membership would open the flood gates to a wave of many more muslim immigrants to join families in german cities .
turkey 's failure to fulfill all criteria for eu membership on issues including its human rights record , the rights of its kurdish minority and the cyprus conflict , also remains a matter of concern for parties across the political spectrum .
anti-turkish rumblings across europe the hard-line stance against turkey among germany 's opposition politicians has been echoed across europe .
the current debate started after valéry giscard d 'estaing , the head of the convent charged with drafting a european constitution , made controversial statements earlier this month . giscard d 'estaing remarked that turkey is not a " european country " and that it 's accession would bring about an " end of the eu . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish leader rallies berlin 's support for eu negotiations recep tayyip erdogan is on a whirlwind tour of european capitals to build support for future turkish eu membership .
but even strong u.s. support is no guarantee of a concrete commitment from brussels .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .
hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .
struck also remained adamant that he would not send more troops to kuwait .
as if to highlight the spd 's internal disarray , struck 's own parliamentary state secretary , hans georg wagner , contradicted his minister , saying that the german troops and tanks would " naturally " be deployed in the event of an attack .
greens warn against involvement while the greens concede the possible use of the troops in kuwait , they remain firmly opposed to any other involvement in a possible war .
winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .
breach of international law ?
meanwhile , angelika beer , the greens ' expert on defense matters , questioned the legitimacy of chancellor gerhard schröder 's stance on allowing washington to use german airspace or u.s bases here in the event of a war .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
political pundits attribute schröder 's victory in september 's general election to his hardline anti-war stance .

except in germany a german state 's plan to become the first to allow residents to bury their dead in their backyards is upsetting politicians and preachers alike . it 's the final choice you 'll make - what happens to your mortal remains after death has claimed you .
in germany , however , the living have rather limited choices .
burial or cremation in cemeteries are the only options on offer , with coffins and urns being the recommended and enforced method of internment .
but now , the government in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia wants to relax the rules for its dearly departed .
the plans on the table will allow people to bury their dead in their yards or keep the ashes of loved ones on the mantelpiece .
such things might be common practice in many countries , but in germany such suggestions have angered church authorities and conservative politicians who say changing the rules would be disrespectful to the dead .
but these days , many people believe they should have the choice to decide for themselves .
my bookshelf , my tomb bernd bruns , a craftsman from düsseldorf , does n't want to be buried in a cemetery when he dies .
his preference is to be cremated and have his ashes placed in an urn that will be kept in the home he has shared with his wife for most of his life .
bruns has been fighting for many years for the right to spend eternity looking down from his bookshelf .
" i 'd like to remain at home in the surroundings where i 've spent most of my time .
and i 'm not the only one who 'd like to do that , " bernd said in an interview with dw-tv .
he feels so strongly about the issue that he 's set up a popular web site , which provides tips on how to get around burial red tape and have your last wishes carried out to the letter .
standard practice in holland in the netherlands , widely recognized as the most " pro-choice " nation within europe , the dutch have already been granted more of a choice when it comes to planning that final resting place .
they can bury them in the cemetery , in their garden , at a private mausoleum or cast the cremated ashes to the four winds .
an urn is supplied after cremation only if the deceased had made provision for it in the will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt : not buried in the garden .
but this liberal attitude championed by bernd bruns , his supporters and the dutch is not shared by all .
there are many people who believe the dead have their place in consecrated ground and not in the back garden or house to be found by future unsuspecting generations .
günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says . " they may just think that it 's been sitting there quite a while and hand it over to the public sanitation services where it ends up in the rubbish . "
current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .
germany 's churches state that a coffin is mandatory and that even shrouding the corpse is against burial laws .
the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .
since exhumation is also strictly forbidden under islam and bodies must be buried as soon as possible , 90 percent of germany 's muslims are flown to islamic sites to be buried once they die .
germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .
" i 'm not concerned that lots of people are going to want to be buried without a coffin , " he told dw-tv .
" but it could help certain ethnic groups such as muslims - and why should n't we make some concessions to people from these religious communities when it does us no harm at all . "
the body should be returned to god , says church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church believes consecrated is best .
" judeo-christian tradition states that the remains of the dead should not be placed under our own control or those affiliated with us but should be returned to the hand of god ... through consecrated ground , " says father schwab of the protestant church in germany rhineland .
a decision date has yet to be set and the debate is likely to rage on even then .
however , after his years of campaigning , bernd bruns feels confident enough to have already bought an urn that he says fits very well in his bookcase . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de final farewell icy winds coursed through the british capital , making the line of people queing on lambeth bridge shiver as the crowd waited solemnly for the queen mother to pass .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.11.2002 german government in disarray over iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's defense minister peter struck -lrb- right -rrb- may not have much to laugh about if an iraqi war becomes reality .
there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .
hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .
struck also remained adamant that he would not send more troops to kuwait .
as if to highlight the spd 's internal disarray , struck 's own parliamentary state secretary , hans georg wagner , contradicted his minister , saying that the german troops and tanks would " naturally " be deployed in the event of an attack .
greens warn against involvement while the greens concede the possible use of the troops in kuwait , they remain firmly opposed to any other involvement in a possible war .
winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .
hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .
struck also remained adamant that he would not send more troops to kuwait .
as if to highlight the spd 's internal disarray , struck 's own parliamentary state secretary , hans georg wagner , contradicted his minister , saying that the german troops and tanks would " naturally " be deployed in the event of an attack .
greens warn against involvement while the greens concede the possible use of the troops in kuwait , they remain firmly opposed to any other involvement in a possible war .
winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .

except in germany a german state 's plan to become the first to allow residents to bury their dead in their backyards is upsetting politicians and preachers alike . it 's the final choice you 'll make - what happens to your mortal remains after death has claimed you .
in germany , however , the living have rather limited choices .
burial or cremation in cemeteries are the only options on offer , with coffins and urns being the recommended and enforced method of internment .
but now , the government in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia wants to relax the rules for its dearly departed .
the plans on the table will allow people to bury their dead in their yards or keep the ashes of loved ones on the mantelpiece .
such things might be common practice in many countries , but in germany such suggestions have angered church authorities and conservative politicians who say changing the rules would be disrespectful to the dead .
but these days , many people believe they should have the choice to decide for themselves .
my bookshelf , my tomb bernd bruns , a craftsman from düsseldorf , does n't want to be buried in a cemetery when he dies .
his preference is to be cremated and have his ashes placed in an urn that will be kept in the home he has shared with his wife for most of his life .
bruns has been fighting for many years for the right to spend eternity looking down from his bookshelf .
" i 'd like to remain at home in the surroundings where i 've spent most of my time .
and i 'm not the only one who 'd like to do that , " bernd said in an interview with dw-tv .
he feels so strongly about the issue that he 's set up a popular web site , which provides tips on how to get around burial red tape and have your last wishes carried out to the letter .
standard practice in holland in the netherlands , widely recognized as the most " pro-choice " nation within europe , the dutch have already been granted more of a choice when it comes to planning that final resting place .
they can bury them in the cemetery , in their garden , at a private mausoleum or cast the cremated ashes to the four winds .
an urn is supplied after cremation only if the deceased had made provision for it in the will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt : not buried in the garden .
but this liberal attitude championed by bernd bruns , his supporters and the dutch is not shared by all .
there are many people who believe the dead have their place in consecrated ground and not in the back garden or house to be found by future unsuspecting generations .
günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says . " they may just think that it 's been sitting there quite a while and hand it over to the public sanitation services where it ends up in the rubbish . "
current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .
germany 's churches state that a coffin is mandatory and that even shrouding the corpse is against burial laws .
the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .
since exhumation is also strictly forbidden under islam and bodies must be buried as soon as possible , 90 percent of germany 's muslims are flown to islamic sites to be buried once they die .
germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .
" i 'm not concerned that lots of people are going to want to be buried without a coffin , " he told dw-tv .
" but it could help certain ethnic groups such as muslims - and why should n't we make some concessions to people from these religious communities when it does us no harm at all . "
the body should be returned to god , says church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church believes consecrated is best .
" judeo-christian tradition states that the remains of the dead should not be placed under our own control or those affiliated with us but should be returned to the hand of god ... through consecrated ground , " says father schwab of the protestant church in germany rhineland .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .

hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .

" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .
breach of international law ?
meanwhile , angelika beer , the greens ' expert on defense matters , questioned the legitimacy of chancellor gerhard schröder 's stance on allowing washington to use german airspace or u.s bases here in the event of a war .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .

after days of intense speculation , unconfirmed media reports and a slew of allegations regarding germany ’ s exact role in the case of military action against iraq and military requests from israel , chancellor gerhard schröder has finally spoken out in clear and unambiguous language .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in extracts of a newspaper interview released on tuesday , chancellor schröder confirmed that germany will provide israel with anti-missile systems .
" if the israeli government feels it needs this added security , we will help - and promptly , " schröder told the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" this is our moral and historical obligation ...
the security of the israeli state and its citizens is of utmost importance to us . "
patriot missiles only for defense purposes at the same time the chancellor stressed that the patriot missiles were purely defensive weapons .
" they offer protection against missile attacks .
the security of the state of israel and its citizens is of prime importance to us , " he said .
the social democrat foreign expert , gernot erler defended the government 's plan to deliver missiles to israel .
he said the request from jerusalem had nothing to do with a u.s. request for german support in a war against iraq .
the german defense ministry said israel had long ago expressed interest in acquiring new surplus patriot missiles from germany and had renewed its request a week ago .
the israeli embassy said the request was made a year ago , but that it had taken on a new urgency due to the looming iraq crisis .
israel is preparing for possible retaliation from iraq in the event of u.s. military action against the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs the u.s.-built patriots are designed to intercept and shoot down incoming ballistic missiles and have a limited range .
additionally , the fact that the distance between iraq and israel is small , means that the early warning period is short .
in military circles there is a agreement that every additional defense system improves security according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
in the 1991 gulf war iraq fired 39 scud missiles at israel , though the missiles have been updated since then .
german military supply to israel a sensitive issue though the chancellor ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens have denied that such a military delivery to israel would conflict with their vocal opposition to any future u.s.-led war against iraq , there are indications that the issue is a delicate one .
the deputy head of the social democrats , michael müller described israel ’ s request as " sensitive " and said that it would land the coalition in a difficult situation .
the request , he said couldn ’ t just be answered with a " simple nod of the head " .
even green party parliamentary leader winfried hermann is concerned that chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer ’ s emphasis that germany will not take part in military action against iraq , could now be interpreted loosely .
he said that the delivery is " part of a whole concept of germany 's indirect participation in a military exchange . "
hermann told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau that the german government should " keep their fingers off it . "
schröder says " no " to u.s. request for fuchs vehicles meanwhile in a news conference on wednesday chancellor schröder also shed more light on the much-speculated wish-list of the united states on german support in a war against iraq .
the chancellor confirmed that germany had agreed to grant flyover rights for u.s. forces and transport troops through germany in the event of military action against iraq .
he also said that washington had asked berlin to specifically provide defense systems against chemical , biological and nuclear attack as well as military police , missile defense systems and financial and material help for possible reconstruction of iraq .
but schröder made it clear that germany would refuse the use of its fuchs armored vehicles stationed in kuwait for any u.s-led military action against iraq . # b # he told reporters it remained " clear as glass " that the german parliament had only allowed a mandate for a twelve-month deployment in the " enduring freedom " action in the war against international terrorism .
" we don ’ t have the intention of moving away from this mandate , " he said .
germany will not be part of a military intervention in iraq , he added .
fuchs for israel but no more the german chancellor also said that germany would also fulfill another israeli request of providing some of its fuchs armored vehicles , which are equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination since there would be use to protect israel ’ s own population .
but schröder ruled out any further military help to israel .
" we do not intend to provide further resources beyond what i have said , and definitely no more personnel , " schröder said .
asked if germany would help rebuild iraq after a war , schröder said , " we expect that there will be no need for a military intervention and that is the german government ’ s political goal , and i think it would be wrong to assume the country will have to be rebuilt . "
schröder ’ s clear statements lay to rest speculation over the mission of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible u.s.-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
schröder criticised for stance on u.s. schröder ’ s permission for u.s. forces to use german airspace and allow them transit rights within germany in the event of war against iraq has led to criticism even within the ruling coalition .
angelika beer , the green party ’ s expert on defense matters questioned the legitimacy of the decision .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
germany ’ s conservative opposition has shown itself to be unsatisfied with chancellor schröder ’ s method of dealing with u.s. requests .

the parliamentary chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , wolfgang gerhardt said that schröder ’ s explanations do not end the discussion within the ruling coalition .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .

except in germany a german state 's plan to become the first to allow residents to bury their dead in their backyards is upsetting politicians and preachers alike . it 's the final choice you 'll make - what happens to your mortal remains after death has claimed you .
in germany , however , the living have rather limited choices .
burial or cremation in cemeteries are the only options on offer , with coffins and urns being the recommended and enforced method of internment .
but now , the government in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia wants to relax the rules for its dearly departed .
the plans on the table will allow people to bury their dead in their yards or keep the ashes of loved ones on the mantelpiece .
such things might be common practice in many countries , but in germany such suggestions have angered church authorities and conservative politicians who say changing the rules would be disrespectful to the dead .
but these days , many people believe they should have the choice to decide for themselves .
my bookshelf , my tomb bernd bruns , a craftsman from düsseldorf , does n't want to be buried in a cemetery when he dies .
his preference is to be cremated and have his ashes placed in an urn that will be kept in the home he has shared with his wife for most of his life .
bruns has been fighting for many years for the right to spend eternity looking down from his bookshelf .
" i 'd like to remain at home in the surroundings where i 've spent most of my time .
and i 'm not the only one who 'd like to do that , " bernd said in an interview with dw-tv .
he feels so strongly about the issue that he 's set up a popular web site , which provides tips on how to get around burial red tape and have your last wishes carried out to the letter .
standard practice in holland in the netherlands , widely recognized as the most " pro-choice " nation within europe , the dutch have already been granted more of a choice when it comes to planning that final resting place .
they can bury them in the cemetery , in their garden , at a private mausoleum or cast the cremated ashes to the four winds .
an urn is supplied after cremation only if the deceased had made provision for it in the will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt : not buried in the garden .
but this liberal attitude championed by bernd bruns , his supporters and the dutch is not shared by all .
there are many people who believe the dead have their place in consecrated ground and not in the back garden or house to be found by future unsuspecting generations .
günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says . " they may just think that it 's been sitting there quite a while and hand it over to the public sanitation services where it ends up in the rubbish . "
current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .
germany 's churches state that a coffin is mandatory and that even shrouding the corpse is against burial laws .
the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .
since exhumation is also strictly forbidden under islam and bodies must be buried as soon as possible , 90 percent of germany 's muslims are flown to islamic sites to be buried once they die .
germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .
" i 'm not concerned that lots of people are going to want to be buried without a coffin , " he told dw-tv .
" but it could help certain ethnic groups such as muslims - and why should n't we make some concessions to people from these religious communities when it does us no harm at all . "
the body should be returned to god , says church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church believes consecrated is best .
" judeo-christian tradition states that the remains of the dead should not be placed under our own control or those affiliated with us but should be returned to the hand of god ... through consecrated ground , " says father schwab of the protestant church in germany rhineland .
a decision date has yet to be set and the debate is likely to rage on even then .
however , after his years of campaigning , bernd bruns feels confident enough to have already bought an urn that he says fits very well in his bookcase . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de final farewell icy winds coursed through the british capital , making the line of people queing on lambeth bridge shiver as the crowd waited solemnly for the queen mother to pass .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.11.2002 berlin sends mixed signals on iraq issue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel used patriot missiles with limited success in 1991 suspense mounted as chancellor schröder said " yes " to delivery of patriot missiles to israel and flyover rights for u.s. forces in a war against iraq , but turned down a u.s. request for use of german armored vehicles . the fog seems to be gradually lifting on a tricky defense debate that has occupied the german government for weeks and provided ample ammunition to the conservative opposition .
after days of intense speculation , unconfirmed media reports and a slew of allegations regarding germany ’ s exact role in the case of military action against iraq and military requests from israel , chancellor gerhard schröder has finally spoken out in clear and unambiguous language .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in extracts of a newspaper interview released on tuesday , chancellor schröder confirmed that germany will provide israel with anti-missile systems .
" if the israeli government feels it needs this added security , we will help - and promptly , " schröder told the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" this is our moral and historical obligation ...
the security of the israeli state and its citizens is of utmost importance to us . "
patriot missiles only for defense purposes at the same time the chancellor stressed that the patriot missiles were purely defensive weapons .
" they offer protection against missile attacks .
the security of the state of israel and its citizens is of prime importance to us , " he said .
the social democrat foreign expert , gernot erler defended the government 's plan to deliver missiles to israel .
he said the request from jerusalem had nothing to do with a u.s. request for german support in a war against iraq .
the german defense ministry said israel had long ago expressed interest in acquiring new surplus patriot missiles from germany and had renewed its request a week ago .
the israeli embassy said the request was made a year ago , but that it had taken on a new urgency due to the looming iraq crisis .
israel is preparing for possible retaliation from iraq in the event of u.s. military action against the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs the u.s.-built patriots are designed to intercept and shoot down incoming ballistic missiles and have a limited range .
additionally , the fact that the distance between iraq and israel is small , means that the early warning period is short .
in military circles there is a agreement that every additional defense system improves security according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
in the 1991 gulf war iraq fired 39 scud missiles at israel , though the missiles have been updated since then .
german military supply to israel a sensitive issue though the chancellor ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens have denied that such a military delivery to israel would conflict with their vocal opposition to any future u.s.-led war against iraq , there are indications that the issue is a delicate one .
the deputy head of the social democrats , michael müller described israel ’ s request as " sensitive " and said that it would land the coalition in a difficult situation .
the request , he said couldn ’ t just be answered with a " simple nod of the head " .
even green party parliamentary leader winfried hermann is concerned that chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer ’ s emphasis that germany will not take part in military action against iraq , could now be interpreted loosely .
he said that the delivery is " part of a whole concept of germany 's indirect participation in a military exchange . "
hermann told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau that the german government should " keep their fingers off it . "
schröder says " no " to u.s. request for fuchs vehicles meanwhile in a news conference on wednesday chancellor schröder also shed more light on the much-speculated wish-list of the united states on german support in a war against iraq .
the chancellor confirmed that germany had agreed to grant flyover rights for u.s. forces and transport troops through germany in the event of military action against iraq .
he also said that washington had asked berlin to specifically provide defense systems against chemical , biological and nuclear attack as well as military police , missile defense systems and financial and material help for possible reconstruction of iraq .
but schröder made it clear that germany would refuse the use of its fuchs armored vehicles stationed in kuwait for any u.s-led military action against iraq . # b # he told reporters it remained " clear as glass " that the german parliament had only allowed a mandate for a twelve-month deployment in the " enduring freedom " action in the war against international terrorism .
" we don ’ t have the intention of moving away from this mandate , " he said .
germany will not be part of a military intervention in iraq , he added .
fuchs for israel but no more the german chancellor also said that germany would also fulfill another israeli request of providing some of its fuchs armored vehicles , which are equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination since there would be use to protect israel ’ s own population .
but schröder ruled out any further military help to israel .

but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold . a week after the leader of turkey ’ s new ruling party , tayyip erdogan , met german chancellor gerhard schröder , it ’ s now the turn of turkish president ahmet sezer -lrb- photo -rrb- to pay his regards in berlin and shore up support for his nation ’ s european union bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet necdet sezer turkey is pushing the eu to name a date for starting negotiations on accession to the european union at the copenhagen summit next month .
the visit is especially important for ankara , which sees berlin as a key partner in helping it secure a place in brussels .
germany is home to the largest turkish population in europe -lrb- 2.5 million -rrb- and has maintained close relations with ankara for decades .
german parties split over membership for turkey but despite those advantageous factors , the going will be anything but smooth for president sezer .
recent weeks have seen germany ’ s main political parties sharply divided over whether a muslim state of 66 million people should be permitted into a european union that is largely christian .
while the opposition christian democrats fear that admitting an islamic country would rock the balance in what they see as europe ’ s christian heritage , chancellor schröder ’ s ruling social democrat-green coalition government welcomes the idea and banks on the strategic advantage of future turkish membership .
conservatives see turkey as " too different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber speaking on friday before a christian social union party congress , former conservative chancellor candidate edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " europe is a community that is based on western values .

these borders must be based on shared values , culture and history .
turkey ’ s membership would breach these borders . "
conservative german politicians argue that the cultural and religious differences between turkey and the european union are insurmountable .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the premier of the state of hessen , said in a television interview recently , " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that ’ s a european tradition .
of course , we can ’ t blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we mustn ’ t ignore that fact . "
greens and spd say turkey is " unique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth claudia roth -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the ruling green party thinks that such an argument is " dangerous " .
" if you define europe as ' christian , ' that would also exclude millions , millions of moslems who are already in the european union , " she said .
" it ’ s the second-biggest religious group within the eu already . "
the social democrats are instead trying to portray turkey as an shining example of a unique muslim state where islam and modernity can go hand in hand .
" we in europe see how turkey proves that islam and democracy can be reconciled in a society where state and religion are seperate .
this is a great hope which we should support because it 's a unique case , " a foreign policy spokesman of the spd said .
more problems for germany with turkish accession ?
but away from the delicate question of european heritage and identity , other factors , too , have germany ’ s political parties worried .
germany ’ s conservative parties fear that turkish membership would open the flood gates to a wave of many more muslim immigrants to join families in german cities .

while the opposition christian democrats fear that admitting an islamic country would rock the balance in what they see as europe ’ s christian heritage , chancellor schröder ’ s ruling social democrat-green coalition government welcomes the idea and banks on the strategic advantage of future turkish membership .
conservatives see turkey as " too different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber speaking on friday before a christian social union party congress , former conservative chancellor candidate edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " europe is a community that is based on western values .
as a community of shared values , europe has to deal with the question of its borders .
these borders must be based on shared values , culture and history .
turkey ’ s membership would breach these borders . "
conservative german politicians argue that the cultural and religious differences between turkey and the european union are insurmountable .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the premier of the state of hessen , said in a television interview recently , " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that ’ s a european tradition .
of course , we can ’ t blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we mustn ’ t ignore that fact . "
greens and spd say turkey is " unique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth claudia roth -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the ruling green party thinks that such an argument is " dangerous " .
" if you define europe as ' christian , ' that would also exclude millions , millions of moslems who are already in the european union , " she said .
" it ’ s the second-biggest religious group within the eu already . "
the social democrats are instead trying to portray turkey as an shining example of a unique muslim state where islam and modernity can go hand in hand .
" we in europe see how turkey proves that islam and democracy can be reconciled in a society where state and religion are seperate .
this is a great hope which we should support because it 's a unique case , " a foreign policy spokesman of the spd said .
more problems for germany with turkish accession ?
but away from the delicate question of european heritage and identity , other factors , too , have germany ’ s political parties worried .
germany ’ s conservative parties fear that turkish membership would open the flood gates to a wave of many more muslim immigrants to join families in german cities .
turkey 's failure to fulfill all criteria for eu membership on issues including its human rights record , the rights of its kurdish minority and the cyprus conflict , also remains a matter of concern for parties across the political spectrum .
anti-turkish rumblings across europe the hard-line stance against turkey among germany 's opposition politicians has been echoed across europe .
the current debate started after valéry giscard d 'estaing , the head of the convent charged with drafting a european constitution , made controversial statements earlier this month . giscard d 'estaing remarked that turkey is not a " european country " and that it 's accession would bring about an " end of the eu .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .
hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .
struck also remained adamant that he would not send more troops to kuwait .
as if to highlight the spd 's internal disarray , struck 's own parliamentary state secretary , hans georg wagner , contradicted his minister , saying that the german troops and tanks would " naturally " be deployed in the event of an attack .
greens warn against involvement while the greens concede the possible use of the troops in kuwait , they remain firmly opposed to any other involvement in a possible war .
winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .
breach of international law ?
meanwhile , angelika beer , the greens ' expert on defense matters , questioned the legitimacy of chancellor gerhard schröder 's stance on allowing washington to use german airspace or u.s bases here in the event of a war .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
political pundits attribute schröder 's victory in september 's general election to his hardline anti-war stance .
however the conservative opposition says schröder will be forced to choose between breaking that promise , thereby deceiving the electorate , or risk further damaging us - german relations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates kuwait mandate germany ’ s defense minister has announced that german soldiers and tanks will stay in kuwait for six more months .
the greens are against such an extension and demand the troops ’ removal in the event of a war on iraq .

in germany , however , the living have rather limited choices .
burial or cremation in cemeteries are the only options on offer , with coffins and urns being the recommended and enforced method of internment .
but now , the government in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia wants to relax the rules for its dearly departed .
the plans on the table will allow people to bury their dead in their yards or keep the ashes of loved ones on the mantelpiece .
such things might be common practice in many countries , but in germany such suggestions have angered church authorities and conservative politicians who say changing the rules would be disrespectful to the dead .
but these days , many people believe they should have the choice to decide for themselves .
my bookshelf , my tomb bernd bruns , a craftsman from düsseldorf , does n't want to be buried in a cemetery when he dies .
his preference is to be cremated and have his ashes placed in an urn that will be kept in the home he has shared with his wife for most of his life .
bruns has been fighting for many years for the right to spend eternity looking down from his bookshelf .
" i 'd like to remain at home in the surroundings where i 've spent most of my time .
and i 'm not the only one who 'd like to do that , " bernd said in an interview with dw-tv .
he feels so strongly about the issue that he 's set up a popular web site , which provides tips on how to get around burial red tape and have your last wishes carried out to the letter .
standard practice in holland in the netherlands , widely recognized as the most " pro-choice " nation within europe , the dutch have already been granted more of a choice when it comes to planning that final resting place .
they can bury them in the cemetery , in their garden , at a private mausoleum or cast the cremated ashes to the four winds .

günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says .

current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .

the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .

germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .

after days of intense speculation , unconfirmed media reports and a slew of allegations regarding germany ’ s exact role in the case of military action against iraq and military requests from israel , chancellor gerhard schröder has finally spoken out in clear and unambiguous language .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in extracts of a newspaper interview released on tuesday , chancellor schröder confirmed that germany will provide israel with anti-missile systems .
" if the israeli government feels it needs this added security , we will help - and promptly , " schröder told the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" this is our moral and historical obligation ...
the security of the israeli state and its citizens is of utmost importance to us . "
patriot missiles only for defense purposes at the same time the chancellor stressed that the patriot missiles were purely defensive weapons .
" they offer protection against missile attacks .
the security of the state of israel and its citizens is of prime importance to us , " he said .
the social democrat foreign expert , gernot erler defended the government 's plan to deliver missiles to israel .
he said the request from jerusalem had nothing to do with a u.s. request for german support in a war against iraq .
the german defense ministry said israel had long ago expressed interest in acquiring new surplus patriot missiles from germany and had renewed its request a week ago .
the israeli embassy said the request was made a year ago , but that it had taken on a new urgency due to the looming iraq crisis .
israel is preparing for possible retaliation from iraq in the event of u.s. military action against the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fuchs the u.s.-built patriots are designed to intercept and shoot down incoming ballistic missiles and have a limited range .
additionally , the fact that the distance between iraq and israel is small , means that the early warning period is short .
in military circles there is a agreement that every additional defense system improves security according to the newspaper berliner zeitung .
in the 1991 gulf war iraq fired 39 scud missiles at israel , though the missiles have been updated since then .
german military supply to israel a sensitive issue though the chancellor ’ s ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens have denied that such a military delivery to israel would conflict with their vocal opposition to any future u.s.-led war against iraq , there are indications that the issue is a delicate one .
the deputy head of the social democrats , michael müller described israel ’ s request as " sensitive " and said that it would land the coalition in a difficult situation .
the request , he said couldn ’ t just be answered with a " simple nod of the head " .
even green party parliamentary leader winfried hermann is concerned that chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer ’ s emphasis that germany will not take part in military action against iraq , could now be interpreted loosely .
he said that the delivery is " part of a whole concept of germany 's indirect participation in a military exchange . "
hermann told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau that the german government should " keep their fingers off it . "
schröder says " no " to u.s. request for fuchs vehicles meanwhile in a news conference on wednesday chancellor schröder also shed more light on the much-speculated wish-list of the united states on german support in a war against iraq .
the chancellor confirmed that germany had agreed to grant flyover rights for u.s. forces and transport troops through germany in the event of military action against iraq .
he also said that washington had asked berlin to specifically provide defense systems against chemical , biological and nuclear attack as well as military police , missile defense systems and financial and material help for possible reconstruction of iraq .
but schröder made it clear that germany would refuse the use of its fuchs armored vehicles stationed in kuwait for any u.s-led military action against iraq . # b # he told reporters it remained " clear as glass " that the german parliament had only allowed a mandate for a twelve-month deployment in the " enduring freedom " action in the war against international terrorism .
" we don ’ t have the intention of moving away from this mandate , " he said .
germany will not be part of a military intervention in iraq , he added .
fuchs for israel but no more the german chancellor also said that germany would also fulfill another israeli request of providing some of its fuchs armored vehicles , which are equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination since there would be use to protect israel ’ s own population .
but schröder ruled out any further military help to israel .
" we do not intend to provide further resources beyond what i have said , and definitely no more personnel , " schröder said .
asked if germany would help rebuild iraq after a war , schröder said , " we expect that there will be no need for a military intervention and that is the german government ’ s political goal , and i think it would be wrong to assume the country will have to be rebuilt . "
schröder ’ s clear statements lay to rest speculation over the mission of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible u.s.-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
schröder criticised for stance on u.s. schröder ’ s permission for u.s. forces to use german airspace and allow them transit rights within germany in the event of war against iraq has led to criticism even within the ruling coalition .
angelika beer , the green party ’ s expert on defense matters questioned the legitimacy of the decision .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
germany ’ s conservative opposition has shown itself to be unsatisfied with chancellor schröder ’ s method of dealing with u.s. requests .
wolfgang schäuble , the foreign policy expert of the christian democratic party said that the chancellor ’ s explanations were not satisfactory .
the parliamentary chairman of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , wolfgang gerhardt said that schröder ’ s explanations do not end the discussion within the ruling coalition .
there are now fears that schröder ’ s categorical refusal in letting the u.s. use its fuchs vehicles might throw a shadow on already strained u.s.-german relations that were beginning to show signs of improvement of late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government in disarray over iraq there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .
hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .
struck also remained adamant that he would not send more troops to kuwait .
as if to highlight the spd 's internal disarray , struck 's own parliamentary state secretary , hans georg wagner , contradicted his minister , saying that the german troops and tanks would " naturally " be deployed in the event of an attack .
greens warn against involvement while the greens concede the possible use of the troops in kuwait , they remain firmly opposed to any other involvement in a possible war .
winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .

winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .
breach of international law ?
meanwhile , angelika beer , the greens ' expert on defense matters , questioned the legitimacy of chancellor gerhard schröder 's stance on allowing washington to use german airspace or u.s bases here in the event of a war .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
political pundits attribute schröder 's victory in september 's general election to his hardline anti-war stance .
however the conservative opposition says schröder will be forced to choose between breaking that promise , thereby deceiving the electorate , or risk further damaging us - german relations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates kuwait mandate germany ’ s defense minister has announced that german soldiers and tanks will stay in kuwait for six more months .

except in germany a german state 's plan to become the first to allow residents to bury their dead in their backyards is upsetting politicians and preachers alike . it 's the final choice you 'll make - what happens to your mortal remains after death has claimed you .
in germany , however , the living have rather limited choices .
burial or cremation in cemeteries are the only options on offer , with coffins and urns being the recommended and enforced method of internment .
but now , the government in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia wants to relax the rules for its dearly departed .
the plans on the table will allow people to bury their dead in their yards or keep the ashes of loved ones on the mantelpiece .
such things might be common practice in many countries , but in germany such suggestions have angered church authorities and conservative politicians who say changing the rules would be disrespectful to the dead .
but these days , many people believe they should have the choice to decide for themselves .
my bookshelf , my tomb bernd bruns , a craftsman from düsseldorf , does n't want to be buried in a cemetery when he dies .
his preference is to be cremated and have his ashes placed in an urn that will be kept in the home he has shared with his wife for most of his life .
bruns has been fighting for many years for the right to spend eternity looking down from his bookshelf .
" i 'd like to remain at home in the surroundings where i 've spent most of my time .
and i 'm not the only one who 'd like to do that , " bernd said in an interview with dw-tv .
he feels so strongly about the issue that he 's set up a popular web site , which provides tips on how to get around burial red tape and have your last wishes carried out to the letter .
standard practice in holland in the netherlands , widely recognized as the most " pro-choice " nation within europe , the dutch have already been granted more of a choice when it comes to planning that final resting place .
they can bury them in the cemetery , in their garden , at a private mausoleum or cast the cremated ashes to the four winds .
an urn is supplied after cremation only if the deceased had made provision for it in the will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt : not buried in the garden .
but this liberal attitude championed by bernd bruns , his supporters and the dutch is not shared by all .
there are many people who believe the dead have their place in consecrated ground and not in the back garden or house to be found by future unsuspecting generations .
günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says . " they may just think that it 's been sitting there quite a while and hand it over to the public sanitation services where it ends up in the rubbish . "
current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .
germany 's churches state that a coffin is mandatory and that even shrouding the corpse is against burial laws .
the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .
since exhumation is also strictly forbidden under islam and bodies must be buried as soon as possible , 90 percent of germany 's muslims are flown to islamic sites to be buried once they die .
germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .
" i 'm not concerned that lots of people are going to want to be buried without a coffin , " he told dw-tv .
" but it could help certain ethnic groups such as muslims - and why should n't we make some concessions to people from these religious communities when it does us no harm at all . "
the body should be returned to god , says church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church believes consecrated is best .
" judeo-christian tradition states that the remains of the dead should not be placed under our own control or those affiliated with us but should be returned to the hand of god ... through consecrated ground , " says father schwab of the protestant church in germany rhineland .
a decision date has yet to be set and the debate is likely to rage on even then .
however , after his years of campaigning , bernd bruns feels confident enough to have already bought an urn that he says fits very well in his bookcase . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de final farewell icy winds coursed through the british capital , making the line of people queing on lambeth bridge shiver as the crowd waited solemnly for the queen mother to pass .

but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold . a week after the leader of turkey ’ s new ruling party , tayyip erdogan , met german chancellor gerhard schröder , it ’ s now the turn of turkish president ahmet sezer -lrb- photo -rrb- to pay his regards in berlin and shore up support for his nation ’ s european union bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet necdet sezer turkey is pushing the eu to name a date for starting negotiations on accession to the european union at the copenhagen summit next month .
the visit is especially important for ankara , which sees berlin as a key partner in helping it secure a place in brussels .
germany is home to the largest turkish population in europe -lrb- 2.5 million -rrb- and has maintained close relations with ankara for decades .
german parties split over membership for turkey but despite those advantageous factors , the going will be anything but smooth for president sezer .
recent weeks have seen germany ’ s main political parties sharply divided over whether a muslim state of 66 million people should be permitted into a european union that is largely christian .
while the opposition christian democrats fear that admitting an islamic country would rock the balance in what they see as europe ’ s christian heritage , chancellor schröder ’ s ruling social democrat-green coalition government welcomes the idea and banks on the strategic advantage of future turkish membership .

conservative german politicians argue that the cultural and religious differences between turkey and the european union are insurmountable .

" if you define europe as ' christian , ' that would also exclude millions , millions of moslems who are already in the european union , " she said .
" it ’ s the second-biggest religious group within the eu already . "
the social democrats are instead trying to portray turkey as an shining example of a unique muslim state where islam and modernity can go hand in hand .
" we in europe see how turkey proves that islam and democracy can be reconciled in a society where state and religion are seperate .

while the opposition christian democrats fear that admitting an islamic country would rock the balance in what they see as europe ’ s christian heritage , chancellor schröder ’ s ruling social democrat-green coalition government welcomes the idea and banks on the strategic advantage of future turkish membership .
conservatives see turkey as " too different " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edmund stoiber speaking on friday before a christian social union party congress , former conservative chancellor candidate edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- said : " europe is a community that is based on western values .
as a community of shared values , europe has to deal with the question of its borders .
these borders must be based on shared values , culture and history .
turkey ’ s membership would breach these borders . "
conservative german politicians argue that the cultural and religious differences between turkey and the european union are insurmountable .
roland koch -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the premier of the state of hessen , said in a television interview recently , " i believe europe needs a constitution which is an oath to god - that ’ s a european tradition .
of course , we can ’ t blame the turks for holding a different view , but it shows that there are other traditions outside europe and we mustn ’ t ignore that fact . "
greens and spd say turkey is " unique " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth claudia roth -lrb- photo -rrb- , chairwoman of the ruling green party thinks that such an argument is " dangerous " .
" if you define europe as ' christian , ' that would also exclude millions , millions of moslems who are already in the european union , " she said .
" it ’ s the second-biggest religious group within the eu already . "
the social democrats are instead trying to portray turkey as an shining example of a unique muslim state where islam and modernity can go hand in hand .
" we in europe see how turkey proves that islam and democracy can be reconciled in a society where state and religion are seperate .
this is a great hope which we should support because it 's a unique case , " a foreign policy spokesman of the spd said .
more problems for germany with turkish accession ?
but away from the delicate question of european heritage and identity , other factors , too , have germany ’ s political parties worried .
germany ’ s conservative parties fear that turkish membership would open the flood gates to a wave of many more muslim immigrants to join families in german cities .
turkey 's failure to fulfill all criteria for eu membership on issues including its human rights record , the rights of its kurdish minority and the cyprus conflict , also remains a matter of concern for parties across the political spectrum .
anti-turkish rumblings across europe the hard-line stance against turkey among germany 's opposition politicians has been echoed across europe .
the current debate started after valéry giscard d 'estaing , the head of the convent charged with drafting a european constitution , made controversial statements earlier this month . giscard d 'estaing remarked that turkey is not a " european country " and that it 's accession would bring about an " end of the eu .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .
hans ulrich klose , an spd expert on foreign affairs , said that the fox vehicles should be put at the disposal of the united states in the event of a war on iraq .
struck , however , rejected the idea .
" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .
struck also remained adamant that he would not send more troops to kuwait .
as if to highlight the spd 's internal disarray , struck 's own parliamentary state secretary , hans georg wagner , contradicted his minister , saying that the german troops and tanks would " naturally " be deployed in the event of an attack .
greens warn against involvement while the greens concede the possible use of the troops in kuwait , they remain firmly opposed to any other involvement in a possible war .
winfried nachtwei , the greens ' parliamentary group 's spokesman on defense policy , warned of germany being dragged into a conflict against its will .
" we must ensure that we do n't find ourselves sliding toward a war in iraq , " he said , arguing that the deployment of other weapons such as missiles would constitute an impermissible contribution to a war effort .
he was referring to newspaper reports over the weekend that the u.s. had asked the berlin government for anti-aircraft missiles in the case of a war .
defense minister peter struck denied that was the case .
" the report is false , " he said .
the report , quoting senior government officials , said washington had asked germany to prepare to provide an unspecified number of patriot missiles .
the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .
breach of international law ?
meanwhile , angelika beer , the greens ' expert on defense matters , questioned the legitimacy of chancellor gerhard schröder 's stance on allowing washington to use german airspace or u.s bases here in the event of a war .
" if there is no clear international law mandating a war , then there can be no decree granting airspace , because this would effectively constitute involvement in a war violating international law , something the chancellor has ruled out , " she said .
political pundits attribute schröder 's victory in september 's general election to his hardline anti-war stance .

the officials allegedly hinted that the request would be difficult to turn down if it was intended to defend israel or turkey .
however , on tuesday the german government confirmed that israel had asked the german military for patriot missiles but that the request was a year old .
a spokesman said the request had been renewed last week .
defense minister peter struck said he would provide details of the israeli request to the parliamentary group leaders on wednesday and would also inform them of any demands made by the united states for a german contribution to a possible war on iraq .

there 's more trouble brewing for the social democratic-green coalition - this time over the involvement of german troops and equipment in a possible iraq conflict . with internecine squabbling fast becoming the german government 's trademark , the coalition partners have duely launched their next potentially damaging dispute .
this time it 's over the use of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible united states-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
these can be used to detect chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .
dispute over kuwait mission over the weekend , it emerged that several leading members of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens are at odds with the spd 's peter struck , germany 's defense minister , over the force 's possible mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these bundeswehr vehicles could be used to help allied forces detect chemical weapons in an iraqi war .

" i do not share klose 's view , " he said , citing constitutional problems and the german government 's mandate on fighting terrorism which does not extend to committing german troops to a war against iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.11.2002 skeletons in the backyard ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burial - your way .
except in germany a german state 's plan to become the first to allow residents to bury their dead in their backyards is upsetting politicians and preachers alike . it 's the final choice you 'll make - what happens to your mortal remains after death has claimed you .
in germany , however , the living have rather limited choices .
burial or cremation in cemeteries are the only options on offer , with coffins and urns being the recommended and enforced method of internment .
but now , the government in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia wants to relax the rules for its dearly departed .
the plans on the table will allow people to bury their dead in their yards or keep the ashes of loved ones on the mantelpiece .
such things might be common practice in many countries , but in germany such suggestions have angered church authorities and conservative politicians who say changing the rules would be disrespectful to the dead .
but these days , many people believe they should have the choice to decide for themselves .
my bookshelf , my tomb bernd bruns , a craftsman from düsseldorf , does n't want to be buried in a cemetery when he dies .
his preference is to be cremated and have his ashes placed in an urn that will be kept in the home he has shared with his wife for most of his life .
bruns has been fighting for many years for the right to spend eternity looking down from his bookshelf .
" i 'd like to remain at home in the surroundings where i 've spent most of my time .
and i 'm not the only one who 'd like to do that , " bernd said in an interview with dw-tv .
he feels so strongly about the issue that he 's set up a popular web site , which provides tips on how to get around burial red tape and have your last wishes carried out to the letter .
standard practice in holland in the netherlands , widely recognized as the most " pro-choice " nation within europe , the dutch have already been granted more of a choice when it comes to planning that final resting place .
they can bury them in the cemetery , in their garden , at a private mausoleum or cast the cremated ashes to the four winds .
an urn is supplied after cremation only if the deceased had made provision for it in the will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt : not buried in the garden .
but this liberal attitude championed by bernd bruns , his supporters and the dutch is not shared by all .
there are many people who believe the dead have their place in consecrated ground and not in the back garden or house to be found by future unsuspecting generations .
günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says . " they may just think that it 's been sitting there quite a while and hand it over to the public sanitation services where it ends up in the rubbish . "
current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .
germany 's churches state that a coffin is mandatory and that even shrouding the corpse is against burial laws .
the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .
since exhumation is also strictly forbidden under islam and bodies must be buried as soon as possible , 90 percent of germany 's muslims are flown to islamic sites to be buried once they die .
germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .
" i 'm not concerned that lots of people are going to want to be buried without a coffin , " he told dw-tv .
" but it could help certain ethnic groups such as muslims - and why should n't we make some concessions to people from these religious communities when it does us no harm at all . "
the body should be returned to god , says church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church believes consecrated is best .

except in germany a german state 's plan to become the first to allow residents to bury their dead in their backyards is upsetting politicians and preachers alike . it 's the final choice you 'll make - what happens to your mortal remains after death has claimed you .
in germany , however , the living have rather limited choices .
burial or cremation in cemeteries are the only options on offer , with coffins and urns being the recommended and enforced method of internment .
but now , the government in the western german state of north-rhine westphalia wants to relax the rules for its dearly departed .
the plans on the table will allow people to bury their dead in their yards or keep the ashes of loved ones on the mantelpiece .
such things might be common practice in many countries , but in germany such suggestions have angered church authorities and conservative politicians who say changing the rules would be disrespectful to the dead .
but these days , many people believe they should have the choice to decide for themselves .
my bookshelf , my tomb bernd bruns , a craftsman from düsseldorf , does n't want to be buried in a cemetery when he dies .
his preference is to be cremated and have his ashes placed in an urn that will be kept in the home he has shared with his wife for most of his life .
bruns has been fighting for many years for the right to spend eternity looking down from his bookshelf .
" i 'd like to remain at home in the surroundings where i 've spent most of my time .
and i 'm not the only one who 'd like to do that , " bernd said in an interview with dw-tv .
he feels so strongly about the issue that he 's set up a popular web site , which provides tips on how to get around burial red tape and have your last wishes carried out to the letter .
standard practice in holland in the netherlands , widely recognized as the most " pro-choice " nation within europe , the dutch have already been granted more of a choice when it comes to planning that final resting place .
they can bury them in the cemetery , in their garden , at a private mausoleum or cast the cremated ashes to the four winds .
an urn is supplied after cremation only if the deceased had made provision for it in the will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt : not buried in the garden .
but this liberal attitude championed by bernd bruns , his supporters and the dutch is not shared by all .
there are many people who believe the dead have their place in consecrated ground and not in the back garden or house to be found by future unsuspecting generations .
günter luhmann , a funeral director , goes cold when he considers the possibility of someone making an unwitting discovery .
" it makes me shudder to think of the deceased landing on a dump because people who have no relation to the dead person or do n't even know what 's in the box or urn , " he says . " they may just think that it 's been sitting there quite a while and hand it over to the public sanitation services where it ends up in the rubbish . "
current burial laws problematic for muslims in addition to the proposed changes to regulations controlling the burial of the dead in german cemeteries , there are further calls for rules concerning cremation or burial in coffins to be scrapped .
germany 's churches state that a coffin is mandatory and that even shrouding the corpse is against burial laws .
the issue has been a problem for years in germany , which has seen dramatic growth in its muslim population .
islamic burial requirements ban the use of coffins and , therefore , contravene public health laws .
since exhumation is also strictly forbidden under islam and bodies must be buried as soon as possible , 90 percent of germany 's muslims are flown to islamic sites to be buried once they die .
germany has no muslim cemeteries , but there are plans to build one in berlin . hermann weber of aeternitas , a german consumer organization that deals with cemetaries and funeral services , supports the idea that the laws requiring the use of coffins in burials should be removed , in order to show sensitivity to the religious beliefs of germany 's multicultural and multi-faith society .
" i 'm not concerned that lots of people are going to want to be buried without a coffin , " he told dw-tv .
" but it could help certain ethnic groups such as muslims - and why should n't we make some concessions to people from these religious communities when it does us no harm at all . "
the body should be returned to god , says church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church believes consecrated is best .

after days of intense speculation , unconfirmed media reports and a slew of allegations regarding germany ’ s exact role in the case of military action against iraq and military requests from israel , chancellor gerhard schröder has finally spoken out in clear and unambiguous language .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder in extracts of a newspaper interview released on tuesday , chancellor schröder confirmed that germany will provide israel with anti-missile systems .

the security of the state of israel and its citizens is of prime importance to us , " he said .
the social democrat foreign expert , gernot erler defended the government 's plan to deliver missiles to israel .
he said the request from jerusalem had nothing to do with a u.s. request for german support in a war against iraq .
the german defense ministry said israel had long ago expressed interest in acquiring new surplus patriot missiles from germany and had renewed its request a week ago .
the israeli embassy said the request was made a year ago , but that it had taken on a new urgency due to the looming iraq crisis .
israel is preparing for possible retaliation from iraq in the event of u.s. military action against the country .

the deputy head of the social democrats , michael müller described israel ’ s request as " sensitive " and said that it would land the coalition in a difficult situation .
the request , he said couldn ’ t just be answered with a " simple nod of the head " .
even green party parliamentary leader winfried hermann is concerned that chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer ’ s emphasis that germany will not take part in military action against iraq , could now be interpreted loosely .
he said that the delivery is " part of a whole concept of germany 's indirect participation in a military exchange . "
hermann told the newspaper frankfurter rundschau that the german government should " keep their fingers off it . "
schröder says " no " to u.s. request for fuchs vehicles meanwhile in a news conference on wednesday chancellor schröder also shed more light on the much-speculated wish-list of the united states on german support in a war against iraq .
the chancellor confirmed that germany had agreed to grant flyover rights for u.s. forces and transport troops through germany in the event of military action against iraq .
he also said that washington had asked berlin to specifically provide defense systems against chemical , biological and nuclear attack as well as military police , missile defense systems and financial and material help for possible reconstruction of iraq .
but schröder made it clear that germany would refuse the use of its fuchs armored vehicles stationed in kuwait for any u.s-led military action against iraq . # b # he told reporters it remained " clear as glass " that the german parliament had only allowed a mandate for a twelve-month deployment in the " enduring freedom " action in the war against international terrorism .
" we don ’ t have the intention of moving away from this mandate , " he said .
germany will not be part of a military intervention in iraq , he added .
fuchs for israel but no more the german chancellor also said that germany would also fulfill another israeli request of providing some of its fuchs armored vehicles , which are equipped to detect chemical , biological and nuclear contamination since there would be use to protect israel ’ s own population .
but schröder ruled out any further military help to israel .
" we do not intend to provide further resources beyond what i have said , and definitely no more personnel , " schröder said .
asked if germany would help rebuild iraq after a war , schröder said , " we expect that there will be no need for a military intervention and that is the german government ’ s political goal , and i think it would be wrong to assume the country will have to be rebuilt . "
schröder ’ s clear statements lay to rest speculation over the mission of german troops stationed in kuwait in a possible u.s.-led war on iraq .
there are currently 52 soldiers and six fox reconnaissance armoured vehicles based in kuwait .
schröder criticised for stance on u.s. schröder ’ s permission for u.s. forces to use german airspace and allow them transit rights within germany in the event of war against iraq has led to criticism even within the ruling coalition .
angelika beer , the green party ’ s expert on defense matters questioned the legitimacy of the decision .

the cemetery near st pancras station in north london is to be removed to make way for the new terminal for the channel tunnel rail link .
archaeologists , who had hoped to have another two months to identify the graves and try to contact living relatives , have been told their time is up .
the construction consortium building the line said archaeologists always knew there was only a limited opportunity for investigation . "
i do n't think it is showing respect in the treatment of the dead people in the cemetery " catherine cavanagh , english heritage the channel tunnel rail link company -lrb- ctrl -rrb- has been able to avoid the normal special permission required when building work disturbs a cemetery .
it operates under a 1996 act of parliament , giving it permission to remove graves as long as the work is done with respect and dignity for the dead .
the company said it does not know how many graves will be destroyed and did not reveal how the graves will removed .
a spokesman said : " we have all the relevant permissions required to carry out this process and are currently working with a competent specialist contractor to find the most appropriate methods . "
english heritage , the curator for the site , says the company will send in bulldozers to tip the graves in one mass pile .
the remains will then be taken away and re-interred at another cemetery in north london .
catherine cavanagh from english heritage said : " it will become like one mass grave .
" i do n't think it is showing respect in the treatment of the dead people in the cemetery .
" as well as the ethical aspect , there is a fantastic amount of information that will be lost . "
archaeologists had hoped to gather important evidence about life in london during the industrial revolution from the cemetary , which was first used in 1792 .
english heritage said there were around 4,000 graves .

if the drought breaks , then we 'll have growth .
if it does n't , then we 'll be winding back these forecasts " peter costello treasurer the main culprit , he said , is the 60 % slump in crop production the dry weather has caused .

the country managed 4 % a year growth amid a housing boom triggered by low interest rates , and export industries have remained in good shape .

in all , 90 % of the country is being affected , the government 's agricultural bureau says , and the 57 % fall in projected winter grain crops could cut export earnings by as much as 5.4bn australian dollars -lrb- us $ 3bn ; £ 1.9bn -rrb- .
still bullish still , mr costello refused to be pessimistic about the longer-term prospects .
" look , 2003-4 depends to some degree on whether or not the drought breaks , " he told parliament .
" if the drought breaks , then we 'll have growth .
if it does n't , then we 'll be winding back these forecasts . "
