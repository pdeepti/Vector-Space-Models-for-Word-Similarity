at its national convention over the weekend , germany ’ s leftist party - the democratic socialists - failed to overcome internal infighting over party policy .
is there a future for the former communist party ? it ca n't be much fun being a pds member at the moment . in last month 's federal elections , the successors to east germany ’ s former ruling communist party , the party of democratic socialism , failed to gain enough votes to return them to parliament . having failed to clamber over the necessary five-percent hurdle , the leftist party decided it was time for some serious restructuring .
and meeting in gera , in eastern germany this weekend , party members attempted to discuss their future political course .
but after two days of discussion , the resurrection of the primarily eastern german party seems even less likely than before .
a fully-fledged power struggle between the two internal factions erupted : the traditionalists took the upper hand over the pragmatists who favored stronger cooperation with the ruling mainstream coalition of social democrats and the ecology-minded greens .
the traditional core of pds members is in favor of the party maintaining its alternative , opposition stance , even if it means not being considered as partners in coalitions as is the case in berlin .
despite the differences in ideology , the delegates did manage to reconfirm party leader gabi zimmer by a comfortable majority , leaving her only challenger , former party floor leader roland claus way behind .
the party faithful had blamed zimmer for a lacklustre campaign earlier this year .
however , grassroots support for major changes within the party , including the election of a new leader , was low in gera .
as a result , the reform-minded pragmatists refused to cooperate with the new leader .
party split reiner oschmann , a pds spokesman , described the atmosphere over the weekend as " very turbulent . "
speaking to dw-radio , oschmann explained that what the party had witnessed in gera was a " kind of split between two wings inside the party , with the one wing coming out victorious and the other side obviously pretty disappointed and de-motivated . "
the spokesman warned that it was still too early to say what exactly the split will mean for the new elected party leadership .
he cautioned against jumping to any conclusions about the general course of the pds in the years ahead .
however , most political analysts believe that the outcome of the gera convention spells the beginning of the end for a party that used to have a strong base in eastern germany , but failed to make inroads in the west .
the end of germany ’ s leftists ?
the continued opposition to a drastic party reform , the observers argue , means the pds will slide into total insignificance .
according to oschmann , such a development would be disastrous , because in his view a left-wing party like the pds is needed in germany more than ever before .
" the economic and social problems in the country cry out for an alternative party .
it is enough just to refer to the fact that unemployment is about 8 percent in the west but about 18 percent in the east .
this indicates a strong , and even growing divide between east and west .
all these problems have to be tackled .
and that cries out for a left-wing party . "
but although the pds is currently suffering an identity crisis and seems to be stalled on its way to reform , the party has a more serious demographic problem .
more than 80 percent of the party ’ s followers are over 60 years old .

at its national convention over the weekend , germany ’ s leftist party - the democratic socialists - failed to overcome internal infighting over party policy .
is there a future for the former communist party ? it ca n't be much fun being a pds member at the moment . in last month 's federal elections , the successors to east germany ’ s former ruling communist party , the party of democratic socialism , failed to gain enough votes to return them to parliament . having failed to clamber over the necessary five-percent hurdle , the leftist party decided it was time for some serious restructuring .
and meeting in gera , in eastern germany this weekend , party members attempted to discuss their future political course .
but after two days of discussion , the resurrection of the primarily eastern german party seems even less likely than before .
a fully-fledged power struggle between the two internal factions erupted : the traditionalists took the upper hand over the pragmatists who favored stronger cooperation with the ruling mainstream coalition of social democrats and the ecology-minded greens .
the traditional core of pds members is in favor of the party maintaining its alternative , opposition stance , even if it means not being considered as partners in coalitions as is the case in berlin .
despite the differences in ideology , the delegates did manage to reconfirm party leader gabi zimmer by a comfortable majority , leaving her only challenger , former party floor leader roland claus way behind .
the party faithful had blamed zimmer for a lacklustre campaign earlier this year .
however , grassroots support for major changes within the party , including the election of a new leader , was low in gera .
as a result , the reform-minded pragmatists refused to cooperate with the new leader .
party split reiner oschmann , a pds spokesman , described the atmosphere over the weekend as " very turbulent . "
speaking to dw-radio , oschmann explained that what the party had witnessed in gera was a " kind of split between two wings inside the party , with the one wing coming out victorious and the other side obviously pretty disappointed and de-motivated . "
the spokesman warned that it was still too early to say what exactly the split will mean for the new elected party leadership .
he cautioned against jumping to any conclusions about the general course of the pds in the years ahead .
however , most political analysts believe that the outcome of the gera convention spells the beginning of the end for a party that used to have a strong base in eastern germany , but failed to make inroads in the west .
the end of germany ’ s leftists ?
the continued opposition to a drastic party reform , the observers argue , means the pds will slide into total insignificance .
according to oschmann , such a development would be disastrous , because in his view a left-wing party like the pds is needed in germany more than ever before .
" the economic and social problems in the country cry out for an alternative party .
it is enough just to refer to the fact that unemployment is about 8 percent in the west but about 18 percent in the east .
this indicates a strong , and even growing divide between east and west .
all these problems have to be tackled .
and that cries out for a left-wing party . "

despite the differences in ideology , the delegates did manage to reconfirm party leader gabi zimmer by a comfortable majority , leaving her only challenger , former party floor leader roland claus way behind .
the party faithful had blamed zimmer for a lacklustre campaign earlier this year .
however , grassroots support for major changes within the party , including the election of a new leader , was low in gera .
as a result , the reform-minded pragmatists refused to cooperate with the new leader .
party split reiner oschmann , a pds spokesman , described the atmosphere over the weekend as " very turbulent . "
speaking to dw-radio , oschmann explained that what the party had witnessed in gera was a " kind of split between two wings inside the party , with the one wing coming out victorious and the other side obviously pretty disappointed and de-motivated . "
the spokesman warned that it was still too early to say what exactly the split will mean for the new elected party leadership .
he cautioned against jumping to any conclusions about the general course of the pds in the years ahead .

at its national convention over the weekend , germany ’ s leftist party - the democratic socialists - failed to overcome internal infighting over party policy .
is there a future for the former communist party ? it ca n't be much fun being a pds member at the moment . in last month 's federal elections , the successors to east germany ’ s former ruling communist party , the party of democratic socialism , failed to gain enough votes to return them to parliament . having failed to clamber over the necessary five-percent hurdle , the leftist party decided it was time for some serious restructuring .
and meeting in gera , in eastern germany this weekend , party members attempted to discuss their future political course .
but after two days of discussion , the resurrection of the primarily eastern german party seems even less likely than before .
a fully-fledged power struggle between the two internal factions erupted : the traditionalists took the upper hand over the pragmatists who favored stronger cooperation with the ruling mainstream coalition of social democrats and the ecology-minded greens .
the traditional core of pds members is in favor of the party maintaining its alternative , opposition stance , even if it means not being considered as partners in coalitions as is the case in berlin .
despite the differences in ideology , the delegates did manage to reconfirm party leader gabi zimmer by a comfortable majority , leaving her only challenger , former party floor leader roland claus way behind .
the party faithful had blamed zimmer for a lacklustre campaign earlier this year .
however , grassroots support for major changes within the party , including the election of a new leader , was low in gera .
as a result , the reform-minded pragmatists refused to cooperate with the new leader .
party split reiner oschmann , a pds spokesman , described the atmosphere over the weekend as " very turbulent . "
speaking to dw-radio , oschmann explained that what the party had witnessed in gera was a " kind of split between two wings inside the party , with the one wing coming out victorious and the other side obviously pretty disappointed and de-motivated . "
the spokesman warned that it was still too early to say what exactly the split will mean for the new elected party leadership .
he cautioned against jumping to any conclusions about the general course of the pds in the years ahead .
however , most political analysts believe that the outcome of the gera convention spells the beginning of the end for a party that used to have a strong base in eastern germany , but failed to make inroads in the west .
the end of germany ’ s leftists ?
the continued opposition to a drastic party reform , the observers argue , means the pds will slide into total insignificance .
according to oschmann , such a development would be disastrous , because in his view a left-wing party like the pds is needed in germany more than ever before .
" the economic and social problems in the country cry out for an alternative party .
it is enough just to refer to the fact that unemployment is about 8 percent in the west but about 18 percent in the east .
this indicates a strong , and even growing divide between east and west .
all these problems have to be tackled .
and that cries out for a left-wing party . "
but although the pds is currently suffering an identity crisis and seems to be stalled on its way to reform , the party has a more serious demographic problem .
more than 80 percent of the party ’ s followers are over 60 years old .

at its national convention over the weekend , germany ’ s leftist party - the democratic socialists - failed to overcome internal infighting over party policy .
is there a future for the former communist party ? it ca n't be much fun being a pds member at the moment . in last month 's federal elections , the successors to east germany ’ s former ruling communist party , the party of democratic socialism , failed to gain enough votes to return them to parliament . having failed to clamber over the necessary five-percent hurdle , the leftist party decided it was time for some serious restructuring .
and meeting in gera , in eastern germany this weekend , party members attempted to discuss their future political course .
but after two days of discussion , the resurrection of the primarily eastern german party seems even less likely than before .
a fully-fledged power struggle between the two internal factions erupted : the traditionalists took the upper hand over the pragmatists who favored stronger cooperation with the ruling mainstream coalition of social democrats and the ecology-minded greens .
the traditional core of pds members is in favor of the party maintaining its alternative , opposition stance , even if it means not being considered as partners in coalitions as is the case in berlin .
despite the differences in ideology , the delegates did manage to reconfirm party leader gabi zimmer by a comfortable majority , leaving her only challenger , former party floor leader roland claus way behind .
the party faithful had blamed zimmer for a lacklustre campaign earlier this year .
however , grassroots support for major changes within the party , including the election of a new leader , was low in gera .
as a result , the reform-minded pragmatists refused to cooperate with the new leader .
party split reiner oschmann , a pds spokesman , described the atmosphere over the weekend as " very turbulent . "
speaking to dw-radio , oschmann explained that what the party had witnessed in gera was a " kind of split between two wings inside the party , with the one wing coming out victorious and the other side obviously pretty disappointed and de-motivated . "
the spokesman warned that it was still too early to say what exactly the split will mean for the new elected party leadership .
he cautioned against jumping to any conclusions about the general course of the pds in the years ahead .
however , most political analysts believe that the outcome of the gera convention spells the beginning of the end for a party that used to have a strong base in eastern germany , but failed to make inroads in the west .
the end of germany ’ s leftists ?
the continued opposition to a drastic party reform , the observers argue , means the pds will slide into total insignificance .
according to oschmann , such a development would be disastrous , because in his view a left-wing party like the pds is needed in germany more than ever before .
" the economic and social problems in the country cry out for an alternative party .
it is enough just to refer to the fact that unemployment is about 8 percent in the west but about 18 percent in the east .
this indicates a strong , and even growing divide between east and west .

the spokesman said that figure pointed to the potential size of the tourism market in scotland .
he added that it has been estimated that the disabled population in the uk has a potential spending power of £ 20bn .

the unit has carried out more than 400 transplants since it opened , but there was a warning that scotland is facing a severe shortage of donor organs .
deputy health minister mary mulligan appealed for more scots to think positively about organ donation , discuss their wishes with their loved ones and carry an organ donor card .
she made her plea at a ceremony at edinburgh 's murrayfield stadium to mark the liver transplant unit 's anniversary .
mary mulligan appealed for more scots to become donors mrs mulligan said : " around 6,000 people across the uk need an organ transplant each year but only around 2,800 transplants are carried out because the number of people donating organs in recent years has fallen and is continuing to fall .
" at the scottish liver transplant unit , as at all our transplant units , highly dedicated transplant teams are helping to save and prolong the lives of many scots who are seriously ill .
" but unless we address the chronic shortage of donor organs in this country and the rest of the uk , future opportunities to save more lives will be lost . "
ad campaigns mrs mulligan said it was vital members of the public were reminded about the importance of organ donation and the best ways to do it .
she added : " unless more people continue to donate organs , thousands of people will face an increasingly impaired quality of life or , in many cases , death . "
the deputy minister said the scottish executive was keen to promote the idea and was already working on various initiatives including school projects and advertising campaigns .
the unit is based at the royal infirmary in edinburgh .
donors needed before it opened in 1992 scottish patients who required liver transplantation had to travel south of the border , usually to birmingham , for their care .
professor james garden , director of the unit , said : " the continuing success of transplantation in scotland is totally dependent on the availability of donors .
" we are very conscious that our patients have benefited from someone else 's loss , but would urge everyone to consider registering as an organ donor so that future patients in scotland will benefit . "
since it opened it has carried out more than 400 transplants and on sunday more than 150 of the people it has given a new liver to , got together for a party at murrayfield stadium .

the jakarta stock exchange index closed at a four-year low of 337.4 points , down 38.9 points , or 10.4 % , while the local currency , the rupiah , fell 3.5 % from friday to finished the day at 9,330 to the us dollar .
the central bank , bank indonesia , has intervened in the markets to prop up the rupiah and may have to raise interest rates to further defend the currency .
the falls had a knock-on effect on markets around asia , especially in the philippines , another country seen as potentially vulnerable to terrorist attacks .
and in the longer term , the weekend bomb has raised questions over indonesia 's fragile economy , which is highly dependent on tourist income from bali .
call for action the indonesian government has insisted that the attack will not fundamentally change the economic outlook .
the finance ministry said it would not change its target exchange rate for the rupiah , a necessary part of state budget calculation .
but most analysts warned that some sort of action would be necessary to avoid a short-term economic shock .
" i think the central bank will stop cutting its rates for the moment and might even start raising them again , " bank mandiri chief economist martin panggabean told the jakarta post newspaper .
the central bank has also been selling dollars for rupiah , hoping to support the exchange rate .
money worries but while monday 's slides may be rapidly reversed , the main concern is over the longer-term impact on the country 's economy .
serious security worries could persuade foreign firms to leave the country .
" the bomb blast in bali will create the perception that investment in indonesia is very risky , " said rifan financindo securities analyst hari ajid .
investors on the ground in indonesia have long been nervous about political instability , and have only started setting up in large numbers since the arrival of president megawati sukarnoputri last year - something that spurred a modest economic boom in recent months .
peace shattered making matters worse ; any damage to bali 's tourist industry will have a disproportionate effect on the indonesian economy .
bali receives about 1.5 million visitors a year , roughly one-third of the indonesian total .
and while much of the rest of the country struggles to bring in foreign exchange , bali 's visitors tend to be free-spending western tourists .
bali 's attraction as a tourist destination is largely based on its reputation as safe and peaceful .

south korea 's largest car maker said the chinese government had given it the go-ahead for a project that could produce 500,000 vehicles a year in china by 2010 .
the company 's joint venture with beijing automotive industry holding will start making hyundai 's ef sonata and elantra xd passenger cars near the chinese capital from the end of this year .
by entering china , hyundai joins a long and growing roster of foreign car makers in the world 's fastest-growing major market .
in recent years , global manufacturers - including volkswagen , general motors , nissan , fiat and psa peugeot citroen - have set up production facilities , and japan 's toyota unveiled its first chinese-made car last week .
growing market the chinese market is one of the few sources of serious growth in an industry that is facing stagnant demand throughout much of the world .
the country 's car market is expected to grow 40 % to one million passenger cars this year , with obvious room for much more growth - especially as china has just joined the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- .
under its commitments to the wto , china is to end its current restrictions on joint ventures between local and foreign firms within the next two years .
the hyundai deal comes at a time of increasing commercial activity between china and korea .
over the weekend , china 's third-largest car firm , shanghai automotive , said it would invest $ 60m -lrb- £ 38.4m -rrb- in a venture to take over three plants belonging to south korea 's bankrupt daewoo motor .
experienced hyundai said it would initially invest $ 100m in the joint venture and raise its investment to $ 1.1bn by 2010 .
the company feels that its experience in the market for small budget cars will be crucial in the chinese market , where the growth is expected to come from the relatively impoverished majority .
the firm , 10 % owned by daimlerchrysler , already has some knowledge of the market .
it already operates five chinese auto ventures making vehicles ranging from four-wheel-drives to commercial vehicles .

kaylee davidson was just five months old when she had the transplant on 14 october 1987 .
she suffered cardiomyopathy - a disease which destroyed the heart muscle - and her only hope was to receive a new organ .
the teenager from washington , tyne and wear , is now a vociferous campaigner for organ donation .
kaylee - who has two sisters lindsay , 14 and 11-year-old rebecca - said : " if it was n't for organ donors i would n't be here today .
" it is very important for people to sign up to the donor register and , most importantly , discuss their wishes with their families to give people like me a chance to live . "
since kaylee 's transplant at newcastle 's freeman hospital , more than 100 children have received new organs at its paediatric transplant unit .
' very lucky ' kaylee 's mother carol has organised a gala dinner at the end of the month to raise cash for the organ donor campaign .
she said : " if it had n't been for the generosity of another family i would n't have my daughter today .
" she is into boys , discos , make-up and gareth gates is god at the moment .
" at the time there had been no previous successes and here we are 15 years later with a child , or a young woman now , who is happy at school , has lots of friends and leading as normal a life as possible .
" we are very lucky . "
