" they have n't said yes yet , " u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said at the close of the vienna meeting .
only a day earlier , annan seemed more optimistic .
he said he hoped for " conclusive decisions " on the return of the arms experts , who left on the eve of a december 1998 bombing raid to punish iraq for blocking their work .
the un wants to see its arms inspectors return to iraq after an absence of more than three years . the international body is demanding the return of the inspectors as a prerequisite for the lifting of sanctions that have been in place for 12 years .
u.s. president george w. bush has repeatedly warned hussein he would face serious consequences if he continued to prevent inspectors from examining whether iraq is continuing to clandestinely develop its prohibited nuclear , biological , chemical and balistic missile programmes .
wasting arsenal on paper iraq still keeps what seems like an impressive military arsenal .
but this arsenal is slowly wasting away .
iraq has not been able to modernise its armed forces , spare parts are scarce , co-ordination is insufficient and pilots have been greatly restricted due to u.s.-imposed no-fly zones .
in addition , the morale of iraqi forces is said to be weak .
large parts of the iraqi forces simply ran away and surrendered during operation desert storm .
hidden resources but what is still unclear is whether iraq has significant biological and chemical weapons to deploy against an invading force .
should the weapons inspectors be allowed back to baghdad , finding out what resources hussein is hiding would be their main objective .
" has iraq attempted to rebuild its atomic arsenal ?
this is the big question " , atomic energy agency spokeswoman melissa flemming said .
" without the possiblity to go everywhere , to look at each building , to interview each person , to look at each document , - without these possibilities we will never be sure whether something is being made in secret " . " we definitely need access " , flemming said .
third time running fears that iraq may pass on its knowledge of chemical or biological warfare to terrorist groups have led to repeated talk of a " regime change " within u.s. ranks .
asked whether u.s. threats against hussein had been the catalyst for the talks , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said that was not what had " propelled " him here .
however , this is the third meeting between the un and iraq to discuss a possible return of arms inspectors to baghdad .
so far , no breakthrough has been achieved on this matter .
but un diplomats did hail one agreement on thursday as " significant " .

" they have n't said yes yet , " u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said at the close of the vienna meeting .
only a day earlier , annan seemed more optimistic .
he said he hoped for " conclusive decisions " on the return of the arms experts , who left on the eve of a december 1998 bombing raid to punish iraq for blocking their work .
the un wants to see its arms inspectors return to iraq after an absence of more than three years . the international body is demanding the return of the inspectors as a prerequisite for the lifting of sanctions that have been in place for 12 years .
u.s. president george w. bush has repeatedly warned hussein he would face serious consequences if he continued to prevent inspectors from examining whether iraq is continuing to clandestinely develop its prohibited nuclear , biological , chemical and balistic missile programmes .
wasting arsenal on paper iraq still keeps what seems like an impressive military arsenal .
but this arsenal is slowly wasting away .
iraq has not been able to modernise its armed forces , spare parts are scarce , co-ordination is insufficient and pilots have been greatly restricted due to u.s.-imposed no-fly zones .
in addition , the morale of iraqi forces is said to be weak .
large parts of the iraqi forces simply ran away and surrendered during operation desert storm .
hidden resources but what is still unclear is whether iraq has significant biological and chemical weapons to deploy against an invading force .
should the weapons inspectors be allowed back to baghdad , finding out what resources hussein is hiding would be their main objective .
" has iraq attempted to rebuild its atomic arsenal ?
this is the big question " , atomic energy agency spokeswoman melissa flemming said .
" without the possiblity to go everywhere , to look at each building , to interview each person , to look at each document , - without these possibilities we will never be sure whether something is being made in secret " . " we definitely need access " , flemming said .

u.s. president george w. bush has repeatedly warned hussein he would face serious consequences if he continued to prevent inspectors from examining whether iraq is continuing to clandestinely develop its prohibited nuclear , biological , chemical and balistic missile programmes .
wasting arsenal on paper iraq still keeps what seems like an impressive military arsenal .
but this arsenal is slowly wasting away .
iraq has not been able to modernise its armed forces , spare parts are scarce , co-ordination is insufficient and pilots have been greatly restricted due to u.s.-imposed no-fly zones .
in addition , the morale of iraqi forces is said to be weak .
large parts of the iraqi forces simply ran away and surrendered during operation desert storm .
hidden resources but what is still unclear is whether iraq has significant biological and chemical weapons to deploy against an invading force .
should the weapons inspectors be allowed back to baghdad , finding out what resources hussein is hiding would be their main objective .
" has iraq attempted to rebuild its atomic arsenal ?
this is the big question " , atomic energy agency spokeswoman melissa flemming said .
" without the possiblity to go everywhere , to look at each building , to interview each person , to look at each document , - without these possibilities we will never be sure whether something is being made in secret " . " we definitely need access " , flemming said .
third time running fears that iraq may pass on its knowledge of chemical or biological warfare to terrorist groups have led to repeated talk of a " regime change " within u.s. ranks .
asked whether u.s. threats against hussein had been the catalyst for the talks , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said that was not what had " propelled " him here .
however , this is the third meeting between the un and iraq to discuss a possible return of arms inspectors to baghdad .

" they have n't said yes yet , " u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said at the close of the vienna meeting .
only a day earlier , annan seemed more optimistic .
he said he hoped for " conclusive decisions " on the return of the arms experts , who left on the eve of a december 1998 bombing raid to punish iraq for blocking their work .
the un wants to see its arms inspectors return to iraq after an absence of more than three years . the international body is demanding the return of the inspectors as a prerequisite for the lifting of sanctions that have been in place for 12 years .
u.s. president george w. bush has repeatedly warned hussein he would face serious consequences if he continued to prevent inspectors from examining whether iraq is continuing to clandestinely develop its prohibited nuclear , biological , chemical and balistic missile programmes .
wasting arsenal on paper iraq still keeps what seems like an impressive military arsenal .
but this arsenal is slowly wasting away .
iraq has not been able to modernise its armed forces , spare parts are scarce , co-ordination is insufficient and pilots have been greatly restricted due to u.s.-imposed no-fly zones .
in addition , the morale of iraqi forces is said to be weak .
large parts of the iraqi forces simply ran away and surrendered during operation desert storm .
hidden resources but what is still unclear is whether iraq has significant biological and chemical weapons to deploy against an invading force .
should the weapons inspectors be allowed back to baghdad , finding out what resources hussein is hiding would be their main objective .
" has iraq attempted to rebuild its atomic arsenal ?
this is the big question " , atomic energy agency spokeswoman melissa flemming said .
" without the possiblity to go everywhere , to look at each building , to interview each person , to look at each document , - without these possibilities we will never be sure whether something is being made in secret " . " we definitely need access " , flemming said .
third time running fears that iraq may pass on its knowledge of chemical or biological warfare to terrorist groups have led to repeated talk of a " regime change " within u.s. ranks .
asked whether u.s. threats against hussein had been the catalyst for the talks , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said that was not what had " propelled " him here .
however , this is the third meeting between the un and iraq to discuss a possible return of arms inspectors to baghdad .
so far , no breakthrough has been achieved on this matter .

" they have n't said yes yet , " u.n. secretary-general kofi annan said at the close of the vienna meeting .
only a day earlier , annan seemed more optimistic .
he said he hoped for " conclusive decisions " on the return of the arms experts , who left on the eve of a december 1998 bombing raid to punish iraq for blocking their work .
the un wants to see its arms inspectors return to iraq after an absence of more than three years . the international body is demanding the return of the inspectors as a prerequisite for the lifting of sanctions that have been in place for 12 years .
u.s. president george w. bush has repeatedly warned hussein he would face serious consequences if he continued to prevent inspectors from examining whether iraq is continuing to clandestinely develop its prohibited nuclear , biological , chemical and balistic missile programmes .
wasting arsenal on paper iraq still keeps what seems like an impressive military arsenal .
but this arsenal is slowly wasting away .
iraq has not been able to modernise its armed forces , spare parts are scarce , co-ordination is insufficient and pilots have been greatly restricted due to u.s.-imposed no-fly zones .
in addition , the morale of iraqi forces is said to be weak .
large parts of the iraqi forces simply ran away and surrendered during operation desert storm .
hidden resources but what is still unclear is whether iraq has significant biological and chemical weapons to deploy against an invading force .
should the weapons inspectors be allowed back to baghdad , finding out what resources hussein is hiding would be their main objective .

an austrian daily pokes holes in the image of the swiss while the german press vents fury at president bush 's america .
a debt-ridden french media giant is described as part of the country 's cultural heritage by a cabinet minister .
and a daily in russia ponders the value of the euro to the country .
what 's happened to the swiss ?
austria 's der standard sees the presumed circumstances of monday 's mid-air collision over southern germany as a blow to switzerland 's reputation . "
the impression is growing among their neighbours that the swiss are far too selfish " der standard " the suspected human and mechanical flaws " at the swiss company managing air traffic in the airspace where the collision occurred , " have shaken trust in the almost proverbial swiss precision " , the paper says .
it believes that last year 's fire in the gotthard road tunnel had already damaged the perception of switzerland abroad .
moreover , it adds , " the impression is growing among their neighbours that the swiss are far too selfish " .
" while refusing to co-operate with the european union on issues of banking confidentiality , " the paper points out , the swiss " expect other european countries to co-operate in keeping away immigrants " .

the long-running experiment in leith came to an end in november following complaints from residents .
the prostitute welfare organisation scotpep said it has seen 11 attacks on women during the six months after the abolition of the scheme - the same number as in the whole of the previous year .
the disclosure came as scottish national party msp margo macdonald unveiled her proposed legislation to make tolerance zones legal . "
clients are taking advantage of the fact that the women are not working collectively together , " ruth morgan thomas scotpep ruth morgan thomas , of scotpep , told bbc scotland that the organisation had seen " a different pattern " of attacks in recent months .
" clients are taking advantage of the fact that the women are not working collectively together , " she said .
" we had one client who came back the same night and attacked a second woman because the women did n't have the ability to communicate any more and warn one another about the attack . "
she said that the women working the streets would continue to do so with or without the zone .
and she added : " we have seen an increase in drug dealers coming into the area , in men coming in to ' mind ' women .
tolerance zones " those are the things which , in other cities , create far greater nuisance than the women themselves in areas where street prostitution occurs . "
scotpep also reported the first instances in two years of prostitutes under the age of 16 working in the city .
ms macdonald 's proposed legislation would make tolerance zones legal , allowing street prostitutes to ply their trade without fear of arrest .
her bill would allow local authorities to set up and police defined areas .
as it is soliciting in public which is illegal , a tolerance zone would no longer be defined as a public place for the purposes of the bill .
however debating time is tight - and it is questionable whether the bill could become law in the lifetime of the current parliament .
police in aberdeen set up a tolerance zone in the harbour area of the city in january .
sited in a mainly industrial and commercial area , it was aimed at protecting prostitutes from violence .
in edinburgh , police had unofficially tolerated the activities of prostitutes in leith since the early 1980s to make it easier for health agencies to regulate the spread of hiv .
local opposition the prostitutes were given strict guidelines , such as when they could congregate and how many people would be permitted in the area .
however , the zone was switched from coburg street to salamander street in august following complaints from residents .
the second site also met local opposition and was abandoned in november - only days after ms macdonald lodged the prostitute tolerance zones -lrb- scotland -rrb- bill .
her proposals were the subject of a consultation period which ended in may .

america is preparing to celebrate its national holiday amid a backdrop of unprecedented security measures .
the white house has encouraged americans to celebrate the independence day holiday on thursday , while remaining aware that security has been tightened nationwide for their protection .
military jets will patrol american skies , while the police and fbi presence will be stepped up around the country .
the announcement follows a warning that terror groups might try to stage attacks to coincide with the holiday .
the us state department said it had " credible " information that terrorists were planning imminent attacks against american targets .
how will you be celebrating independence day ?
are you worried about the warnings of terrorist attacks ?
this talking point is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your comments : i now treasure the 4th of july more than ever before .
jenny , usa i now treasure the 4th of july more than ever before .
i am very proud to be an american and i plan on celebrating to the fullest .
some reactionary backward terrorist group is n't going to frighten me .
jenny , usa i will be celebrating the 4th in san francisco , like i have done for the past four years .
there is always a spectacular fireworks show above the water .
i have to admit that i do have some fear of an attack , but i ca n't let it run my life and ruin this beautiful celebration that my ancestors worked so hard to achieve !
regina , usa normally we have a block cookout with neighbors , see the july 4th parade to support our veterans and my son 's marching band , then we see the fireworks as an orchestra plays at wright patterson afb near dayton , ohio .
however , i think we 'll stay away from wpafb this year because of the terrorist warnings .
justin , usa the terrorists will not win against the great nations of peace and free will .
as a british citizen i have come to respect america for it 's strength and honour as a nation that has gone through so much over the last 10 months .
happy independence day !
god bless england and god bless america !
chris cole , united kingdom if bush is so confident , why does n't he join the celebrations in either new york or dc rob , usa how secure are americans to feel when their president decides to spend independence day not in the nation 's capital , but rather in west virginia , which is home to the security complex built to shelter the both the executive branch and congress during a nuclear war ?
if bush is so confident , why does n't he join the celebrations in either new york or dc , where presumably american confidence needs the most bolstering ?
rob , usa i 've spent the day indoors with the air conditioning on full blast .
i figure if i die of heat exhaustion , the terrorists have won .
jeffrey hall , usa 112 degrees fahrenheit here in vermont yesterday !
we started our fourth of july celebrations early so as to get in as many barbecues and fireworks as possible and they will continue on through friday .
we 'll be off to the lake with burgers & potato salad until about 5 pm , then rush up to the dam to enjoy the music , carnival and fireworks this evening .
no changes here - and no anxiety either .
robin , usa i 'm an american , living and working in england .
i 've invited some of my english pals round to my place tonight to watch the film ' independence day ' as i feel this movie accurately reflects the spirit and courage of my countrymen when under fire .
we 'll be eating fried chicken and ice cream and trousers will become pants for one night only .
we 'll probably watch ' die hard ' as well .
simon , uk this holiday has become a somber moment of reflection for me .
jens dammers , usa in uk as an american citizen now living in the uk i 'll be celebrating my independence from all of the new draconian provisions put in place by the bush adminstration .
i barely recognise the america i once loved so .
this holiday has become a somber moment of reflection for me .
america needs a leader not compromised by scandals , oil , fundamentalists , and hawks .
only then will americans be granted a viable independent nation .
however , i miss all of the friends and bbqs i 'll be missing this year .
take care guys ! ! !
jens dammers , usa / uk i would think that the us is pretty safe on the 4th of july .
it would n't surprise me at all though if its not so safe on the 5th and 6th .
its unlikely that the terrorists will actually chose the most difficult day for a strike .
they are patient , they will probably wait until the security slackens .
vivien cooksley , austria i will be celebrating as i generally do , with friends and a trip to see fireworks .
much to my displeasure , i will not be going to the national mall in washington , d.c. for fireworks this year as i have many times in the past .
not because i 'm worried about terrorists or crowds .
because of the security measures -lrb- security perimeter , bag checks , and so forth -rrb- that will do little to actually protect people from a real threat .
i can not endorse these measures and allow the police and policymakers to think that these sorts of restrictions are acceptable restrictions on our freedoms .
debbie , maryland , usa i celebrated the holiday by not using it as a tortuous statement of arrogance to the rest of the world .
i remembered that i am a human being first , an american second , and that neither was my doing .
i am grateful to be alive in a diverse world in which america is only one of many voices .
robert , american in france we will celebrate as we do other years brenda , usa we will celebrate as we do other years , barbeque and if weather holds out some jet skiing .
but this year there is more pride and much more to be thankful for .
as a nation we have been blessed with a freedom that few countries know .
god bless america and may we always continue to help those less fortunate .
the terrorists can not destroy our resolve and like our british friends , we will survive all acts of terror !
brenda , usa i am not a great lover of american culture and brashness .
but i recognise that without the power and the influence of the united states the world would be a much dangerous place than it already is .
on this your special day i salute my american cousins and wish them all a great and peaceful 4th of july .
neil , england .
if i hear the word " freedom " one more time i think i 'll scream .
what exactly are these freedoms you guys go on and on about ?
can someone in this forum give me an example of something you can do in the us that i couldnt do in say australia , canada or western europe ? -lrb- and i 'm not interested in buying a gun -rrb- steve , switzerland i went to mass this morning ; it was packed .
drove two friends down to natinal airport ; it was empty .
the highways through washington dc have miles of new snow fences , it is in the high 90s f. every grassy area has bumper to bumper parked cars , zillions of volley ball nets and coolers .
ben laden , terrorists , hate filled murderers , have already lost .
america won .
freedom won .
decency won .
r. l. hails sr. , washington d.c. usa attacking the us on this patriotic holiday would only strengthen our resolve robert , usa i 'll take my son to see his first parade .
we 'll bbq and follow it up with fireworks over the harbour .
attacking the us on this patriotic holiday would only strengthen our resolve and determination .
removing political debate by consolidating public opinion would be a costly mistake for the enemy .
god bless america , united we stand !
robert , usa i will observe a day of mourning for the glorious nation that once was .
president bush is transforming america into a paranoid police state by purposefully creating an environment of fear , hate and revenge .
throughout history , all empires have unwittingly destroyed themselves .
america is well on its way .
richard , usa to richard , usa : come on !
the america of the past was certainly no more glorious than present-day america .
and america today , while not perfect , has a lot going for it .
i do not share your fatalistic attitude .
perhaps , rather than mourn , you should get off your chair and do something to change the world you see - that 's the american way .
shane , usa i 'll be at a huge celebration at my dad 's house .

brad , usa this is the kind of occasion that shows the true relationship between britain and the us .
despite the ira trying to murder innocent people we still celebrated our holidays and defied them for years .

enjoy your holiday and show the terrorists that they have n't won a thing .

america is preparing to celebrate its national holiday amid a backdrop of unprecedented security measures .
the white house has encouraged americans to celebrate the independence day holiday on thursday , while remaining aware that security has been tightened nationwide for their protection .
military jets will patrol american skies , while the police and fbi presence will be stepped up around the country .
the announcement follows a warning that terror groups might try to stage attacks to coincide with the holiday .
the us state department said it had " credible " information that terrorists were planning imminent attacks against american targets .
how will you be celebrating independence day ?
are you worried about the warnings of terrorist attacks ?
this talking point is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your comments : " i now treasure the 4th of july more than ever before . "
jenny , usa i now treasure the 4th of july more than ever before .
i am very proud to be an american and i plan on celebrating to the fullest .
some reactionary backward terrorist group is n't going to frighten me .
jenny , usa i will be celebrating the 4th in san francisco , like i have done for the past four years .
there is always a spectacular fireworks show above the water .
i have to admit that i do have some fear of an attack , but i ca n't let it run my life and ruin this beautiful celebration that my ancestors worked so hard to achieve !
regina , usa normally we have a block cookout with neighbors , see the july 4th parade to support our veterans and my son 's marching band , then we see the fireworks as an orchestra plays at wright patterson afb near dayton , ohio .
however , i think we 'll stay away from wpafb this year because of the terrorist warnings .
justin , usa the terrorists will not win against the great nations of peace and free will .
as a british citizen i have come to respect america for it 's strength and honour as a nation that has gone through so much over the last 10 months .
happy independence day !
god bless england and god bless america !
chris cole , united kingdom " if bush is so confident , why does n't he join the celebrations in either new york or dc " rob , usa how secure are americans to feel when their president decides to spend independence day not in the nation 's capital , but rather in west virginia , which is home to the security complex built to shelter the both the executive branch and congress during a nuclear war ?
if bush is so confident , why does n't he join the celebrations in either new york or dc , where presumably american confidence needs the most bolstering ?
rob , usa i 've spent the day indoors with the air conditioning on full blast .
i figure if i die of heat exhaustion , the terrorists have won .
jeffrey hall , usa 112 degrees fahrenheit here in vermont yesterday !
we started our fourth of july celebrations early so as to get in as many barbecues and fireworks as possible and they will continue on through friday .
we 'll be off to the lake with burgers & potato salad until about 5 pm , then rush up to the dam to enjoy the music , carnival and fireworks this evening .
no changes here - and no anxiety either .
robin , usa i 'm an american , living and working in england .
i 've invited some of my english pals round to my place tonight to watch the film ' independence day ' as i feel this movie accurately reflects the spirit and courage of my countrymen when under fire .
we 'll be eating fried chicken and ice cream and trousers will become pants for one night only .
we 'll probably watch ' die hard ' as well .
simon , uk " this holiday has become a somber moment of reflection for me . "
jens dammers , usa in uk as an american citizen now living in the uk i 'll be celebrating my independence from all of the new draconian provisions put in place by the bush adminstration .
i barely recognise the america i once loved so .
this holiday has become a somber moment of reflection for me .
america needs a leader not compromised by scandals , oil , fundamentalists , and hawks .
only then will americans be granted a viable independent nation .
however , i miss all of the friends and bbqs i 'll be missing this year .
take care guys ! ! !
jens dammers , usa / uk i would think that the us is pretty safe on the 4th of july .
it would n't surprise me at all though if its not so safe on the 5th and 6th .
its unlikely that the terrorists will actually chose the most difficult day for a strike .
they are patient , they will probably wait until the security slackens .
vivien cooksley , austria i will be celebrating as i generally do , with friends and a trip to see fireworks .
much to my displeasure , i will not be going to the national mall in washington , d.c. for fireworks this year as i have many times in the past .
not because i 'm worried about terrorists or crowds .
because of the security measures -lrb- security perimeter , bag checks , and so forth -rrb- that will do little to actually protect people from a real threat .
i can not endorse these measures and allow the police and policymakers to think that these sorts of restrictions are acceptable restrictions on our freedoms .
debbie , maryland , usa i celebrated the holiday by not using it as a tortuous statement of arrogance to the rest of the world .
i remembered that i am a human being first , an american second , and that neither was my doing .
i am grateful to be alive in a diverse world in which america is only one of many voices .
robert , american in france " we will celebrate as we do other years " brenda , usa we will celebrate as we do other years , barbeque and if weather holds out some jet skiing .
but this year there is more pride and much more to be thankful for .
as a nation we have been blessed with a freedom that few countries know .
god bless america and may we always continue to help those less fortunate .
the terrorists can not destroy our resolve and like our british friends , we will survive all acts of terror !
brenda , usa i am not a great lover of american culture and brashness .
but i recognise that without the power and the influence of the united states the world would be a much dangerous place than it already is .
on this your special day i salute my american cousins and wish them all a great and peaceful 4th of july .
neil , england .
if i hear the word " freedom " one more time i think i 'll scream .
what exactly are these freedoms you guys go on and on about ?
can someone in this forum give me an example of something you can do in the us that i couldnt do in say australia , canada or western europe ? -lrb- and i 'm not interested in buying a gun -rrb- steve , switzerland i went to mass this morning ; it was packed .
drove two friends down to natinal airport ; it was empty .
the highways through washington dc have miles of new snow fences , it is in the high 90s f. every grassy area has bumper to bumper parked cars , zillions of volley ball nets and coolers .
ben laden , terrorists , hate filled murderers , have already lost .
america won .
freedom won .
decency won .
r. l. hails sr. , washington d.c. usa " attacking the us on this patriotic holiday would only strengthen our resolve " robert , usa i 'll take my son to see his first parade .
we 'll bbq and follow it up with fireworks over the harbour .
attacking the us on this patriotic holiday would only strengthen our resolve and determination .
removing political debate by consolidating public opinion would be a costly mistake for the enemy .
god bless america , united we stand !
robert , usa i will observe a day of mourning for the glorious nation that once was .
president bush is transforming america into a paranoid police state by purposefully creating an environment of fear , hate and revenge .
throughout history , all empires have unwittingly destroyed themselves .
america is well on its way .
richard , usa to richard , usa : come on !
the america of the past was certainly no more glorious than present-day america .
and america today , while not perfect , has a lot going for it .
i do not share your fatalistic attitude .
perhaps , rather than mourn , you should get off your chair and do something to change the world you see - that 's the american way .
shane , usa i 'll be at a huge celebration at my dad 's house .
let the terrorist dimwits try something , they will be hunted down and punished .
they are an abomination to all of humanity .
i do n't regret to inform them that they will not be spoiling any parties here in the us , they only make us celebrate our freedom and democracy even more .

the deputy prime minister said he would " like to see a step up " in the number of affordable homes being built .

local councillors will examine the pros and cons of the pilot project in wrexham during a question and answer session on friday . "
this has given the opportunity for the young person to take responsibility for the offence they have committed " martyn jones , mp for clwyd south it follows the introduction of a youth referral panel - which consists of two people from the locality and a member of the youth offending team .
under the scheme panel listen to the crimes committed by the youngster before drawing up an individual contract which the young offender must follow .
wrexham is one of 11 areas across the uk piloting the new scheme .
amy newell , of wrexham youth offending service , said councillors from all over the borough are attending the forum .
" there is different issues in different wards in the borough .
there are different needs .
we are giving them a chance to voice their concerns on how we deal with it , " she said .
the scheme which was introduced in april 2002 works by giving referral orders for 10 to 17-year-olds who plead guilty on a first time conviction .
once an order is given , the youngster faces a youth offender panel .
the panel consists of two volunteers recruited directly from the local community , alongside one member of the youth offending team volunteers on the wrexham panel were recruited via posters in the local community , and have each undergone three months training .
the panel decides on an appropriate punishment and a tailor-made contract is drawn up , which the youngster signs .

management at the computer plant in erskine said the job losses were a result of its merger with hewlett packard earlier this year .
the scottish national party 's economy spokesman andrew wilson said it was another sign of the decline in the manufacturing sector which first minister jack mcconnell 's scottish executive has no power to reverse .

the jobs to be shed comprise 450 full-time and 180 part-time posts .
the company announced a global restructuring programme at the time of the merger to reduce its combined worldwide workforce of 150,000 by 15,000 within its first 18 months of operation .
it said the implementation of any workforce reduction would be subject to prior consultation , starting on friday .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- do you trust your computer ?
bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point friday , 5 july , 2002 , 07:54 gmt 08:54 uk do you trust your computer ?
computer consultant bill thompson wonders whether microsoft plans to make your computer more secure are the way forward .
i do n't trust my computer .
i think this is reasonable .
every day it lets nasty viruses and unwanted e-mails into my life .
it will run any program it is given , even ones that will trash my hard disk or reveal my personal secrets .
and it often refuses to do what i want or simply stops working . "
the price may be that these same companies get a lot more control over how we actually use them " not one of the one billion computers that have been made can be trusted , because the way they are designed means that the central processor will carry out whatever instructions it is given , with no way of telling whether they are legitimate or not .
the result is our current security nightmare , with security holes announced every week and " patches " - program updates - needed almost every day .
this may be about to change .
in the next couple of years , thanks to work by companies like intel and microsoft , we could have computers we can really trust .
but the price may be that these same companies get a lot more control over how we actually use them .
click here to tell us what you think bill should write about we have to decide now , before it is too late , what choices we are going to make .
and many of the decisions will be political , not technological .
a question of trust it all started two years ago when chip manufacturer intel , along with ibm , microsoft and others , formed the trusted computing platform alliance -lrb- tcpa -rrb- to think up a way of building secure computers .
their standard was published last year , based around a special piece of hardware which could guarantee security .
this would initially be a separate chip but could later form part of the processor itself .
the security chip acts as a supervisor for the computer .
when you turn on a secure pc , the security chip looks to see what programs are being loaded , and will only let you run stuff that has been approved .
the approval process would work by giving each program a special " digital fingerprint " and checking to see whether the fingerprint matched the one stored by the chip .
the system is obviously designed for computers that are connected to the internet , and so would rely on having an online database of fingerprints which the security chip could access .
so when a new program was released - say a new web browser - it would be checked and certified and its fingerprint would be added to the database .
going public until recently the tcpa was working away in the background .
but last week , microsoft revealed details about a new project it is working on dubbed palladium , named after the greek goddess pallas athena , a symbol of protection .
palladium seems , from the limited technical details available , to be microsoft 's way of making a trusted version of windows , using the tcpa specification and special hardware from intel and amd , another major chip manufacturer .
it would use an authorisation process developed , managed and controlled by microsoft - the implications of which worry a lot of people . "
this is not just about users trusting their pcs not to run viruses .
it is also about copyright owners not trusting the users . "
putting these concerns aside , the idea of a secure computer is appealing .
with something like palladium the problem of spam goes away .
all i need is an e-mail program that only accepts properly signed messages and rejects everything else .
then my friends and colleagues can reach me , and legitimate business can send me marketing information , but the fraudsters and get-rich-quick merchants can not get through .
it also removes the need for virus protection .
if a virus changes a program to add its own functions then that will break the digital seal , and my trusted pc will not run it .
however , this is not just about users trusting their pcs not to run viruses .
it is also about copyright owners not trusting the users and trying to build controls into the computers themselves .
digital rights a trusted pc would not make a copy of a dvd or an audio file .
it would report any copyright violations back to the rights holder .
it would rigorously enforce licensing conditions , even if those conditions take away fair use rights which copyright law would grant .
this is called digital rights management , and it applies to films , music and , of course , to software .
as a writer i rely on copyright law to ensure that my publishers pay me for my work .
i do not give my writing away , because i need to eat .
but i am concerned that technical means of enforcing copyright are extending the law on the quiet , taking away rights that i value as a consumer - the right to quote other people 's words , or to make copies for personal use .
computer spy ?
i am also concerned about having a company in control of the system which determines what files and programs can run on my computer .
suppose microsoft decide that someone else 's e-mail program is too similar to outlook and sues them .
what is to stop them disabling that program on every trusted pc during the court case ?
suppose that worldcom 's financial records found their way on to the net and the company got an injunction preventing further publication ?
what is to stop microsoft disabling the ability to read this document on a trusted pc ?
there are many more issues raised by this technology .
however , despite the issues and the frightening predictions of friends and colleagues in the technical press , i have a confession to make .
i think microsoft is doing the right thing , and i think palladium , or something like it , is what we need if we are going to make the most of the internet and the wired society .
we need to trust our computers , and this is a way to achieve this .
the key thing is not the technology but how it is regulated , licensed and controlled .
i do not want to see microsoft or any other company decide how trusted pcs work .
that is the proper task of democratically-elected governments .
with trusted computers we have reached the point where digital technology needs to be regulated , just as governments decided last century that car use needed to be controlled .
many will see this as a bad thing .
i do n't agree .
i think it is a sign of how far the network has come .
have your say click here to return is there a technology issue that gets you going ?
tell us what you would like bill to write about in his regular column .
bill picks up one some critical points .
one that leaving security in the hands of one private company can not be the way forward .
the other is that drm infringes your fair use rights that are upheld in the copyright laws .
media companies need to come up with a way of delivering their products in a digital format which still ensures the royalties get paid .
sanjay samani , uk i 'm writing this message on my computer .
this phrase is pretty important , because it 's my machine that i do my work in .
it 's my workspace .
it 's my tool , and my property .
as a consumer , i may make the choice between buying every piece of software microsoft has to offer , or not having any contact with them at all .
palladium restricts this choice by threatening to fence off all non-microsoft attached users from the rest of the world .
dan glegg , uk a computer is , by definition , a user programmable device .
palladium will shut down the capability of a user to create his / her own programs .
everything " useful " which is claimed for palladium can already be done - without breaking the computer as a general-purpose user-programmable device .
brian beesley , uk it 's a nice idea , and i agree if it were to be implemented then it should be run by the government , and independently regulated .
but , we should have legislation now to enshrine the rights of the common man on the internet .
just because it is easier to transfer information on the internet it should not be restricted more .
from an academic standing point i currently write short scripts and run them .
i would dread to think how much it would cost if for every little program i write i have to get to get rights to a signature .
richard , uk you 're assuming that palladium / tcpa will be managed properly by the forces that brought them into play .
make no mistake , something as complex as palladium / tcpa will need to be managed no matter how clever the underlying code might be .
the government are incapable of such management , they 've proven that on their own already so who else ?
the tcpa group itself ?
what about free software and refurbished pc 's .
a true and valid hope for those people struggling to improve their skills and knowledge in it -lrb- both in this country and the more impoverished third world countries -rrb- .
suddenly they 're faced with a " pay up or suffer " attitude .
you think there 's a digital divide now ?
wait until palladium kicks in .
there 'll only be the haves and the have-nots and never the twain shall meet .
bruce beardall , uk there is no need to add a virus chip to computers .
change your application software to linux and you will be spam and virus-free .
peter , united kingdom the problem of security arises from the fact that microsoft have a monopoly of the operating system market and the fact the average user does not know how a pc works .
if the average pc user was capable enough then he / she could choose to use another operating system such as linux which the user themselves could set up their personal security settings .
i have a huge problem with a company like microsoft telling me what software is legitimate to run on my pc or not .
mark lowman , england what happens to people who develop and distribute their own programs ?
if i use one of microsoft 's own languages like visual basic to create a program which i distribute on the web then palladium would prevent it running on any computer , even my own , as it would n't have certification .
or else certification would be available at a price , which would yet again favour large software developers over small ones .
would palladium spell the end of shareware and freeware , or is this the objective in the first place ?
derek , uk it is a fine line between trusting your pc and not becoming frustrated with your pc .
is this going to cost me more ?
yes , neither microsoft or any other pc is going to work on providing a system that does not cost the customer more .
and is this going to frustrate me ?
yes , this system will in some way require the user to agree to various computer systems being run on the pc whether as they come across them or setting up the system in the first place .
annwyl , london , uk i do trust my computer : it only does what it is told to do , and the only person who controls it is myself .
i want to stay it that way and at any rate bill gates is the last person i would let decide what i can run on my computer .

computer consultant bill thompson wonders whether microsoft plans to make your computer more secure are the way forward .
i do n't trust my computer .
i think this is reasonable .
every day it lets nasty viruses and unwanted e-mails into my life .
it will run any program it is given , even ones that will trash my hard disk or reveal my personal secrets .
and it often refuses to do what i want or simply stops working .
the price may be that these same companies get a lot more control over how we actually use them not one of the one billion computers that have been made can be trusted , because the way they are designed means that the central processor will carry out whatever instructions it is given , with no way of telling whether they are legitimate or not .
the result is our current security nightmare , with security holes announced every week and " patches " - program updates - needed almost every day .
this may be about to change .
in the next couple of years , thanks to work by companies like intel and microsoft , we could have computers we can really trust .
but the price may be that these same companies get a lot more control over how we actually use them .
click here to tell us what you think bill should write about we have to decide now , before it is too late , what choices we are going to make .
and many of the decisions will be political , not technological .
a question of trust it all started two years ago when chip manufacturer intel , along with ibm , microsoft and others , formed the trusted computing platform alliance -lrb- tcpa -rrb- to think up a way of building secure computers .
how much do you trust your computer ?
their standard was published last year , based around a special piece of hardware which could guarantee security .
this would initially be a separate chip but could later form part of the processor itself .
the security chip acts as a supervisor for the computer .
when you turn on a secure pc , the security chip looks to see what programs are being loaded , and will only let you run stuff that has been approved .
the approval process would work by giving each program a special " digital fingerprint " and checking to see whether the fingerprint matched the one stored by the chip .
the system is obviously designed for computers that are connected to the internet , and so would rely on having an online database of fingerprints which the security chip could access .
so when a new program was released - say a new web browser - it would be checked and certified and its fingerprint would be added to the database .
going public until recently the tcpa was working away in the background .
but last week , microsoft revealed details about a new project it is working on dubbed palladium , named after the greek goddess pallas athena , a symbol of protection .
palladium seems , from the limited technical details available , to be microsoft 's way of making a trusted version of windows , using the tcpa specification and special hardware from intel and amd , another major chip manufacturer .
it would use an authorisation process developed , managed and controlled by microsoft - the implications of which worry a lot of people .
this is not just about users trusting their pcs not to run viruses .
it is also about copyright owners not trusting the users .
putting these concerns aside , the idea of a secure computer is appealing .
with something like palladium the problem of spam goes away .
all i need is an e-mail program that only accepts properly signed messages and rejects everything else .
then my friends and colleagues can reach me , and legitimate business can send me marketing information , but the fraudsters and get-rich-quick merchants can not get through .
it also removes the need for virus protection .
if a virus changes a program to add its own functions then that will break the digital seal , and my trusted pc will not run it .
however , this is not just about users trusting their pcs not to run viruses .
it is also about copyright owners not trusting the users and trying to build controls into the computers themselves .
digital rights a trusted pc would not make a copy of a dvd or an audio file .
it would report any copyright violations back to the rights holder .
it would rigorously enforce licensing conditions , even if those conditions take away fair use rights which copyright law would grant .
system could stop cd-copying this is called digital rights management , and it applies to films , music and , of course , to software .
as a writer i rely on copyright law to ensure that my publishers pay me for my work .
i do not give my writing away , because i need to eat .
but i am concerned that technical means of enforcing copyright are extending the law on the quiet , taking away rights that i value as a consumer - the right to quote other people 's words , or to make copies for personal use .
computer spy ?
i am also concerned about having a company in control of the system which determines what files and programs can run on my computer .
suppose microsoft decide that someone else 's e-mail program is too similar to outlook and sues them .
what is to stop them disabling that program on every trusted pc during the court case ?
suppose that worldcom 's financial records found their way on to the net and the company got an injunction preventing further publication ?
what is to stop microsoft disabling the ability to read this document on a trusted pc ?
there are many more issues raised by this technology .
however , despite the issues and the frightening predictions of friends and colleagues in the technical press , i have a confession to make .
i think microsoft is doing the right thing , and i think palladium , or something like it , is what we need if we are going to make the most of the internet and the wired society .
we need to trust our computers , and this is a way to achieve this .
the key thing is not the technology but how it is regulated , licensed and controlled .
i do not want to see microsoft or any other company decide how trusted pcs work .
that is the proper task of democratically-elected governments .
with trusted computers we have reached the point where digital technology needs to be regulated , just as governments decided last century that car use needed to be controlled .
many will see this as a bad thing .
i do n't agree .
i think it is a sign of how far the network has come .
click here to return is there a technology issue that gets you going ?
tell us what you would like bill to write about in his regular column .
bill picks up one some critical points .
one that leaving security in the hands of one private company can not be the way forward .
the other is that drm infringes your fair use rights that are upheld in the copyright laws .
media companies need to come up with a way of delivering their products in a digital format which still ensures the royalties get paid .
sanjay samani , uk i 'm writing this message on my computer .
this phrase is pretty important , because it 's my machine that i do my work in .
it 's my workspace .
it 's my tool , and my property .
as a consumer , i may make the choice between buying every piece of software microsoft has to offer , or not having any contact with them at all .
palladium restricts this choice by threatening to fence off all non-microsoft attached users from the rest of the world .
dan glegg , uk a computer is , by definition , a user programmable device .
palladium will shut down the capability of a user to create his / her own programs .
everything " useful " which is claimed for palladium can already be done - without breaking the computer as a general-purpose user-programmable device .
brian beesley , uk it 's a nice idea , and i agree if it were to be implemented then it should be run by the government , and independently regulated .
but , we should have legislation now to enshrine the rights of the common man on the internet .
just because it is easier to transfer information on the internet it should not be restricted more .
from an academic standing point i currently write short scripts and run them .
i would dread to think how much it would cost if for every little program i write i have to get to get rights to a signature .
richard , uk you 're assuming that palladium / tcpa will be managed properly by the forces that brought them into play .
make no mistake , something as complex as palladium / tcpa will need to be managed no matter how clever the underlying code might be .
the government are incapable of such management , they 've proven that on their own already so who else ?
the tcpa group itself ?
what about free software and refurbished pc 's .
a true and valid hope for those people struggling to improve their skills and knowledge in it -lrb- both in this country and the more impoverished third world countries -rrb- .
suddenly they 're faced with a " pay up or suffer " attitude .
you think there 's a digital divide now ?
wait until palladium kicks in .
there 'll only be the haves and the have-nots and never the twain shall meet .
bruce beardall , uk there is no need to add a virus chip to computers .
change your application software to linux and you will be spam and virus-free .
peter , united kingdom the problem of security arises from the fact that microsoft have a monopoly of the operating system market and the fact the average user does not know how a pc works .
if the average pc user was capable enough then he / she could choose to use another operating system such as linux which the user themselves could set up their personal security settings .
i have a huge problem with a company like microsoft telling me what software is legitimate to run on my pc or not .
mark lowman , england what happens to people who develop and distribute their own programs ?
if i use one of microsoft 's own languages like visual basic to create a program which i distribute on the web then palladium would prevent it running on any computer , even my own , as it would n't have certification .
or else certification would be available at a price , which would yet again favour large software developers over small ones .
would palladium spell the end of shareware and freeware , or is this the objective in the first place ?
derek , uk it is a fine line between trusting your pc and not becoming frustrated with your pc .
is this going to cost me more ?
yes , neither microsoft or any other pc is going to work on providing a system that does not cost the customer more .
and is this going to frustrate me ?
yes , this system will in some way require the user to agree to various computer systems being run on the pc whether as they come across them or setting up the system in the first place .
annwyl , london , uk i do trust my computer : it only does what it is told to do , and the only person who controls it is myself .
i want to stay it that way and at any rate bill gates is the last person i would let decide what i can run on my computer .

he and his wife called the police , but the snake slithered away .
the family thought the snake had escaped down the squatting toilet , which they barricaded with a wooden washing board weighed down with a bucket of water .
" it was very inconvenient , " their daughter , 28-year-old tan cheng-peng , told the newspaper .
" when we had no choice but to use the toilet , we would use it quickly and keep an eye out for the snake . "
the snake appeared to have vanished , until mr tan 's wife chua went to the toilet on thursday morning and was confronted by a black mass inside .

the capacity audience of 5,000 was evacuated after smoke was seen as bennett was singing one of his biggest hits , i left my heart in san francisco .
" i knew i was hot , but not that hot , " the star joked from the stage after informing the crowd that there was a fire .
the small blaze was started by a burnt-out motor , the venue said , and bennett was due to return to play the second of his two shows there on friday .
" we understand how disappointed the audience were , but the safety of the public is our paramount concern , " a spokesman for the prestigious venue said .
" as it turned out , the public were never at risk , but we can not take chances . "
the 75-year-old crooner was " very disappointed " after refurning to his hotel when the show was abandoned .
" he did n't want his audience to be disappointed , but his main concern was obviously for their safety , " his spokeswoman said .
one fan , keith webb , a retired businessman from gerrards cross , buckinghamshire , who was in a box in the venue , said : " it was all quite orderly , there were no signs of panic or people rushing to leave quickly .
" downstairs staff said the show had been cancelled , but no one mentioned anything about refunds . "
george walpole , 37 , travelled from dublin to london to see the show , and said : " we got held up in traffic and missed the start , and just as we got here , hundreds of people were pouring out of the building .
" we paid £ 37 for the ticket and we want a refund . "
bennett , considered to have one of the best voices of any living male singers , is due to finish his short trip to the uk with a show at liverpool king 's dock on sunday , 7 july .
