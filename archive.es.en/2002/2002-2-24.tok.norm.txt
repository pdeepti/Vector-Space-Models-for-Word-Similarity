the once regal room survived both the second world war and the division of berlin . the emperor 's ballroom , buried for long in the ruins of the venerable hotel grand esplanade is back in the spotlight .
it will once again play host to high society of the german capital as it throws open its doors as a high-end restaurant in a neo-rococo look . a gala reception , exquisite delicacies and prominent guests such as catherine deneuve will mark the opening .
it was in this feudal ambience that germany 's last emperor , wilhelm ii used to dine .
former heart of berlin life in true berlin style , old and spanking new aspects of the city come face to face .
renovated at a cost of 25 million euro , the ballroom of the legendary hotel esplanade makes a stately appearance amid the modern architecture of the sony center .
the hotel was the heart of social life in the berlin of the 19th century .
wilhelm ii , germany 's last emperor frequented the place and is said to have spent many evenings there with fellow male contemporaries .
one can imagine the scene right out of a novel : fat-bellied men in frock coats sitting between gold leaves and precious stucco works in champagne-coloured tones and conversing over a glass of good wine and a fat cigar .
perhaps even having heated political discussions .
spectacular restoration during the second world war , the potsdamer platz was reduced to ashes .
all that remained was a burnt-out shell of a building and ruins of the hotel esplanade .
yet the emperor 's ballroom and the breakfast room incredibly managed to survive the destruction along with a neighbouring silver hall and a palm-tree courtyard .
in the 1950s the two rooms were salvaged from the walls , renovated painstakingly and restored to their former glory .
the six-year restoration of the emperor 's ballroom was especially spectacular .
with the use of state-of-the-art technology a 1300 ton heavy ballroom was heaved on to air-filled cushions and moved 75 metres to one side to make way for a street .
the residents of berlin showed immense interest in the project .
when japanese company sony bought much of potsdamer platz , it decided to leave untouched the space where the emperor 's ballroom had stood .
it integrated the other old rooms of the hotel esplanade into a hyper-modern building , which was then hung on a steel bridge , leaving a few millimetres of space between the old and the new buildings .
wilhelm ii expected since last year the opulent breakfast room of the hotel esplanade behind the glass facades of the new building is bathed in shimmering light reflecting off the glass . today the room is a chic bar .
manager gerhard lengauer waited for almost a year longer than planned before he decided to open the other rooms .
the emperor 's ballroom will offer exquisite gourmet food at noon and in the evening .
the room which has been brought under the monument protection and preservation act , can also be booked for events and meetings .
of course the first guests were the stars from the recently-concluded berlin film festival , who came for some intimate meals in the royal surroundings . but even the emperor himself has personally announced that he will be coming for the opening .
an actor dressed as " wilhelm ii " will hold court on the potsdamer platz . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic picture of the day dw-tv europe live journal - with the week we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the observer newspaper says mr blair will travel to washington in six weeks ' time for a specially-convened summit on the issue .
it says mr blair will support action against saddam hussein if the iraqi leader continues to ignore demands that he destroy his weapons of mass destruction .
downing street refused to discuss mr blair 's travel plans but said britain shared us concerns about iraq 's development of such weapons .
" the meeting will be to finalise phase two of the war against terrorism , " the observer quoted a senior official as saying .
" action against iraq will be at the top of the agenda . "
the newspaper said the uk government was planning to publish evidence detailing iraq 's nuclear capabilities to quell any criticism from its backbenches and to reassure the public .
the document is expected to reveal that saddam hussein is attempting to amass crude nuclear capabilities , as well as possibly biological and chemical devices .
the downing street source told the paper that it was a " public persuasion " issue that was necessary to maintain support for military action against iraq .
a downing street spokesman told the afp news agency : " we do share the united states ' concern about iraq 's funding of terrorism and development of weapons of mass destruction .
alliance ' strong ' " we will consult with all of our allies including the us on the second phase .
we remain fully committed to the campaign on terrorism . "
french prime minister lionel jospin - who has previously warned the us against a " fixation " with terrorism - said he had discussed iraq and the us with mr blair and german chancellor gerhard schroeder on saturday .
the three leaders had talked at the progressive government meeting in stockholm , sweden .
" we express the wish that they be with us , that we cooperate with them , " mr jospin said .
downing street was unable to give details of that discussion , but mr blair stressed that the coalition remained solid .
" the alliance with the united states is strong , it will remain strong , " he said .
" we will deal with issues together . "
' axis of evil ' mr blair said : " the americans are absolutely right to emphasise the continuing importance of the war against terrorism and continuing the elimination of weapons of mass destruction . "
mr bush has demanded that saddam hussein allow checks by un weapons inspectors , who left baghdad in 1998 ahead of a us-led bombing campaign .
last month he accused iraq along with iran and north korea of making up a dangerous " axis of evil " .
his administration is reported to have decided to force a change of regime in baghdad .
saddam hussein has accused the us of bullying , and said his country would stand firm against attempts to topple his regime .

woody allen was once asked how he would most like to be reincarnated .
he replied : " as warren beatty 's fingertips . "
beatty in brief 1937 : born 30 march 1961 : big break with splendour in the grass 1967 : produced and starred in bonnie and clyde 1981 : best director for reds 1987 : record flop with ishtar 1992 : became a father beatty has notoriously had relationships with a legion of his leading ladies including natalie wood , joan collins , leslie caron , julie christie , diane keaton , isabelle adjani and madonna .
elizabeth taylor once said : " out of 10 , i 'd give him 15 . "
so it was something of a surprise when he finally tied the knot with hollywood actress annette bening in 1991 , who is about to have their fourth child .
but it will be for his services to film and not to women that warren beatty will receive a prestigious fellowship from the british academy of film and television arts .
the award will draw welcome attention , particularly from the younger generation of film-goers , to beatty 's cinematic achievements .
beatty followed his sister , shirley maclaine , into the movie business and exploded on to the big screen in 1961 in elia kazan 's splendour in the grass .
his portrayal of a handsome rebel challenging social taboos with natalie wood made a huge impression on teenage audiences .
by 1967 he was both star and producer in the highly successful bonnie and clyde for which he won an oscar nomination .
increasingly , his name was appearing in the credits for work behind the camera .
as the gigolo hairdresser in shampoo , he was also co-writer and producer .
the film attacked the immorality of the nixon years and an important element of warren beatty 's career has been his devotion to the political cause .
he has been active in democratic politics since the kennedy years .
when the academy president , robert rehme , praised beatty 's " courage in producing pictures that many other producers might consider too dangerous " , he undoubtedly had in mind - above all - his 1981 film reds in which he portrayed the us communist john reed .
at a time when even " liberal " was becoming a dirty word in american politics , reds was a brave feat which mixed melodrama with interviews with real people .
he was nominated as best writer , producer , actor and director , both for reds and his previous film heaven can wait - an achievement shared only by orson welles for citizen kane .
but it has not all been plain sailing for beatty .
his 1987 comedy ishtar , in which he sang his way through 26 songs with co-star dustin hoffman , was a $ 40m -lrb- £ 25m -rrb- flop .
he redeemed himself in the eyes of the hollywood accountants with dick tracy opposite madonna - allegedly the only leading lady to dump him - and with bugsy , where he met annette bening .
that kind of success helped him persuade rupert murdoch to finance bulworth , his 1998 film devoted to denouncing the corrupting influence of money in us politics .
off-screen beatty even toyed last year with the idea of running for the presidency himself .
according to friends , he was motivated by his conviction that important issues like universal medical insurance , and the exploitation of workers were not receiving enough public attention .
beatty is a notoriously demanding film-maker , well-known for his multi-take perfectionism .
this may explain why he has spent almost a decade working on a film about that doyenne of self-indulgence , howard hughes .
his latest completed movie , town and country , with old flame diane keaton and andie macdowell , nearly doubled its original budget , only to be ridiculed by critics on release .
yet , beatty has earned the respect of many hollywood executives who have , over the years , come to admire his passion , intelligence and charm .
