the british government is satisfied that its military presence in the country can be reduced now that peaceful elections have taken place .
over the past fortnight , the troops have been withdrawing from operations .
the president of sierra leone , ahmad tejan kabbah casts his vote they leave behind more than 100 british officers who will remain in the country to train the sierra leone army .
the departure of some 200 troops , along with their support ship , sir geraint , will certainly cause concern amongst ordinary sierra leonians .
in itself , the ship 's presence in freetown harbour has been a symbol of british intervention in sierra leone , which , in conjunction with a huge united nations peacekeeping force , proved crucial in ending the civil war .
a british army presence here is seen by many as a guarantee of continued security .
new government understandably , captain jonathan huxley of the sir geraint is keen to dampen down the concern .
he is eager to point out that britain is not totally withdrawing from sierra leone - it is merely reducing its military presence because , he says , it is no longer needed .
peace was declared in january this year , and since then , sierra leone has held elections , and formed a new government .
click here to read an interview with sierra leone 's new president the much-improved security situation now means that the british soldiers who will continue to train the sierra leone army no longer need protection .
consequently , the company of british ghurkhas who were providing that protection have just left and a logistics support ship will leave on sunday .
but britain will undoubtedly maintain a strong interest in sierra leone , not least because its military intervention here two years ago can be lauded as one of britain 's greatest foreign policy successes in recent years . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's tom mckinley " over 100 british officers will remain to train the sierra leone army " see also : 24 jul 02 -pipe- africa quality of life : sierra leone versus norway 16 jan 02 -pipe- africa leone war crimes tribunal set up 10 jul 02 -pipe- africa sankoh murder trial delay 19 jan 02 -pipe- africa sierra leone : memories of war 20 may 02 -pipe- africa sierra leone 's kabbah urges unity 20 may 02 -pipe- africa sierra leone 's next steps 25 jun 02 -pipe- country profiles country profile : sierra leone internet links : bbc network africa un mission in sierra leone bbc focus on africa sierra leone web the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top africa stories now : ebola outbreak confirmed in congo malawi minister reveals aids trauma kenyan president opens parliament dr congo rebels go on trial nigerian id scheme kicks off tunisian internet crackdown wild pigs threaten somali peace talks anti-french protests in ivory coast links to more africa stories are at the foot of the page .

the participation front , the largest faction in the reform coalition which dominates the iranian parliament , said that if it withdraws from official politics , the islamic regime would be deprived of its legitimacy and credibility .
having given up hope of exerting military or economic pressure , the enemy is trying to drive a wedge betwween the system and the public ayatollah ali khamenei the reformists have won roughly 70 % of the votes in all elections held since 1997 , when president mohammad khatami won a surprise landslide victory over the establishment candidate in a presidential poll .
if they withdrew from parliament it would be paralysed , precipitating a major constitutional crisis .
despite their control of both the presidency and parliament , the reformists have made little headway against hard-line conservatives who control key institutions and have largely managed to block political change .
the warning comes at a time when reformists are deeply frustrated at their failure to implement the policies they were massively elected to enact .
speaking at a news conference to launch the participation front 's annual statement , its leader , mohammed reza khatami , who is the president 's brother , said the current situation was extremely unstable .
the rift between the public and its rulers , he said , was gradually being transferred to within the system .
three ways he went on to say that there were only three options : the overthrow of the regime , dictatorship , or reform .
president khatami is a figurehead for reformists the first two , said mr khatami , were unacceptable and unworkable , but if reforms continued to be blocked by what he called the " power hungry " , the reformists would have no choice but to leave the political system .
he said that this would deprive the iranian regime of the popular legitimacy and credibility the reformists had conferred on it by winning a massive vote from the people .
" our continued participation in power and in the state is conditional on the realisation of the demands and rights of people , " mr khatami said .
" otherwise we will reach the point of decision , and continue our activities from outside the structure , leaving a power which lacks a sufficient base of legitimacy . "
mr khatami said that the " dual authority " which had arisen within the system had paralysed the state and was also crippling its foreign policy .
he said iran 's relations with the united states were of enormous importance , and that iran should follow its national interest and defuse its crisis with washington .
religious rule all of this was directly in contradiction to everything the country 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei had to say in a speech on saturday to officials in charge of friday prayers .
the americans , he said , were out to destroy the islamic republic .
" having given up hope of exerting military or economic pressure , the enemy is trying to drive a wedge betwween the system and the public , using a propaganda war to make people disillusioned in the islamic system , " he said .
the ayatollah condemned those who saw " capitulating to american bullying " as some sort of " opportunity " , and he warned that guided by god , he would use his powers to intervene if any of the three constitutional powers in iran - the government , the judiciary or the parliament - tried to divert the system from what he called " its true path " .
president khatami has several times said he too would leave office if he concluded that the reform process had become immovably blocked .
but he has remained silent on many of the contentious issues of the day , and is the subject of mounting pressure from within the reform movement to be more assertive or stand down .
the contradiction is clear , between the hardliners who believe power and authority come from god , and the frustrated reformists who believe it comes from the people .
the contradiction is becoming increasingly stark and seems to be coming gradually to a head .

an influential committee of mps and peers has expressed fears in its report on the draft communications bill that british television could be swamped by cheap american programming .
the government 's bill - due for publication on wednesday - intends to relax media ownership rules surrounding commercial broadcasting in the uk and form a super regulator within the industry called ofcom .
changes to existing legislation would allow media giants such as rupert murdoch 's news international to buy channel 5 , if it so wished .
it would also enable us giants such as disney or time warner to take over commercial broadcasting licences .
lord currie of marylebone has been named as the first head of the new communications and media regulator .
the office of communications , or ofcom , will act as a one-stop-shop regulator , pulling together under one umbrella the current cluster of media watchdogs in the uk .
the bill will also rule on cross-media ownership .
' light touch ' bbc business reporter hywel jones says there are indications in whitehall which seem to suggest that some members of the committee have reservations about the plans .
the government has said it wants ofcom to have a " light touch " that will encourage growth in commercial broadcasting as an industry in the uk .
supporters of the proposals say commercial broadcasting would benefit from foreign investment , particularly from the united states - the centre of the world 's broadcasting industry .
dumping ground the potential for american investment would be a welcome boost for the uk industry which is just coming out of an advertising downturn that has led to many redundancies over the last couple of years .
but hywel jones says some committee members are concerned that ofcom would not be set up quickly enough .
they would prefer to see ofcom up and running to prove itself for a couple of years before the changes are introduced .
they also fear the changes would make the uk a dumping ground for cheap american programming which would do little or nothing to encourage investment in new programming , new production or new jobs in the uk .

wanadoo chief executive nicolas dufourcq has drawn up plans to re-name freeserve in a re-branding exercise that could cost as much as £ 30m -lrb- 47.4m euros ; $ 46.8m -rrb- , the sunday telegraph reported .
" it would be ... in keeping with wanadoo 's multi-domestic strategy for us to operate under a single brand , " the newspaper quoted mr dufourcq as saying .
the name change , which could take effect as early as next year , would force freeserve 's 2.5m british customers to change the suffix of their e-mail addresses from ' @ freeserve.co.uk ' to ' @ wanadoo.com. '
pioneer freeserve , set up by the high street electrical goods chain dixons in 1998 , was the first uk firm to offer internet access without subscription charges .
it was partially floated on the stock market the following year , reaching a peak valuation of about £ 8bn - more than dixons itself - at the height of the internet boom .
wanadoo , part-owned by french telephone giant france telecom , acquired freeserve for about £ 1.6bn in december 2000 .
freeserve chief executive john pluthero last week announced that he was leaving the firm to take over as head of troubled telecoms firm energis .
