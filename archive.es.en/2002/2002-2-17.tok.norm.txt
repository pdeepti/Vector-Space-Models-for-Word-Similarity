"
leaving harare today my feelings are more of sorrow than of anger " pierre schori pierre schori , who was in zimbabwe on a tourist visa having been refused accreditation by the country 's government , flew out of the country on saturday night to london .
mr schori 's departure came as zimbabwe 's state tv reported a visit by mr mugabe to mozambique on sunday to discuss the elections and the " situation in the country " with regional leaders .
mr mugabe is expected to hold talks with president joaquim chissano and bakili muluzi , president of malawi and chairman of the south african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- .
the sadc is on monday expected to start sending observers for the presidential elections , but analysts say the organisation lacks the political will to enforce mr mugabe 's assertions that the poll will be free and fair .
' sorrow ' mr schori 's visa , which had a week left to run , was cancelled on saturday and he was given another visa set to expire at midnight .
" leaving harare today my feelings are more of sorrow than of anger , " he said before boarding his flight out of the country .
the bbc 's barnaby phillips says the eu now faces a difficult dilemma : whether to impose sanctions and pull out its 30 monitors , or stay in the hope their presence may reduce violence in the run up to the 9-10 march poll .
the eu is due to consider the issue on monday .
mr schori refused to comment on the chances of sanctions being applied , saying the issues would be decided by eu foreign ministers when they meet in brussels on monday .
it was not immediately clear what , if anything , mr schori had done wrong .
but he had been warned by zimbabwean officials that his tourist status meant he should not talk about the upcoming election .
he called zimbabwe 's demands that he not talk with journalists " surprising and unacceptable " .
zimbabwe 's home affairs minister , john nkomo , told the bbc that mr schori had violated the conditions under which his visa was granted .
challenge to mugabe zimbabwe 's government says it will not be bullied into accepting observers from countries deemed hostile to mr mugabe .
the government has already said that six european countries are not allowed to send observers .
the government accuses britain , denmark , finland , germany , the netherlands and sweden of supporting the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- .
its leader , morgan tsvangirai , is set to pose the toughest challenge yet to mr mugabe 's 22-year hold on power in the march election .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- tesco starts supermarket price war categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics sunday , 17 february , 2002 , 08:50 gmt tesco starts supermarket price war tesco is cutting the prices of 1,500 products by £ 70m shoppers are set to cash in as the four leading supermarket chains prepare for their fiercest price war yet .
market leader tesco has announced it is cutting the cost of 15,000 items on its shelves - offering customers a total saving of £ 70m - compared with january 2001 prices .
the announcement follows a year of price cuts that have already left the store 's shoppers with an extra £ 200m in their pockets .
but the chain 's main rival , j sainsbury , which lost its number one spot to tesco in 1995 , says shoppers should not fall for short-term price cuts .
tesco and asda are the price-cutters and they are the ones who have grown their businesses during the past five years tesco marketing director tim mason tesco , along with the uk 's third-ranked retailer , asda , believes in offering customers low prices across the range of goods they stock .
but sainsbury and safeway , the uk 's number four , rely on bigger discounts on selected items .
a spokesman said sainsbury 's own wide selection of special offers - including buy-one-get-one-free deals on 50 different products - reflected a " constant , long-term approach to cutting prices " .
and although the store has cut the cost of 3,000 items during the past year , managing director stuart michell says its customers consider quality and service to be " more and more " important .
but tesco marketing director tim mason says most shoppers are looking for low prices first and foremost .
he told bbc news : " tesco and asda are the price-cutters and they are the ones who have grown their businesses during the past five years .
" sainsbury and safeway have tried different things and their businesses have not grown as fast . "
it all depends on the products you pick - and that is where the confusion comes in for the consumer clive beddall the grocer tesco director john gildersleeve says its price-cutting policy is also " helping keep a lid on inflation " .
but clive beddall , editor of retail magazine the grocer , told bbc news that during the past five years asda 's prices have been consistently lower - beating tesco into second place .
that assessment is based on the cost of a " typical " weekly shopping basket containing 33 different items .
but as mr beddall explains : " it all depends on the products you pick - and that is where the confusion comes in for the consumer . "
