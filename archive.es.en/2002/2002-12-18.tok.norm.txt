the small czech town has developed into a sexual oasis for pedophiles . but although the czech interior ministry admits that child prostitution exists on the border area , officials maintain that the child sex trade is not an organized phenomenon . catherin schauer and ludmilla irmscher beg to differ .
the two social workers -lrb- schauer is from germany , irmscher is czech -rrb- have been working on a community project there since 1994 seeking to protect both children and adults working in the sex industry .

children from slovakia and the former soviet union are kidnapped then smuggled into the area to work as prostitutes and in many cases mothers will offer their own children up for prostitution , “ effectively selling them to pedophiles ” , schauer says . but there are no easy answers .

the small czech town has developed into a sexual oasis for pedophiles . but although the czech interior ministry admits that child prostitution exists on the border area , officials maintain that the child sex trade is not an organized phenomenon . catherin schauer and ludmilla irmscher beg to differ .
the two social workers -lrb- schauer is from germany , irmscher is czech -rrb- have been working on a community project there since 1994 seeking to protect both children and adults working in the sex industry .
reports from german media hold that children as young as 5 years old are involved with prostitution on the border . the so-called karo project works to help prevent the spread of hiv / aids and other sexually transmitted infections among prostitutes and drug users working in the border region . a mecca for pedophiles the border region between germany and the czech republic has long been developing into something of a mecca for pedophiles . schauer and irmscher say pedophiles travel intentionally to the region where child sex workers are easy to find . that the trade in child prostitutes is still big business is no real surprise in an area which is still very poor .
children from slovakia and the former soviet union are kidnapped then smuggled into the area to work as prostitutes and in many cases mothers will offer their own children up for prostitution , “ effectively selling them to pedophiles ” , schauer says . but there are no easy answers .
although schauer and irmscher look after the children at risk several times a week and report the licence plate numbers of suspicious german cars to the respective authorities that is all they can do .
“ what we ’ re doing at the moment is solely crisis intervention , damage limitation , ” irmscher says . “ we can ’ t just go out onto the streets and take the child away – that would be abduction . ” czech-german cooperation offers hope but closer cooperation between the czech and german authorities may offer more hope in the fight to beat pedophilia in cheb . two years ago , the karo project – which receives eu funding as well as financial support from the family ministry in saxony – joined forces with a larger group set up to fight trafficking in women .
additionally , the saxon authorities have also made progress in the battle , distributing leaflets in the area to raise awareness of the problem . and now , negotiations are under way between the german police in the state of saxony and czech police .

he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her with various propaganda films .
her first work , " triumph of will " , a documentation of the nuremberg rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 . the powerful effects of riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made riefenstahl ’ s documentations both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the repressive nazi regime . riefenstahl claims her film " olympia " glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .

the opposition conservatives blocked a bill providing for reform in the low-pay job sector last month .
but a joint mediation committee of the bundesrat upper house , where the conservatives have a majority , and the bundestag , reached an agreement on tuesday for raising the pay threshold at which employees have to pay tax and social benefits from 325 to 400 euros .
the bill will be considered by the bundesrat on friday , but is expected to pass without significant opposition .
german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said the bill would cost the government 1 billion euros in lost revenue .
but the law , which would take effect in april , is also expected to create more than 300,000 jobs .
with more than 4 million people unemployed in germany , job creation – even of the low-paying kind – is an important concern across the political spectrum .
under the agreement reached tuesday , there is also a provision for incremental tax and social services contributions for those earning between 400 and 800 euros a month .
issue of temporary workers still controversial however , another central aspect of the job reform package presented by the commission led by volkswagen executive peter hartz and comprising of representatives from industry , unions , science and politics , still remains unresolved .
the issue of payment of temporary workers has sparked controversy .
the proposed reforms call for the right to pay temporary workers less money than their full-time counterparts .
german unions have stepped in to oppose this aspect of the reform package and the future of this provision remains uncertain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's temp work plan faces challenge the government 's plan to promote temporary work for its close to four million unemployed is facing considerable criticism in parliament .

the co-operative was set up with the help of the german development agency gtz .
it has trained staff in the fundamentals of waste sorting and provided them with a computer system , with which members can check the current prices of materials such as glass and paper online .
the recycling co-operative is headed by edleuza vlinaia santos , a former waste-picker .
santos now has accounting skills .
she says the gtz trained her and the staff at the centre to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic .
as santos told dw radio 's john hay , the atmosphere in the centre is much more harmonious now that the workers are no longer competing with one another for their survival .
" we really are better off than we used to be .
we work peacefully together , and we don ’ t fight amongst ourselves .
now that we all receive regular wages , we do n't have to worry so much . "
a model partnership gtz , as well as helping to found sao sebastiao 's recycling co-operative , has also supported a program to improve storage and processing techniques , making the municipality a model of good waste management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern waste dump in sao sebastiao .
sao sebastiao 's landfill is no longer an eyesore .
and it also smells better , thanks to a public-private partnership between the municipality , a brazilian company that collects and transports waste to the landfill site , and the german company faber .
several decades ago , faber developed a technique known as ‘ mechanical-biological treatment ’ in which waste decomposes in carefully ventilated rotting heaps .
" we trialled these processes in germany during the 1960s , " says wolfgang tönges , faber ’ s managing director .
" it makes a compelling reason to buy our products , when people realise they can jump several developmental steps and avoid making the same mistakes that were made in europe . "
hi-tech waste management uncontrolled , untreated household waste takes up to four hundred years to decompose fully .
during this time , it emits fluids which contaminate ground water , as well as harmful methane gas .
mechanical-biological treatment reduces the time of decomposition to twelve months or less .
almost no methane is produced .
the waste heaps are keep off the ground with plastic sheeting to avoid contamination of the ground water .
the addition of small amounts of bacteria contained in water collected at the base of the dumps helps the rotting material to decompose quickly .
the heaps of rotting waste consist of several layers , separated by wooden pallets to ensure proper ventilation .
the top layer of each pile - the biofilter - consists of wood chips , resembling a forest floor and giving an overall impression of orderliness .
global markets like ninety percent of municipalities in brazil , most developing countries and emerging economies have uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills , creating a sizeable market for faber ’ s expertise .
more landfills using german technology are planned in several countries including mexico , south africa and mozambique .
proper management of these sites will improve the health and well-being of the residents as well as helping to preserve their environmental resources for the future .
reduce , re-use , recycle recycling is an effective way to reduce the quantity of waste for disposal .
and hi-tech landfills can help keep the environment clean .
but it ’ s also important to avoid producing waste in the first place , according to gtz advisor dieter munz .
" we have to look at the beginning of the process , as well as the end , " munz says .
" that means we also have to look at co-operating with supermarkets , to tackle the problem of waste creation much earlier . "

now , thanks to the popularity of more efficient gas kilns , vietnamese exports to europe , australia and japan are claiming a growing slice of the market . many old-style pottery kilns still operating throughout vietnam use large quantities of wood , coal or rice husks .
over centuries , high fuel consumption in traditional ceramics production has contributed to serious environmental problems , including pollution , deforestation and soil erosion .
" there are hardly any forests left , " says the gtz 's peter bock in hanoi .
" most of the hard wood used here now is imported from neighbouring countries like laos and cambodia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old vietnamese pottery kiln dirty business in north vietnam , most ceramics producers have switched from wood to coal in the past few decades .
in many northern villages , like bat trang near hanoi , this has led to severe air pollution . the ancient town 's unsealed roads are covered in black dust from the coal kilns , and a smoky haze hangs in the air .
going green with gas improving conditions in villages like bat trang was one incentive for the german development agency gtz to get involved , introducing new technology which has made ceramics production throughout vietnam much more efficient , and less of an environmental hazard .
a number of vietnamese companies had already begun to import cleaner gas kilns from taiwan and japan , but these were expensive , and operation costs were too high .
gtz 's gas kiln , which uses high-tech fibre mats , is cheaper and more energy efficient , and can be built locally .
as the head fireman at the minh duc factory near saigon , le hong hung told dw radio 's anke rasper , it 's also cleaner , cooler and easier to operate .
" the new kilns are less smoky , everything is very clean .
and the work environment around the kiln is much cooler .
we also get a much better quality product . "
for the export market , a fast delivery time and good quality are essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women working in a vietnamese ceramic factory the gas kilns also cut labour costs .
fewer people are needed to operate several gas kilns than are required to work on a single traditional ' dragon ' kiln .
firing takes only half a day instead of up to a week .
environmental damage is also significantly reduced , because burning gas emits a fraction of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- of wood or coal .
simply hi-tech ceramics expert and gtz consultant bernd pfannkuche designed the gas kilns , which have also been introduced in the philippines and thailand .
he says his design combines the most sophisticated fibre material on the market with steel and other locally available materials .
" we used a firing system that was developed in germany in the middle ages for wood kilns , but it ’ s adapted to the conditions needed for a modern gas kiln , " pfannkuche says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's new gas kiln the german design has not been patented and so is available to everyone .
in the past two years , vietnamese engineers have improved on the prototype first constructed in saigon by gtz together with the state-owned vietnamese company vinaceglass .
efficiency costs despite their efficiency advantages , gtz 's gas kilns are still more expensive than their wood- and coal-fired predecessors .
depending on the size , the price for one of gtz 's kilns is between 15,000 and 35,000 dollars .
the final costs are usually even higher , says company owner nguyen van minh .
" in addition to the investment for the kiln itself , we have to pay for a gas tank too , so we can store gas , " he says .
" together with kiln equipment , that brings the cost up to about usd50,000 . "
the vietnamese government has tried to help , granting cheap credits to factories investing in energy-efficient technology .
it has also introduced regulations prohibiting the use of wood as an energy source in new factories .
the good news for ceramics producers is that gas has become more affordable since large deposits of lpg were discovered off the vietnamese coast in the south china sea .
with new gas pipelines under construction , prices are expected to fall even further .
in the next decade , the entire ceramics industry in vietnam , comprising more than a thousand factories , is expected to switch to gas technology .
the country 's ceramics are set to become even more competitive in international markets . all the same , many producers say they 'll keep at least one of their dragon kilns , for old times ' sake .

but with the help of german technology , one municipality near sao paolo has developed better ways to dispose of its garbage . in sao paolo , a city of around twenty million people , stinking landfills reach heights of up to eighty metres .
fluids which seep through contaminate the groundwater , posing a serious health threat .
many of these waste dumps are in danger of collapsing .
all over brazil , uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills provide a meagre living to waste-pickers who scavenge in the piles of rotting garbage .
but in the town of sao sebastiao , near sao paolo , the tips , and the waste-pickers , have vanished .
in their place the town boasts one of the cleanest and neatest landfill sites in latin america .

in many northern villages , like bat trang near hanoi , this has led to severe air pollution . the ancient town 's unsealed roads are covered in black dust from the coal kilns , and a smoky haze hangs in the air .
going green with gas improving conditions in villages like bat trang was one incentive for the german development agency gtz to get involved , introducing new technology which has made ceramics production throughout vietnam much more efficient , and less of an environmental hazard .
a number of vietnamese companies had already begun to import cleaner gas kilns from taiwan and japan , but these were expensive , and operation costs were too high .
gtz 's gas kiln , which uses high-tech fibre mats , is cheaper and more energy efficient , and can be built locally .
as the head fireman at the minh duc factory near saigon , le hong hung told dw radio 's anke rasper , it 's also cleaner , cooler and easier to operate .
" the new kilns are less smoky , everything is very clean .
and the work environment around the kiln is much cooler .
we also get a much better quality product . "
for the export market , a fast delivery time and good quality are essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women working in a vietnamese ceramic factory the gas kilns also cut labour costs .
fewer people are needed to operate several gas kilns than are required to work on a single traditional ' dragon ' kiln .
firing takes only half a day instead of up to a week .
environmental damage is also significantly reduced , because burning gas emits a fraction of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- of wood or coal .
simply hi-tech ceramics expert and gtz consultant bernd pfannkuche designed the gas kilns , which have also been introduced in the philippines and thailand .
he says his design combines the most sophisticated fibre material on the market with steel and other locally available materials .
" we used a firing system that was developed in germany in the middle ages for wood kilns , but it ’ s adapted to the conditions needed for a modern gas kiln , " pfannkuche says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's new gas kiln the german design has not been patented and so is available to everyone .
in the past two years , vietnamese engineers have improved on the prototype first constructed in saigon by gtz together with the state-owned vietnamese company vinaceglass .
efficiency costs despite their efficiency advantages , gtz 's gas kilns are still more expensive than their wood- and coal-fired predecessors .
depending on the size , the price for one of gtz 's kilns is between 15,000 and 35,000 dollars .
the final costs are usually even higher , says company owner nguyen van minh .
" in addition to the investment for the kiln itself , we have to pay for a gas tank too , so we can store gas , " he says .
" together with kiln equipment , that brings the cost up to about usd50,000 . "
the vietnamese government has tried to help , granting cheap credits to factories investing in energy-efficient technology .
it has also introduced regulations prohibiting the use of wood as an energy source in new factories .
the good news for ceramics producers is that gas has become more affordable since large deposits of lpg were discovered off the vietnamese coast in the south china sea .
with new gas pipelines under construction , prices are expected to fall even further .
in the next decade , the entire ceramics industry in vietnam , comprising more than a thousand factories , is expected to switch to gas technology .
the country 's ceramics are set to become even more competitive in international markets . all the same , many producers say they 'll keep at least one of their dragon kilns , for old times ' sake .

electricity production in china is a dirty and inefficient business .

with the help of german technology and expertise , coal power plants in china are becoming cleaner , greener and more competitive . with a population approaching 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy , china has enormous energy needs .
but although the country 's power sector is the biggest in the world , at current capacity , it ’ s unable to match supply with demand .
most of china 's energy is generated by burning coal , a fossil fuel which produces large quantities of carbon and sulphur dioxide , polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .

air pollution in chinese cities has become a serious problem , perhaps worse than germany ’ s industrial region experienced in the 1960 ’ s and 70 ’ s , according to dr stefan schmitz , responsible for the energy and transport sector in the german ministry for economic co-operation and development .
" china aims to reduce co2 emissions the same way we did -lrb- in germany -rrb- , by increasing the share of renewable energies , by reducing emission levels in the conventional power sector and introducing filter systems like fluegas desulphuration plants and clean coal technologies , " schmitz told dw radio ’ s peter zimmermann .
china is trying to cap its greenhouse gas emissions another way , with the help of the gtz , germany ’ s development agency .
with measuring vehicles supplied through a german-chinese technical and financial co-operation project , coal power stations across the country are being introduced to sophisticated technology to help them increase efficiency .
hi-tech trucks the fifteen measurement vehicles used in the project are financed with a € 10m loan from germany 's development bank kfw .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars given by german experts to skilled workers and engineers in china .
jörg moczadlo , who runs the german side of the project , says the chinese engineers are receiving training in germany as well as on the spot in chinese plants , to conduct performance optimizations using appropriate and advanced methods .
" when the project ends , the chinese side should be able to continue by themselves , " moczadlo explains .
" it ’ s very important that they learn better procedures and stick to using them if the project is going to be sustainable . "
bottom line benefit performance optimization in coal power plants means not only reducing co2 emissions , it also means less coal is needed to produce the same amount of electricity .
coal is not cheap in china , and many producers have realized that they can achieve huge cost savings by implementing the gtz ’ s plan .
as well as the main state power corporation , eleven smaller chinese utilities are involved in the project .
but despite its obvious benefits , the vice president of the shanxi power research institute , qi zhiming , says it wasn ’ t easy at first to bring electricity producers in his province around to the idea .
" we tried hard and we ’ re still making every effort to introduce our measuring technology to the important people , " says qi .
" we recently organized a seminar to explain to leading managers how our technical expertise and equipment would pay off with greater efficiency . "
profiting from liberalization in the past , china ’ s energy sector has been highly centralized , and this has made the it inefficient , inflexible and not geared to customers ’ needs .
cost saving is a relatively new idea for china ’ s power producers .
now a process known as ‘ unbundling ’ is taking place .
new companies are being created for generation , transport and distribution , which operate according to the rules of a market economy .
xie yun , a senior engineer with the state power corporation , says the liberalization process has introduced competition into the market .
this has changed the way companies do business .
" since the introduction of competition , power corporations have had to become profit conscious , " says xie .
" companies have to find ways to cut costs and make their product more attractive . "
xie is optimistic about his company ’ s partnership with the gtz , because of the advice and technical support the german agency can provide .
for its part , the german side considers china ’ s participation in the project to be a sign of commitment to tackling the challenges of reforming the country ’ s energy sector and improving the environmental situation .
but the process can not happen overnight .
engineer dr rolf krane says there are still differences in structure and approach .

but with the help of german technology , one municipality near sao paolo has developed better ways to dispose of its garbage . in sao paolo , a city of around twenty million people , stinking landfills reach heights of up to eighty metres .
fluids which seep through contaminate the groundwater , posing a serious health threat .
many of these waste dumps are in danger of collapsing .
all over brazil , uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills provide a meagre living to waste-pickers who scavenge in the piles of rotting garbage .
but in the town of sao sebastiao , near sao paolo , the tips , and the waste-pickers , have vanished .
in their place the town boasts one of the cleanest and neatest landfill sites in latin america .
changed lives the lives of the former waste-pickers have changed dramatically .
many people who used to spend long days sifting through rubbish out in the open , knee-deep in filth , are now employed sorting marketable waste at a recycling co-operative near the town centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the recycling co-operative sao sebastiao , brazil .
the co-operative was set up with the help of the german development agency gtz .
it has trained staff in the fundamentals of waste sorting and provided them with a computer system , with which members can check the current prices of materials such as glass and paper online .
the recycling co-operative is headed by edleuza vlinaia santos , a former waste-picker .
santos now has accounting skills .
she says the gtz trained her and the staff at the centre to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic .
as santos told dw radio 's john hay , the atmosphere in the centre is much more harmonious now that the workers are no longer competing with one another for their survival .
" we really are better off than we used to be .
we work peacefully together , and we don ’ t fight amongst ourselves .
now that we all receive regular wages , we do n't have to worry so much . "
a model partnership gtz , as well as helping to found sao sebastiao 's recycling co-operative , has also supported a program to improve storage and processing techniques , making the municipality a model of good waste management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern waste dump in sao sebastiao .
sao sebastiao 's landfill is no longer an eyesore .
and it also smells better , thanks to a public-private partnership between the municipality , a brazilian company that collects and transports waste to the landfill site , and the german company faber .
several decades ago , faber developed a technique known as ‘ mechanical-biological treatment ’ in which waste decomposes in carefully ventilated rotting heaps .
" we trialled these processes in germany during the 1960s , " says wolfgang tönges , faber ’ s managing director .
" it makes a compelling reason to buy our products , when people realise they can jump several developmental steps and avoid making the same mistakes that were made in europe . "
hi-tech waste management uncontrolled , untreated household waste takes up to four hundred years to decompose fully .
during this time , it emits fluids which contaminate ground water , as well as harmful methane gas .
mechanical-biological treatment reduces the time of decomposition to twelve months or less .
almost no methane is produced .
the waste heaps are keep off the ground with plastic sheeting to avoid contamination of the ground water .
the addition of small amounts of bacteria contained in water collected at the base of the dumps helps the rotting material to decompose quickly .
the heaps of rotting waste consist of several layers , separated by wooden pallets to ensure proper ventilation .
the top layer of each pile - the biofilter - consists of wood chips , resembling a forest floor and giving an overall impression of orderliness .
global markets like ninety percent of municipalities in brazil , most developing countries and emerging economies have uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills , creating a sizeable market for faber ’ s expertise .
more landfills using german technology are planned in several countries including mexico , south africa and mozambique .
proper management of these sites will improve the health and well-being of the residents as well as helping to preserve their environmental resources for the future .
reduce , re-use , recycle recycling is an effective way to reduce the quantity of waste for disposal .
and hi-tech landfills can help keep the environment clean .
but it ’ s also important to avoid producing waste in the first place , according to gtz advisor dieter munz .
" we have to look at the beginning of the process , as well as the end , " munz says .
" that means we also have to look at co-operating with supermarkets , to tackle the problem of waste creation much earlier . "

electricity production in china is a dirty and inefficient business .

with the help of german technology and expertise , coal power plants in china are becoming cleaner , greener and more competitive . with a population approaching 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy , china has enormous energy needs .
but although the country 's power sector is the biggest in the world , at current capacity , it ’ s unable to match supply with demand .
most of china 's energy is generated by burning coal , a fossil fuel which produces large quantities of carbon and sulphur dioxide , polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .

air pollution in chinese cities has become a serious problem , perhaps worse than germany ’ s industrial region experienced in the 1960 ’ s and 70 ’ s , according to dr stefan schmitz , responsible for the energy and transport sector in the german ministry for economic co-operation and development .
" china aims to reduce co2 emissions the same way we did -lrb- in germany -rrb- , by increasing the share of renewable energies , by reducing emission levels in the conventional power sector and introducing filter systems like fluegas desulphuration plants and clean coal technologies , " schmitz told dw radio ’ s peter zimmermann .
china is trying to cap its greenhouse gas emissions another way , with the help of the gtz , germany ’ s development agency .
with measuring vehicles supplied through a german-chinese technical and financial co-operation project , coal power stations across the country are being introduced to sophisticated technology to help them increase efficiency .

" when the project ends , the chinese side should be able to continue by themselves , " moczadlo explains .
" it ’ s very important that they learn better procedures and stick to using them if the project is going to be sustainable . "
bottom line benefit performance optimization in coal power plants means not only reducing co2 emissions , it also means less coal is needed to produce the same amount of electricity .
coal is not cheap in china , and many producers have realized that they can achieve huge cost savings by implementing the gtz ’ s plan .
as well as the main state power corporation , eleven smaller chinese utilities are involved in the project .
but despite its obvious benefits , the vice president of the shanxi power research institute , qi zhiming , says it wasn ’ t easy at first to bring electricity producers in his province around to the idea .
" we tried hard and we ’ re still making every effort to introduce our measuring technology to the important people , " says qi .

cost saving is a relatively new idea for china ’ s power producers .
now a process known as ‘ unbundling ’ is taking place .
new companies are being created for generation , transport and distribution , which operate according to the rules of a market economy .
xie yun , a senior engineer with the state power corporation , says the liberalization process has introduced competition into the market .
this has changed the way companies do business .
" since the introduction of competition , power corporations have had to become profit conscious , " says xie .
" companies have to find ways to cut costs and make their product more attractive . "
xie is optimistic about his company ’ s partnership with the gtz , because of the advice and technical support the german agency can provide .
for its part , the german side considers china ’ s participation in the project to be a sign of commitment to tackling the challenges of reforming the country ’ s energy sector and improving the environmental situation .
but the process can not happen overnight .

now , thanks to the popularity of more efficient gas kilns , vietnamese exports to europe , australia and japan are claiming a growing slice of the market . many old-style pottery kilns still operating throughout vietnam use large quantities of wood , coal or rice husks .
over centuries , high fuel consumption in traditional ceramics production has contributed to serious environmental problems , including pollution , deforestation and soil erosion .
" there are hardly any forests left , " says the gtz 's peter bock in hanoi .
" most of the hard wood used here now is imported from neighbouring countries like laos and cambodia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old vietnamese pottery kiln dirty business in north vietnam , most ceramics producers have switched from wood to coal in the past few decades .
in many northern villages , like bat trang near hanoi , this has led to severe air pollution . the ancient town 's unsealed roads are covered in black dust from the coal kilns , and a smoky haze hangs in the air .
going green with gas improving conditions in villages like bat trang was one incentive for the german development agency gtz to get involved , introducing new technology which has made ceramics production throughout vietnam much more efficient , and less of an environmental hazard .
a number of vietnamese companies had already begun to import cleaner gas kilns from taiwan and japan , but these were expensive , and operation costs were too high .
gtz 's gas kiln , which uses high-tech fibre mats , is cheaper and more energy efficient , and can be built locally .
as the head fireman at the minh duc factory near saigon , le hong hung told dw radio 's anke rasper , it 's also cleaner , cooler and easier to operate .
" the new kilns are less smoky , everything is very clean .
and the work environment around the kiln is much cooler .
we also get a much better quality product . "
for the export market , a fast delivery time and good quality are essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women working in a vietnamese ceramic factory the gas kilns also cut labour costs .
fewer people are needed to operate several gas kilns than are required to work on a single traditional ' dragon ' kiln .
firing takes only half a day instead of up to a week .
environmental damage is also significantly reduced , because burning gas emits a fraction of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- of wood or coal .
simply hi-tech ceramics expert and gtz consultant bernd pfannkuche designed the gas kilns , which have also been introduced in the philippines and thailand .
he says his design combines the most sophisticated fibre material on the market with steel and other locally available materials .
" we used a firing system that was developed in germany in the middle ages for wood kilns , but it ’ s adapted to the conditions needed for a modern gas kiln , " pfannkuche says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's new gas kiln the german design has not been patented and so is available to everyone .
in the past two years , vietnamese engineers have improved on the prototype first constructed in saigon by gtz together with the state-owned vietnamese company vinaceglass .
efficiency costs despite their efficiency advantages , gtz 's gas kilns are still more expensive than their wood- and coal-fired predecessors .
depending on the size , the price for one of gtz 's kilns is between 15,000 and 35,000 dollars .
the final costs are usually even higher , says company owner nguyen van minh .
" in addition to the investment for the kiln itself , we have to pay for a gas tank too , so we can store gas , " he says .
" together with kiln equipment , that brings the cost up to about usd50,000 . "
the vietnamese government has tried to help , granting cheap credits to factories investing in energy-efficient technology .
it has also introduced regulations prohibiting the use of wood as an energy source in new factories .
the good news for ceramics producers is that gas has become more affordable since large deposits of lpg were discovered off the vietnamese coast in the south china sea .
with new gas pipelines under construction , prices are expected to fall even further .
in the next decade , the entire ceramics industry in vietnam , comprising more than a thousand factories , is expected to switch to gas technology .
the country 's ceramics are set to become even more competitive in international markets . all the same , many producers say they 'll keep at least one of their dragon kilns , for old times ' sake .

electricity production in china is a dirty and inefficient business .
but that 's changing .
with the help of german technology and expertise , coal power plants in china are becoming cleaner , greener and more competitive . with a population approaching 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy , china has enormous energy needs .
but although the country 's power sector is the biggest in the world , at current capacity , it ’ s unable to match supply with demand .
most of china 's energy is generated by burning coal , a fossil fuel which produces large quantities of carbon and sulphur dioxide , polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .

air pollution in chinese cities has become a serious problem , perhaps worse than germany ’ s industrial region experienced in the 1960 ’ s and 70 ’ s , according to dr stefan schmitz , responsible for the energy and transport sector in the german ministry for economic co-operation and development .
" china aims to reduce co2 emissions the same way we did -lrb- in germany -rrb- , by increasing the share of renewable energies , by reducing emission levels in the conventional power sector and introducing filter systems like fluegas desulphuration plants and clean coal technologies , " schmitz told dw radio ’ s peter zimmermann .
china is trying to cap its greenhouse gas emissions another way , with the help of the gtz , germany ’ s development agency .
with measuring vehicles supplied through a german-chinese technical and financial co-operation project , coal power stations across the country are being introduced to sophisticated technology to help them increase efficiency .
hi-tech trucks the fifteen measurement vehicles used in the project are financed with a € 10m loan from germany 's development bank kfw .
the trucks , equipped with high-tech equipment , travel to power plants across china conducting performance optimizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars given by german experts to skilled workers and engineers in china .
jörg moczadlo , who runs the german side of the project , says the chinese engineers are receiving training in germany as well as on the spot in chinese plants , to conduct performance optimizations using appropriate and advanced methods .
" when the project ends , the chinese side should be able to continue by themselves , " moczadlo explains .
" it ’ s very important that they learn better procedures and stick to using them if the project is going to be sustainable . "
bottom line benefit performance optimization in coal power plants means not only reducing co2 emissions , it also means less coal is needed to produce the same amount of electricity .
coal is not cheap in china , and many producers have realized that they can achieve huge cost savings by implementing the gtz ’ s plan .
as well as the main state power corporation , eleven smaller chinese utilities are involved in the project .
but despite its obvious benefits , the vice president of the shanxi power research institute , qi zhiming , says it wasn ’ t easy at first to bring electricity producers in his province around to the idea .
" we tried hard and we ’ re still making every effort to introduce our measuring technology to the important people , " says qi .
" we recently organized a seminar to explain to leading managers how our technical expertise and equipment would pay off with greater efficiency . "
profiting from liberalization in the past , china ’ s energy sector has been highly centralized , and this has made the it inefficient , inflexible and not geared to customers ’ needs .
cost saving is a relatively new idea for china ’ s power producers .
now a process known as ‘ unbundling ’ is taking place .
new companies are being created for generation , transport and distribution , which operate according to the rules of a market economy .
xie yun , a senior engineer with the state power corporation , says the liberalization process has introduced competition into the market .
this has changed the way companies do business .
" since the introduction of competition , power corporations have had to become profit conscious , " says xie .
" companies have to find ways to cut costs and make their product more attractive . "
xie is optimistic about his company ’ s partnership with the gtz , because of the advice and technical support the german agency can provide .
for its part , the german side considers china ’ s participation in the project to be a sign of commitment to tackling the challenges of reforming the country ’ s energy sector and improving the environmental situation .
but the process can not happen overnight .
engineer dr rolf krane says there are still differences in structure and approach .
" before they had a planned economy , and now they are starting to have competition , " says krane .
" now they are having to consider optimizing technology as well as economic and environmental questions , and i think it ’ s very unusual for chinese to have to think about these things . "
growing environmental awareness the measurement vehicle project began in april , 2001 .
germany ’ s federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has indicated that it might be willing to support a second phase .
meanwhile the power companies are hoping that a growing environmental awareness among residents of china ’ s cities will help progress , not hinder it .
the chinese people have become more conscious about environment issues , according to the state power corporation ’ s xie yun .
" we never had a problem building new power plants in the past , " xie explains .
" but today , local neighbourhoods have begun demonstrating in front of properties that have been earmarked .
‘ we don ’ t want a power plant on our doorstep , ’ they say . "
xie hopes that power companies will be able to get the public on side by using more environmentally-friendly technology in fossil fuel power plants .
there are also other ways to solve the problem , says wang ye , the measurement vehicle project manager in china .

electricity production in china is a dirty and inefficient business .
but that 's changing .
with the help of german technology and expertise , coal power plants in china are becoming cleaner , greener and more competitive . with a population approaching 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy , china has enormous energy needs .
but although the country 's power sector is the biggest in the world , at current capacity , it ’ s unable to match supply with demand .
most of china 's energy is generated by burning coal , a fossil fuel which produces large quantities of carbon and sulphur dioxide , polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .

air pollution in chinese cities has become a serious problem , perhaps worse than germany ’ s industrial region experienced in the 1960 ’ s and 70 ’ s , according to dr stefan schmitz , responsible for the energy and transport sector in the german ministry for economic co-operation and development .
" china aims to reduce co2 emissions the same way we did -lrb- in germany -rrb- , by increasing the share of renewable energies , by reducing emission levels in the conventional power sector and introducing filter systems like fluegas desulphuration plants and clean coal technologies , " schmitz told dw radio ’ s peter zimmermann .
china is trying to cap its greenhouse gas emissions another way , with the help of the gtz , germany ’ s development agency .
with measuring vehicles supplied through a german-chinese technical and financial co-operation project , coal power stations across the country are being introduced to sophisticated technology to help them increase efficiency .
hi-tech trucks the fifteen measurement vehicles used in the project are financed with a € 10m loan from germany 's development bank kfw .
the trucks , equipped with high-tech equipment , travel to power plants across china conducting performance optimizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars given by german experts to skilled workers and engineers in china .
jörg moczadlo , who runs the german side of the project , says the chinese engineers are receiving training in germany as well as on the spot in chinese plants , to conduct performance optimizations using appropriate and advanced methods .
" when the project ends , the chinese side should be able to continue by themselves , " moczadlo explains .
" it ’ s very important that they learn better procedures and stick to using them if the project is going to be sustainable . "
bottom line benefit performance optimization in coal power plants means not only reducing co2 emissions , it also means less coal is needed to produce the same amount of electricity .
coal is not cheap in china , and many producers have realized that they can achieve huge cost savings by implementing the gtz ’ s plan .
as well as the main state power corporation , eleven smaller chinese utilities are involved in the project .
but despite its obvious benefits , the vice president of the shanxi power research institute , qi zhiming , says it wasn ’ t easy at first to bring electricity producers in his province around to the idea .
" we tried hard and we ’ re still making every effort to introduce our measuring technology to the important people , " says qi .
" we recently organized a seminar to explain to leading managers how our technical expertise and equipment would pay off with greater efficiency . "
profiting from liberalization in the past , china ’ s energy sector has been highly centralized , and this has made the it inefficient , inflexible and not geared to customers ’ needs .
cost saving is a relatively new idea for china ’ s power producers .
now a process known as ‘ unbundling ’ is taking place .
new companies are being created for generation , transport and distribution , which operate according to the rules of a market economy .
xie yun , a senior engineer with the state power corporation , says the liberalization process has introduced competition into the market .
this has changed the way companies do business .
" since the introduction of competition , power corporations have had to become profit conscious , " says xie .
" companies have to find ways to cut costs and make their product more attractive . "
xie is optimistic about his company ’ s partnership with the gtz , because of the advice and technical support the german agency can provide .
for its part , the german side considers china ’ s participation in the project to be a sign of commitment to tackling the challenges of reforming the country ’ s energy sector and improving the environmental situation .
but the process can not happen overnight .
engineer dr rolf krane says there are still differences in structure and approach .
" before they had a planned economy , and now they are starting to have competition , " says krane .
" now they are having to consider optimizing technology as well as economic and environmental questions , and i think it ’ s very unusual for chinese to have to think about these things . "
growing environmental awareness the measurement vehicle project began in april , 2001 .
germany ’ s federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has indicated that it might be willing to support a second phase .
meanwhile the power companies are hoping that a growing environmental awareness among residents of china ’ s cities will help progress , not hinder it .
the chinese people have become more conscious about environment issues , according to the state power corporation ’ s xie yun .
" we never had a problem building new power plants in the past , " xie explains .
" but today , local neighbourhoods have begun demonstrating in front of properties that have been earmarked .
‘ we don ’ t want a power plant on our doorstep , ’ they say . "
xie hopes that power companies will be able to get the public on side by using more environmentally-friendly technology in fossil fuel power plants .
there are also other ways to solve the problem , says wang ye , the measurement vehicle project manager in china .
" decision-making processes need to be more scientific and efficient , " she says .
" before we demolish our cities and build new buildings , we should be thinking of ways to save energy .

electricity production in china is a dirty and inefficient business .
but that 's changing .
with the help of german technology and expertise , coal power plants in china are becoming cleaner , greener and more competitive . with a population approaching 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy , china has enormous energy needs .
but although the country 's power sector is the biggest in the world , at current capacity , it ’ s unable to match supply with demand .
most of china 's energy is generated by burning coal , a fossil fuel which produces large quantities of carbon and sulphur dioxide , polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's senior advisor jörg moczadlo -lrb- 2nd from right -rrb- , vice president qi zhiming -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- of shanxi electric power research institute and other chinese engineers discussing the optimization process in power plant shentou no. 2 .
air pollution in chinese cities has become a serious problem , perhaps worse than germany ’ s industrial region experienced in the 1960 ’ s and 70 ’ s , according to dr stefan schmitz , responsible for the energy and transport sector in the german ministry for economic co-operation and development .
" china aims to reduce co2 emissions the same way we did -lrb- in germany -rrb- , by increasing the share of renewable energies , by reducing emission levels in the conventional power sector and introducing filter systems like fluegas desulphuration plants and clean coal technologies , " schmitz told dw radio ’ s peter zimmermann .
china is trying to cap its greenhouse gas emissions another way , with the help of the gtz , germany ’ s development agency .
with measuring vehicles supplied through a german-chinese technical and financial co-operation project , coal power stations across the country are being introduced to sophisticated technology to help them increase efficiency .
hi-tech trucks the fifteen measurement vehicles used in the project are financed with a € 10m loan from germany 's development bank kfw .
the trucks , equipped with high-tech equipment , travel to power plants across china conducting performance optimizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars given by german experts to skilled workers and engineers in china .
jörg moczadlo , who runs the german side of the project , says the chinese engineers are receiving training in germany as well as on the spot in chinese plants , to conduct performance optimizations using appropriate and advanced methods .
" when the project ends , the chinese side should be able to continue by themselves , " moczadlo explains .
" it ’ s very important that they learn better procedures and stick to using them if the project is going to be sustainable . "
bottom line benefit performance optimization in coal power plants means not only reducing co2 emissions , it also means less coal is needed to produce the same amount of electricity .
coal is not cheap in china , and many producers have realized that they can achieve huge cost savings by implementing the gtz ’ s plan .
as well as the main state power corporation , eleven smaller chinese utilities are involved in the project .
but despite its obvious benefits , the vice president of the shanxi power research institute , qi zhiming , says it wasn ’ t easy at first to bring electricity producers in his province around to the idea .
" we tried hard and we ’ re still making every effort to introduce our measuring technology to the important people , " says qi .
" we recently organized a seminar to explain to leading managers how our technical expertise and equipment would pay off with greater efficiency . "
profiting from liberalization in the past , china ’ s energy sector has been highly centralized , and this has made the it inefficient , inflexible and not geared to customers ’ needs .
cost saving is a relatively new idea for china ’ s power producers .
now a process known as ‘ unbundling ’ is taking place .
new companies are being created for generation , transport and distribution , which operate according to the rules of a market economy .
xie yun , a senior engineer with the state power corporation , says the liberalization process has introduced competition into the market .
this has changed the way companies do business .
" since the introduction of competition , power corporations have had to become profit conscious , " says xie .
" companies have to find ways to cut costs and make their product more attractive . "
xie is optimistic about his company ’ s partnership with the gtz , because of the advice and technical support the german agency can provide .
for its part , the german side considers china ’ s participation in the project to be a sign of commitment to tackling the challenges of reforming the country ’ s energy sector and improving the environmental situation .
but the process can not happen overnight .
engineer dr rolf krane says there are still differences in structure and approach .
" before they had a planned economy , and now they are starting to have competition , " says krane .
" now they are having to consider optimizing technology as well as economic and environmental questions , and i think it ’ s very unusual for chinese to have to think about these things . "
growing environmental awareness the measurement vehicle project began in april , 2001 .
germany ’ s federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has indicated that it might be willing to support a second phase .
meanwhile the power companies are hoping that a growing environmental awareness among residents of china ’ s cities will help progress , not hinder it .
the chinese people have become more conscious about environment issues , according to the state power corporation ’ s xie yun .
" we never had a problem building new power plants in the past , " xie explains .
" but today , local neighbourhoods have begun demonstrating in front of properties that have been earmarked .
‘ we don ’ t want a power plant on our doorstep , ’ they say . "
xie hopes that power companies will be able to get the public on side by using more environmentally-friendly technology in fossil fuel power plants .
there are also other ways to solve the problem , says wang ye , the measurement vehicle project manager in china .
" decision-making processes need to be more scientific and efficient , " she says .
" before we demolish our cities and build new buildings , we should be thinking of ways to save energy .

but with the help of german technology , one municipality near sao paolo has developed better ways to dispose of its garbage . in sao paolo , a city of around twenty million people , stinking landfills reach heights of up to eighty metres .
fluids which seep through contaminate the groundwater , posing a serious health threat .
many of these waste dumps are in danger of collapsing .
all over brazil , uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills provide a meagre living to waste-pickers who scavenge in the piles of rotting garbage .
but in the town of sao sebastiao , near sao paolo , the tips , and the waste-pickers , have vanished .
in their place the town boasts one of the cleanest and neatest landfill sites in latin america .
changed lives the lives of the former waste-pickers have changed dramatically .
many people who used to spend long days sifting through rubbish out in the open , knee-deep in filth , are now employed sorting marketable waste at a recycling co-operative near the town centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the recycling co-operative sao sebastiao , brazil .
the co-operative was set up with the help of the german development agency gtz .
it has trained staff in the fundamentals of waste sorting and provided them with a computer system , with which members can check the current prices of materials such as glass and paper online .
the recycling co-operative is headed by edleuza vlinaia santos , a former waste-picker .
santos now has accounting skills .
she says the gtz trained her and the staff at the centre to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic .
as santos told dw radio 's john hay , the atmosphere in the centre is much more harmonious now that the workers are no longer competing with one another for their survival .
" we really are better off than we used to be .
we work peacefully together , and we don ’ t fight amongst ourselves .
now that we all receive regular wages , we do n't have to worry so much . "
a model partnership gtz , as well as helping to found sao sebastiao 's recycling co-operative , has also supported a program to improve storage and processing techniques , making the municipality a model of good waste management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern waste dump in sao sebastiao .
sao sebastiao 's landfill is no longer an eyesore .
and it also smells better , thanks to a public-private partnership between the municipality , a brazilian company that collects and transports waste to the landfill site , and the german company faber .
several decades ago , faber developed a technique known as ‘ mechanical-biological treatment ’ in which waste decomposes in carefully ventilated rotting heaps .
" we trialled these processes in germany during the 1960s , " says wolfgang tönges , faber ’ s managing director .
" it makes a compelling reason to buy our products , when people realise they can jump several developmental steps and avoid making the same mistakes that were made in europe . "
hi-tech waste management uncontrolled , untreated household waste takes up to four hundred years to decompose fully .
during this time , it emits fluids which contaminate ground water , as well as harmful methane gas .
mechanical-biological treatment reduces the time of decomposition to twelve months or less .
almost no methane is produced .
the waste heaps are keep off the ground with plastic sheeting to avoid contamination of the ground water .
the addition of small amounts of bacteria contained in water collected at the base of the dumps helps the rotting material to decompose quickly .
the heaps of rotting waste consist of several layers , separated by wooden pallets to ensure proper ventilation .
the top layer of each pile - the biofilter - consists of wood chips , resembling a forest floor and giving an overall impression of orderliness .
global markets like ninety percent of municipalities in brazil , most developing countries and emerging economies have uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills , creating a sizeable market for faber ’ s expertise .
more landfills using german technology are planned in several countries including mexico , south africa and mozambique .
proper management of these sites will improve the health and well-being of the residents as well as helping to preserve their environmental resources for the future .
reduce , re-use , recycle recycling is an effective way to reduce the quantity of waste for disposal .
and hi-tech landfills can help keep the environment clean .
but it ’ s also important to avoid producing waste in the first place , according to gtz advisor dieter munz .
" we have to look at the beginning of the process , as well as the end , " munz says .
" that means we also have to look at co-operating with supermarkets , to tackle the problem of waste creation much earlier . "

it has trained staff in the fundamentals of waste sorting and provided them with a computer system , with which members can check the current prices of materials such as glass and paper online .
the recycling co-operative is headed by edleuza vlinaia santos , a former waste-picker .
santos now has accounting skills .
she says the gtz trained her and the staff at the centre to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic .
as santos told dw radio 's john hay , the atmosphere in the centre is much more harmonious now that the workers are no longer competing with one another for their survival .
" we really are better off than we used to be .
we work peacefully together , and we don ’ t fight amongst ourselves .
now that we all receive regular wages , we do n't have to worry so much . "
a model partnership gtz , as well as helping to found sao sebastiao 's recycling co-operative , has also supported a program to improve storage and processing techniques , making the municipality a model of good waste management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern waste dump in sao sebastiao .
sao sebastiao 's landfill is no longer an eyesore .
and it also smells better , thanks to a public-private partnership between the municipality , a brazilian company that collects and transports waste to the landfill site , and the german company faber .
several decades ago , faber developed a technique known as ‘ mechanical-biological treatment ’ in which waste decomposes in carefully ventilated rotting heaps .
" we trialled these processes in germany during the 1960s , " says wolfgang tönges , faber ’ s managing director .
" it makes a compelling reason to buy our products , when people realise they can jump several developmental steps and avoid making the same mistakes that were made in europe . "
hi-tech waste management uncontrolled , untreated household waste takes up to four hundred years to decompose fully .
during this time , it emits fluids which contaminate ground water , as well as harmful methane gas .
mechanical-biological treatment reduces the time of decomposition to twelve months or less .
almost no methane is produced .
the waste heaps are keep off the ground with plastic sheeting to avoid contamination of the ground water .
the addition of small amounts of bacteria contained in water collected at the base of the dumps helps the rotting material to decompose quickly .
the heaps of rotting waste consist of several layers , separated by wooden pallets to ensure proper ventilation .
the top layer of each pile - the biofilter - consists of wood chips , resembling a forest floor and giving an overall impression of orderliness .
global markets like ninety percent of municipalities in brazil , most developing countries and emerging economies have uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills , creating a sizeable market for faber ’ s expertise .
more landfills using german technology are planned in several countries including mexico , south africa and mozambique .
proper management of these sites will improve the health and well-being of the residents as well as helping to preserve their environmental resources for the future .
reduce , re-use , recycle recycling is an effective way to reduce the quantity of waste for disposal .
and hi-tech landfills can help keep the environment clean .
but it ’ s also important to avoid producing waste in the first place , according to gtz advisor dieter munz .
" we have to look at the beginning of the process , as well as the end , " munz says .
" that means we also have to look at co-operating with supermarkets , to tackle the problem of waste creation much earlier . "

now , thanks to the popularity of more efficient gas kilns , vietnamese exports to europe , australia and japan are claiming a growing slice of the market . many old-style pottery kilns still operating throughout vietnam use large quantities of wood , coal or rice husks .
over centuries , high fuel consumption in traditional ceramics production has contributed to serious environmental problems , including pollution , deforestation and soil erosion .
" there are hardly any forests left , " says the gtz 's peter bock in hanoi .
" most of the hard wood used here now is imported from neighbouring countries like laos and cambodia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old vietnamese pottery kiln dirty business in north vietnam , most ceramics producers have switched from wood to coal in the past few decades .
in many northern villages , like bat trang near hanoi , this has led to severe air pollution . the ancient town 's unsealed roads are covered in black dust from the coal kilns , and a smoky haze hangs in the air .
going green with gas improving conditions in villages like bat trang was one incentive for the german development agency gtz to get involved , introducing new technology which has made ceramics production throughout vietnam much more efficient , and less of an environmental hazard .
a number of vietnamese companies had already begun to import cleaner gas kilns from taiwan and japan , but these were expensive , and operation costs were too high .
gtz 's gas kiln , which uses high-tech fibre mats , is cheaper and more energy efficient , and can be built locally .
as the head fireman at the minh duc factory near saigon , le hong hung told dw radio 's anke rasper , it 's also cleaner , cooler and easier to operate .
" the new kilns are less smoky , everything is very clean .
and the work environment around the kiln is much cooler .
we also get a much better quality product . "
for the export market , a fast delivery time and good quality are essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women working in a vietnamese ceramic factory the gas kilns also cut labour costs .
fewer people are needed to operate several gas kilns than are required to work on a single traditional ' dragon ' kiln .
firing takes only half a day instead of up to a week .
environmental damage is also significantly reduced , because burning gas emits a fraction of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- of wood or coal .
simply hi-tech ceramics expert and gtz consultant bernd pfannkuche designed the gas kilns , which have also been introduced in the philippines and thailand .
he says his design combines the most sophisticated fibre material on the market with steel and other locally available materials .
" we used a firing system that was developed in germany in the middle ages for wood kilns , but it ’ s adapted to the conditions needed for a modern gas kiln , " pfannkuche says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's new gas kiln the german design has not been patented and so is available to everyone .
in the past two years , vietnamese engineers have improved on the prototype first constructed in saigon by gtz together with the state-owned vietnamese company vinaceglass .
efficiency costs despite their efficiency advantages , gtz 's gas kilns are still more expensive than their wood- and coal-fired predecessors .
depending on the size , the price for one of gtz 's kilns is between 15,000 and 35,000 dollars .
the final costs are usually even higher , says company owner nguyen van minh .
" in addition to the investment for the kiln itself , we have to pay for a gas tank too , so we can store gas , " he says .
" together with kiln equipment , that brings the cost up to about usd50,000 . "
the vietnamese government has tried to help , granting cheap credits to factories investing in energy-efficient technology .
it has also introduced regulations prohibiting the use of wood as an energy source in new factories .
the good news for ceramics producers is that gas has become more affordable since large deposits of lpg were discovered off the vietnamese coast in the south china sea .
with new gas pipelines under construction , prices are expected to fall even further .
in the next decade , the entire ceramics industry in vietnam , comprising more than a thousand factories , is expected to switch to gas technology .
the country 's ceramics are set to become even more competitive in international markets . all the same , many producers say they 'll keep at least one of their dragon kilns , for old times ' sake .

a restrospective of the dancer , actress and film-maker 's comeback since the 1960 ’ s has now opened in bonn at the haus der geschichte , house of history museum , in bonn . ‘ hitler ’ s girl ’ born in 1902 , leni riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and across europe .
due to a knee injury , riefenstahl had to leave dancing , and turned subsequently to film . starting as an actress , she began directing her first films in the 1930 ’ s . it was her first feature film , “ the blue light ” , which attracted the then political rising star adolf hitler ’ s attention .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her with various propaganda films .
her first work , " triumph of will " , a documentation of the nuremberg rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 . the powerful effects of riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made riefenstahl ’ s documentations both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the repressive nazi regime . riefenstahl claims her film " olympia " glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .

a restrospective of the dancer , actress and film-maker 's comeback since the 1960 ’ s has now opened in bonn at the haus der geschichte , house of history museum , in bonn . ‘ hitler ’ s girl ’ born in 1902 , leni riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and across europe .
due to a knee injury , riefenstahl had to leave dancing , and turned subsequently to film . starting as an actress , she began directing her first films in the 1930 ’ s . it was her first feature film , “ the blue light ” , which attracted the then political rising star adolf hitler ’ s attention .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her with various propaganda films .
her first work , " triumph of will " , a documentation of the nuremberg rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 . the powerful effects of riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made riefenstahl ’ s documentations both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the repressive nazi regime . riefenstahl claims her film " olympia " glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to oust her after the war as " nazi pin-up girl " , " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl " . no politics leni riefenstahl has always denied any involvement in politics .
she has repeatedly underlined that despite her film-making under the nazi 's rule , she was never a member of the party itself .
in addition , she claims she was swept on with the tide of general enthusiasm for adolf hitler , and did not realize what he had been doing until it was too late . since the end of wwii , riefenstahl has contested , and won more than 50 libel suits on her invlovement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .

the small czech town has developed into a sexual oasis for pedophiles . but although the czech interior ministry admits that child prostitution exists on the border area , officials maintain that the child sex trade is not an organized phenomenon . catherin schauer and ludmilla irmscher beg to differ .
the two social workers -lrb- schauer is from germany , irmscher is czech -rrb- have been working on a community project there since 1994 seeking to protect both children and adults working in the sex industry .

reports from german media hold that children as young as 5 years old are involved with prostitution on the border . the so-called karo project works to help prevent the spread of hiv / aids and other sexually transmitted infections among prostitutes and drug users working in the border region . a mecca for pedophiles the border region between germany and the czech republic has long been developing into something of a mecca for pedophiles . schauer and irmscher say pedophiles travel intentionally to the region where child sex workers are easy to find . that the trade in child prostitutes is still big business is no real surprise in an area which is still very poor .
children from slovakia and the former soviet union are kidnapped then smuggled into the area to work as prostitutes and in many cases mothers will offer their own children up for prostitution , “ effectively selling them to pedophiles ” , schauer says . but there are no easy answers .
although schauer and irmscher look after the children at risk several times a week and report the licence plate numbers of suspicious german cars to the respective authorities that is all they can do .
“ what we ’ re doing at the moment is solely crisis intervention , damage limitation , ” irmscher says . “ we can ’ t just go out onto the streets and take the child away – that would be abduction . ” czech-german cooperation offers hope but closer cooperation between the czech and german authorities may offer more hope in the fight to beat pedophilia in cheb . two years ago , the karo project – which receives eu funding as well as financial support from the family ministry in saxony – joined forces with a larger group set up to fight trafficking in women .
additionally , the saxon authorities have also made progress in the battle , distributing leaflets in the area to raise awareness of the problem . and now , negotiations are under way between the german police in the state of saxony and czech police .

the eastern state of brandenburg had a split vote on the issue , with state labor minister alwin ziel , a social democrat , voting yes , and interior minister jörg schönbohm , a christian democrat , voting no . germany ’ s constitution requires a state to cast a unanimous vote .
at the time , bundesrat president klaus wowereit , a social democrat who is governing mayor of berlin , turned to brandenburg ’ s social democratic premier , manfred stolpe , to decide .
and stolpe voted yes . members of the christian democrats immediately refused to accept the ruling .
and in july , six states government by the opposition party asked the high court to examine the issue . already about 7 million foreigners live in germany , representing about 9 percent of the population .
with more than 4 million germans unemployed , the opposition claims it ’ s no time to be making overtures to new foreign workers . law backers , however , say there are an estimated 1.5 million jobs in germany that germans can ’ t or won ’ t take , thereby making it urgent to open the job market to outsiders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links immigration to germany and the german green card information on how to apply for immigration to germany 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a restrospective of the dancer , actress and film-maker 's comeback since the 1960 ’ s has now opened in bonn at the haus der geschichte , house of history museum , in bonn . ‘ hitler ’ s girl ’ born in 1902 , leni riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and across europe .
due to a knee injury , riefenstahl had to leave dancing , and turned subsequently to film . starting as an actress , she began directing her first films in the 1930 ’ s . it was her first feature film , “ the blue light ” , which attracted the then political rising star adolf hitler ’ s attention .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her with various propaganda films .
her first work , " triumph of will " , a documentation of the nuremberg rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 . the powerful effects of riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made riefenstahl ’ s documentations both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the repressive nazi regime . riefenstahl claims her film " olympia " glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to oust her after the war as " nazi pin-up girl " , " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl " . no politics leni riefenstahl has always denied any involvement in politics .
she has repeatedly underlined that despite her film-making under the nazi 's rule , she was never a member of the party itself .
in addition , she claims she was swept on with the tide of general enthusiasm for adolf hitler , and did not realize what he had been doing until it was too late . since the end of wwii , riefenstahl has contested , and won more than 50 libel suits on her invlovement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
she was cleared of being a nazi , but became a pariah in germany , and left fimmaking for photography . as a photographer and later – after learning to scuba dive at the age of 70 – as an underwater photographer , riefenstahl made eventually made her comeback . desert sands and coral reefs in the folllowing years , riefenstahl travelled to the sudan to photograph the nuba tribe in sudan , documenting the gleaming black , mostly naked bodies of this disappearing tribe in much the same way that she portrayed the athletes ’ bodies during the 1936 olympics . as an underwater photographer she published two books “ the coral gardens ” and “ the wonders under water ” , winning various awards and honours for her work . intense debate according to hermann schäfer , president of the haus der geschichte the decison to hold the restrospective was not made without much intense discussion .
the exhibition , which shows more than 300 exhibits ranging from promotional material from riefenstahl 's short career as a dancer to editing equipment used in her films , runs until 2nd march next year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flirting with controversy leni riefenstahl thrives on controversy .

electricity production in china is a dirty and inefficient business .
but that 's changing .
with the help of german technology and expertise , coal power plants in china are becoming cleaner , greener and more competitive . with a population approaching 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy , china has enormous energy needs .
but although the country 's power sector is the biggest in the world , at current capacity , it ’ s unable to match supply with demand .
most of china 's energy is generated by burning coal , a fossil fuel which produces large quantities of carbon and sulphur dioxide , polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's senior advisor jörg moczadlo -lrb- 2nd from right -rrb- , vice president qi zhiming -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- of shanxi electric power research institute and other chinese engineers discussing the optimization process in power plant shentou no. 2 .
air pollution in chinese cities has become a serious problem , perhaps worse than germany ’ s industrial region experienced in the 1960 ’ s and 70 ’ s , according to dr stefan schmitz , responsible for the energy and transport sector in the german ministry for economic co-operation and development .
" china aims to reduce co2 emissions the same way we did -lrb- in germany -rrb- , by increasing the share of renewable energies , by reducing emission levels in the conventional power sector and introducing filter systems like fluegas desulphuration plants and clean coal technologies , " schmitz told dw radio ’ s peter zimmermann .
china is trying to cap its greenhouse gas emissions another way , with the help of the gtz , germany ’ s development agency .
with measuring vehicles supplied through a german-chinese technical and financial co-operation project , coal power stations across the country are being introduced to sophisticated technology to help them increase efficiency .
hi-tech trucks the fifteen measurement vehicles used in the project are financed with a € 10m loan from germany 's development bank kfw .
the trucks , equipped with high-tech equipment , travel to power plants across china conducting performance optimizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars given by german experts to skilled workers and engineers in china .
jörg moczadlo , who runs the german side of the project , says the chinese engineers are receiving training in germany as well as on the spot in chinese plants , to conduct performance optimizations using appropriate and advanced methods .
" when the project ends , the chinese side should be able to continue by themselves , " moczadlo explains .
" it ’ s very important that they learn better procedures and stick to using them if the project is going to be sustainable . "
bottom line benefit performance optimization in coal power plants means not only reducing co2 emissions , it also means less coal is needed to produce the same amount of electricity .
coal is not cheap in china , and many producers have realized that they can achieve huge cost savings by implementing the gtz ’ s plan .
as well as the main state power corporation , eleven smaller chinese utilities are involved in the project .
but despite its obvious benefits , the vice president of the shanxi power research institute , qi zhiming , says it wasn ’ t easy at first to bring electricity producers in his province around to the idea .
" we tried hard and we ’ re still making every effort to introduce our measuring technology to the important people , " says qi .
" we recently organized a seminar to explain to leading managers how our technical expertise and equipment would pay off with greater efficiency . "
profiting from liberalization in the past , china ’ s energy sector has been highly centralized , and this has made the it inefficient , inflexible and not geared to customers ’ needs .
cost saving is a relatively new idea for china ’ s power producers .
now a process known as ‘ unbundling ’ is taking place .
new companies are being created for generation , transport and distribution , which operate according to the rules of a market economy .
xie yun , a senior engineer with the state power corporation , says the liberalization process has introduced competition into the market .
this has changed the way companies do business .
" since the introduction of competition , power corporations have had to become profit conscious , " says xie .
" companies have to find ways to cut costs and make their product more attractive . "
xie is optimistic about his company ’ s partnership with the gtz , because of the advice and technical support the german agency can provide .
for its part , the german side considers china ’ s participation in the project to be a sign of commitment to tackling the challenges of reforming the country ’ s energy sector and improving the environmental situation .
but the process can not happen overnight .
engineer dr rolf krane says there are still differences in structure and approach .
" before they had a planned economy , and now they are starting to have competition , " says krane .
" now they are having to consider optimizing technology as well as economic and environmental questions , and i think it ’ s very unusual for chinese to have to think about these things . "
growing environmental awareness the measurement vehicle project began in april , 2001 .
germany ’ s federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has indicated that it might be willing to support a second phase .
meanwhile the power companies are hoping that a growing environmental awareness among residents of china ’ s cities will help progress , not hinder it .
the chinese people have become more conscious about environment issues , according to the state power corporation ’ s xie yun .
" we never had a problem building new power plants in the past , " xie explains .
" but today , local neighbourhoods have begun demonstrating in front of properties that have been earmarked .
‘ we don ’ t want a power plant on our doorstep , ’ they say . "
xie hopes that power companies will be able to get the public on side by using more environmentally-friendly technology in fossil fuel power plants .
there are also other ways to solve the problem , says wang ye , the measurement vehicle project manager in china .
" decision-making processes need to be more scientific and efficient , " she says .
" before we demolish our cities and build new buildings , we should be thinking of ways to save energy .
we only have one earth which has existed for much longer than humankind . "

electricity production in china is a dirty and inefficient business .
but that 's changing .
with the help of german technology and expertise , coal power plants in china are becoming cleaner , greener and more competitive . with a population approaching 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy , china has enormous energy needs .
but although the country 's power sector is the biggest in the world , at current capacity , it ’ s unable to match supply with demand .
most of china 's energy is generated by burning coal , a fossil fuel which produces large quantities of carbon and sulphur dioxide , polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's senior advisor jörg moczadlo -lrb- 2nd from right -rrb- , vice president qi zhiming -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- of shanxi electric power research institute and other chinese engineers discussing the optimization process in power plant shentou no. 2 .
air pollution in chinese cities has become a serious problem , perhaps worse than germany ’ s industrial region experienced in the 1960 ’ s and 70 ’ s , according to dr stefan schmitz , responsible for the energy and transport sector in the german ministry for economic co-operation and development .
" china aims to reduce co2 emissions the same way we did -lrb- in germany -rrb- , by increasing the share of renewable energies , by reducing emission levels in the conventional power sector and introducing filter systems like fluegas desulphuration plants and clean coal technologies , " schmitz told dw radio ’ s peter zimmermann .
china is trying to cap its greenhouse gas emissions another way , with the help of the gtz , germany ’ s development agency .
with measuring vehicles supplied through a german-chinese technical and financial co-operation project , coal power stations across the country are being introduced to sophisticated technology to help them increase efficiency .
hi-tech trucks the fifteen measurement vehicles used in the project are financed with a € 10m loan from germany 's development bank kfw .
the trucks , equipped with high-tech equipment , travel to power plants across china conducting performance optimizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars given by german experts to skilled workers and engineers in china .
jörg moczadlo , who runs the german side of the project , says the chinese engineers are receiving training in germany as well as on the spot in chinese plants , to conduct performance optimizations using appropriate and advanced methods .
" when the project ends , the chinese side should be able to continue by themselves , " moczadlo explains .
" it ’ s very important that they learn better procedures and stick to using them if the project is going to be sustainable . "
bottom line benefit performance optimization in coal power plants means not only reducing co2 emissions , it also means less coal is needed to produce the same amount of electricity .
coal is not cheap in china , and many producers have realized that they can achieve huge cost savings by implementing the gtz ’ s plan .
as well as the main state power corporation , eleven smaller chinese utilities are involved in the project .
but despite its obvious benefits , the vice president of the shanxi power research institute , qi zhiming , says it wasn ’ t easy at first to bring electricity producers in his province around to the idea .
" we tried hard and we ’ re still making every effort to introduce our measuring technology to the important people , " says qi .
" we recently organized a seminar to explain to leading managers how our technical expertise and equipment would pay off with greater efficiency . "
profiting from liberalization in the past , china ’ s energy sector has been highly centralized , and this has made the it inefficient , inflexible and not geared to customers ’ needs .
cost saving is a relatively new idea for china ’ s power producers .
now a process known as ‘ unbundling ’ is taking place .
new companies are being created for generation , transport and distribution , which operate according to the rules of a market economy .
xie yun , a senior engineer with the state power corporation , says the liberalization process has introduced competition into the market .
this has changed the way companies do business .
" since the introduction of competition , power corporations have had to become profit conscious , " says xie .
" companies have to find ways to cut costs and make their product more attractive . "
xie is optimistic about his company ’ s partnership with the gtz , because of the advice and technical support the german agency can provide .
for its part , the german side considers china ’ s participation in the project to be a sign of commitment to tackling the challenges of reforming the country ’ s energy sector and improving the environmental situation .
but the process can not happen overnight .
engineer dr rolf krane says there are still differences in structure and approach .
" before they had a planned economy , and now they are starting to have competition , " says krane .
" now they are having to consider optimizing technology as well as economic and environmental questions , and i think it ’ s very unusual for chinese to have to think about these things . "
growing environmental awareness the measurement vehicle project began in april , 2001 .
germany ’ s federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has indicated that it might be willing to support a second phase .
meanwhile the power companies are hoping that a growing environmental awareness among residents of china ’ s cities will help progress , not hinder it .
the chinese people have become more conscious about environment issues , according to the state power corporation ’ s xie yun .
" we never had a problem building new power plants in the past , " xie explains .
" but today , local neighbourhoods have begun demonstrating in front of properties that have been earmarked .
‘ we don ’ t want a power plant on our doorstep , ’ they say . "
xie hopes that power companies will be able to get the public on side by using more environmentally-friendly technology in fossil fuel power plants .
there are also other ways to solve the problem , says wang ye , the measurement vehicle project manager in china .
" decision-making processes need to be more scientific and efficient , " she says .
" before we demolish our cities and build new buildings , we should be thinking of ways to save energy .
we only have one earth which has existed for much longer than humankind . "

electricity production in china is a dirty and inefficient business .
but that 's changing .
with the help of german technology and expertise , coal power plants in china are becoming cleaner , greener and more competitive . with a population approaching 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy , china has enormous energy needs .
but although the country 's power sector is the biggest in the world , at current capacity , it ’ s unable to match supply with demand .
most of china 's energy is generated by burning coal , a fossil fuel which produces large quantities of carbon and sulphur dioxide , polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's senior advisor jörg moczadlo -lrb- 2nd from right -rrb- , vice president qi zhiming -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- of shanxi electric power research institute and other chinese engineers discussing the optimization process in power plant shentou no. 2 .
air pollution in chinese cities has become a serious problem , perhaps worse than germany ’ s industrial region experienced in the 1960 ’ s and 70 ’ s , according to dr stefan schmitz , responsible for the energy and transport sector in the german ministry for economic co-operation and development .
" china aims to reduce co2 emissions the same way we did -lrb- in germany -rrb- , by increasing the share of renewable energies , by reducing emission levels in the conventional power sector and introducing filter systems like fluegas desulphuration plants and clean coal technologies , " schmitz told dw radio ’ s peter zimmermann .
china is trying to cap its greenhouse gas emissions another way , with the help of the gtz , germany ’ s development agency .
with measuring vehicles supplied through a german-chinese technical and financial co-operation project , coal power stations across the country are being introduced to sophisticated technology to help them increase efficiency .
hi-tech trucks the fifteen measurement vehicles used in the project are financed with a € 10m loan from germany 's development bank kfw .
the trucks , equipped with high-tech equipment , travel to power plants across china conducting performance optimizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars given by german experts to skilled workers and engineers in china .
jörg moczadlo , who runs the german side of the project , says the chinese engineers are receiving training in germany as well as on the spot in chinese plants , to conduct performance optimizations using appropriate and advanced methods .
" when the project ends , the chinese side should be able to continue by themselves , " moczadlo explains .
" it ’ s very important that they learn better procedures and stick to using them if the project is going to be sustainable . "
bottom line benefit performance optimization in coal power plants means not only reducing co2 emissions , it also means less coal is needed to produce the same amount of electricity .
coal is not cheap in china , and many producers have realized that they can achieve huge cost savings by implementing the gtz ’ s plan .
as well as the main state power corporation , eleven smaller chinese utilities are involved in the project .
but despite its obvious benefits , the vice president of the shanxi power research institute , qi zhiming , says it wasn ’ t easy at first to bring electricity producers in his province around to the idea .
" we tried hard and we ’ re still making every effort to introduce our measuring technology to the important people , " says qi .
" we recently organized a seminar to explain to leading managers how our technical expertise and equipment would pay off with greater efficiency . "
profiting from liberalization in the past , china ’ s energy sector has been highly centralized , and this has made the it inefficient , inflexible and not geared to customers ’ needs .
cost saving is a relatively new idea for china ’ s power producers .
now a process known as ‘ unbundling ’ is taking place .
new companies are being created for generation , transport and distribution , which operate according to the rules of a market economy .
xie yun , a senior engineer with the state power corporation , says the liberalization process has introduced competition into the market .
this has changed the way companies do business .
" since the introduction of competition , power corporations have had to become profit conscious , " says xie .
" companies have to find ways to cut costs and make their product more attractive . "
xie is optimistic about his company ’ s partnership with the gtz , because of the advice and technical support the german agency can provide .
for its part , the german side considers china ’ s participation in the project to be a sign of commitment to tackling the challenges of reforming the country ’ s energy sector and improving the environmental situation .
but the process can not happen overnight .
engineer dr rolf krane says there are still differences in structure and approach .
" before they had a planned economy , and now they are starting to have competition , " says krane .
" now they are having to consider optimizing technology as well as economic and environmental questions , and i think it ’ s very unusual for chinese to have to think about these things . "
growing environmental awareness the measurement vehicle project began in april , 2001 .
germany ’ s federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has indicated that it might be willing to support a second phase .
meanwhile the power companies are hoping that a growing environmental awareness among residents of china ’ s cities will help progress , not hinder it .
the chinese people have become more conscious about environment issues , according to the state power corporation ’ s xie yun .
" we never had a problem building new power plants in the past , " xie explains .
" but today , local neighbourhoods have begun demonstrating in front of properties that have been earmarked .
‘ we don ’ t want a power plant on our doorstep , ’ they say . "
xie hopes that power companies will be able to get the public on side by using more environmentally-friendly technology in fossil fuel power plants .

electricity production in china is a dirty and inefficient business .
but that 's changing .
with the help of german technology and expertise , coal power plants in china are becoming cleaner , greener and more competitive . with a population approaching 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy , china has enormous energy needs .
but although the country 's power sector is the biggest in the world , at current capacity , it ’ s unable to match supply with demand .
most of china 's energy is generated by burning coal , a fossil fuel which produces large quantities of carbon and sulphur dioxide , polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's senior advisor jörg moczadlo -lrb- 2nd from right -rrb- , vice president qi zhiming -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- of shanxi electric power research institute and other chinese engineers discussing the optimization process in power plant shentou no. 2 .
air pollution in chinese cities has become a serious problem , perhaps worse than germany ’ s industrial region experienced in the 1960 ’ s and 70 ’ s , according to dr stefan schmitz , responsible for the energy and transport sector in the german ministry for economic co-operation and development .
" china aims to reduce co2 emissions the same way we did -lrb- in germany -rrb- , by increasing the share of renewable energies , by reducing emission levels in the conventional power sector and introducing filter systems like fluegas desulphuration plants and clean coal technologies , " schmitz told dw radio ’ s peter zimmermann .
china is trying to cap its greenhouse gas emissions another way , with the help of the gtz , germany ’ s development agency .
with measuring vehicles supplied through a german-chinese technical and financial co-operation project , coal power stations across the country are being introduced to sophisticated technology to help them increase efficiency .
hi-tech trucks the fifteen measurement vehicles used in the project are financed with a € 10m loan from germany 's development bank kfw .
the trucks , equipped with high-tech equipment , travel to power plants across china conducting performance optimizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars given by german experts to skilled workers and engineers in china .
jörg moczadlo , who runs the german side of the project , says the chinese engineers are receiving training in germany as well as on the spot in chinese plants , to conduct performance optimizations using appropriate and advanced methods .
" when the project ends , the chinese side should be able to continue by themselves , " moczadlo explains .
" it ’ s very important that they learn better procedures and stick to using them if the project is going to be sustainable . "
bottom line benefit performance optimization in coal power plants means not only reducing co2 emissions , it also means less coal is needed to produce the same amount of electricity .
coal is not cheap in china , and many producers have realized that they can achieve huge cost savings by implementing the gtz ’ s plan .
as well as the main state power corporation , eleven smaller chinese utilities are involved in the project .
but despite its obvious benefits , the vice president of the shanxi power research institute , qi zhiming , says it wasn ’ t easy at first to bring electricity producers in his province around to the idea .
" we tried hard and we ’ re still making every effort to introduce our measuring technology to the important people , " says qi .
" we recently organized a seminar to explain to leading managers how our technical expertise and equipment would pay off with greater efficiency . "
profiting from liberalization in the past , china ’ s energy sector has been highly centralized , and this has made the it inefficient , inflexible and not geared to customers ’ needs .
cost saving is a relatively new idea for china ’ s power producers .
now a process known as ‘ unbundling ’ is taking place .
new companies are being created for generation , transport and distribution , which operate according to the rules of a market economy .
xie yun , a senior engineer with the state power corporation , says the liberalization process has introduced competition into the market .
this has changed the way companies do business .
" since the introduction of competition , power corporations have had to become profit conscious , " says xie .
" companies have to find ways to cut costs and make their product more attractive . "

" we recently organized a seminar to explain to leading managers how our technical expertise and equipment would pay off with greater efficiency . "
profiting from liberalization in the past , china ’ s energy sector has been highly centralized , and this has made the it inefficient , inflexible and not geared to customers ’ needs .
cost saving is a relatively new idea for china ’ s power producers .
now a process known as ‘ unbundling ’ is taking place .
new companies are being created for generation , transport and distribution , which operate according to the rules of a market economy .
xie yun , a senior engineer with the state power corporation , says the liberalization process has introduced competition into the market .
this has changed the way companies do business .
" since the introduction of competition , power corporations have had to become profit conscious , " says xie .
" companies have to find ways to cut costs and make their product more attractive . "
xie is optimistic about his company ’ s partnership with the gtz , because of the advice and technical support the german agency can provide .
for its part , the german side considers china ’ s participation in the project to be a sign of commitment to tackling the challenges of reforming the country ’ s energy sector and improving the environmental situation .
but the process can not happen overnight .
engineer dr rolf krane says there are still differences in structure and approach .
" before they had a planned economy , and now they are starting to have competition , " says krane .
" now they are having to consider optimizing technology as well as economic and environmental questions , and i think it ’ s very unusual for chinese to have to think about these things . "
growing environmental awareness the measurement vehicle project began in april , 2001 .
germany ’ s federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has indicated that it might be willing to support a second phase .
meanwhile the power companies are hoping that a growing environmental awareness among residents of china ’ s cities will help progress , not hinder it .
the chinese people have become more conscious about environment issues , according to the state power corporation ’ s xie yun .
" we never had a problem building new power plants in the past , " xie explains .
" but today , local neighbourhoods have begun demonstrating in front of properties that have been earmarked .
‘ we don ’ t want a power plant on our doorstep , ’ they say . "
xie hopes that power companies will be able to get the public on side by using more environmentally-friendly technology in fossil fuel power plants .
there are also other ways to solve the problem , says wang ye , the measurement vehicle project manager in china .
" decision-making processes need to be more scientific and efficient , " she says .
" before we demolish our cities and build new buildings , we should be thinking of ways to save energy .
we only have one earth which has existed for much longer than humankind . "

a restrospective of the dancer , actress and film-maker 's comeback since the 1960 ’ s has now opened in bonn at the haus der geschichte , house of history museum , in bonn . ‘ hitler ’ s girl ’ born in 1902 , leni riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and across europe .
due to a knee injury , riefenstahl had to leave dancing , and turned subsequently to film . starting as an actress , she began directing her first films in the 1930 ’ s . it was her first feature film , “ the blue light ” , which attracted the then political rising star adolf hitler ’ s attention .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her with various propaganda films .
her first work , " triumph of will " , a documentation of the nuremberg rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 . the powerful effects of riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made riefenstahl ’ s documentations both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the repressive nazi regime . riefenstahl claims her film " olympia " glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .
but the press continued to oust her after the war as " nazi pin-up girl " , " nazi sympathizer " and " hitler ’ s girl " . no politics leni riefenstahl has always denied any involvement in politics .
she has repeatedly underlined that despite her film-making under the nazi 's rule , she was never a member of the party itself .
in addition , she claims she was swept on with the tide of general enthusiasm for adolf hitler , and did not realize what he had been doing until it was too late . since the end of wwii , riefenstahl has contested , and won more than 50 libel suits on her invlovement with the nazis and the films that were made in that era .
she was cleared of being a nazi , but became a pariah in germany , and left fimmaking for photography . as a photographer and later – after learning to scuba dive at the age of 70 – as an underwater photographer , riefenstahl made eventually made her comeback . desert sands and coral reefs in the folllowing years , riefenstahl travelled to the sudan to photograph the nuba tribe in sudan , documenting the gleaming black , mostly naked bodies of this disappearing tribe in much the same way that she portrayed the athletes ’ bodies during the 1936 olympics . as an underwater photographer she published two books “ the coral gardens ” and “ the wonders under water ” , winning various awards and honours for her work . intense debate according to hermann schäfer , president of the haus der geschichte the decison to hold the restrospective was not made without much intense discussion .
the exhibition , which shows more than 300 exhibits ranging from promotional material from riefenstahl 's short career as a dancer to editing equipment used in her films , runs until 2nd march next year . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de flirting with controversy leni riefenstahl thrives on controversy .

electricity production in china is a dirty and inefficient business .
but that 's changing .
with the help of german technology and expertise , coal power plants in china are becoming cleaner , greener and more competitive . with a population approaching 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy , china has enormous energy needs .
but although the country 's power sector is the biggest in the world , at current capacity , it ’ s unable to match supply with demand .
most of china 's energy is generated by burning coal , a fossil fuel which produces large quantities of carbon and sulphur dioxide , polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's senior advisor jörg moczadlo -lrb- 2nd from right -rrb- , vice president qi zhiming -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- of shanxi electric power research institute and other chinese engineers discussing the optimization process in power plant shentou no. 2 .
air pollution in chinese cities has become a serious problem , perhaps worse than germany ’ s industrial region experienced in the 1960 ’ s and 70 ’ s , according to dr stefan schmitz , responsible for the energy and transport sector in the german ministry for economic co-operation and development .
" china aims to reduce co2 emissions the same way we did -lrb- in germany -rrb- , by increasing the share of renewable energies , by reducing emission levels in the conventional power sector and introducing filter systems like fluegas desulphuration plants and clean coal technologies , " schmitz told dw radio ’ s peter zimmermann .
china is trying to cap its greenhouse gas emissions another way , with the help of the gtz , germany ’ s development agency .
with measuring vehicles supplied through a german-chinese technical and financial co-operation project , coal power stations across the country are being introduced to sophisticated technology to help them increase efficiency .
hi-tech trucks the fifteen measurement vehicles used in the project are financed with a € 10m loan from germany 's development bank kfw .
the trucks , equipped with high-tech equipment , travel to power plants across china conducting performance optimizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars given by german experts to skilled workers and engineers in china .
jörg moczadlo , who runs the german side of the project , says the chinese engineers are receiving training in germany as well as on the spot in chinese plants , to conduct performance optimizations using appropriate and advanced methods .
" when the project ends , the chinese side should be able to continue by themselves , " moczadlo explains .
" it ’ s very important that they learn better procedures and stick to using them if the project is going to be sustainable . "
bottom line benefit performance optimization in coal power plants means not only reducing co2 emissions , it also means less coal is needed to produce the same amount of electricity .
coal is not cheap in china , and many producers have realized that they can achieve huge cost savings by implementing the gtz ’ s plan .
as well as the main state power corporation , eleven smaller chinese utilities are involved in the project .
but despite its obvious benefits , the vice president of the shanxi power research institute , qi zhiming , says it wasn ’ t easy at first to bring electricity producers in his province around to the idea .
" we tried hard and we ’ re still making every effort to introduce our measuring technology to the important people , " says qi .
" we recently organized a seminar to explain to leading managers how our technical expertise and equipment would pay off with greater efficiency . "
profiting from liberalization in the past , china ’ s energy sector has been highly centralized , and this has made the it inefficient , inflexible and not geared to customers ’ needs .
cost saving is a relatively new idea for china ’ s power producers .
now a process known as ‘ unbundling ’ is taking place .
new companies are being created for generation , transport and distribution , which operate according to the rules of a market economy .
xie yun , a senior engineer with the state power corporation , says the liberalization process has introduced competition into the market .
this has changed the way companies do business .
" since the introduction of competition , power corporations have had to become profit conscious , " says xie .
" companies have to find ways to cut costs and make their product more attractive . "
xie is optimistic about his company ’ s partnership with the gtz , because of the advice and technical support the german agency can provide .
for its part , the german side considers china ’ s participation in the project to be a sign of commitment to tackling the challenges of reforming the country ’ s energy sector and improving the environmental situation .
but the process can not happen overnight .
engineer dr rolf krane says there are still differences in structure and approach .
" before they had a planned economy , and now they are starting to have competition , " says krane .
" now they are having to consider optimizing technology as well as economic and environmental questions , and i think it ’ s very unusual for chinese to have to think about these things . "
growing environmental awareness the measurement vehicle project began in april , 2001 .
germany ’ s federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has indicated that it might be willing to support a second phase .
meanwhile the power companies are hoping that a growing environmental awareness among residents of china ’ s cities will help progress , not hinder it .
the chinese people have become more conscious about environment issues , according to the state power corporation ’ s xie yun .
" we never had a problem building new power plants in the past , " xie explains .
" but today , local neighbourhoods have begun demonstrating in front of properties that have been earmarked .
‘ we don ’ t want a power plant on our doorstep , ’ they say . "
xie hopes that power companies will be able to get the public on side by using more environmentally-friendly technology in fossil fuel power plants .
there are also other ways to solve the problem , says wang ye , the measurement vehicle project manager in china .
" decision-making processes need to be more scientific and efficient , " she says .
" before we demolish our cities and build new buildings , we should be thinking of ways to save energy .
we only have one earth which has existed for much longer than humankind . "

electricity production in china is a dirty and inefficient business .
but that 's changing .
with the help of german technology and expertise , coal power plants in china are becoming cleaner , greener and more competitive . with a population approaching 1.3 billion and a fast-growing economy , china has enormous energy needs .
but although the country 's power sector is the biggest in the world , at current capacity , it ’ s unable to match supply with demand .
most of china 's energy is generated by burning coal , a fossil fuel which produces large quantities of carbon and sulphur dioxide , polluting the atmosphere and contributing to global warming .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's senior advisor jörg moczadlo -lrb- 2nd from right -rrb- , vice president qi zhiming -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- of shanxi electric power research institute and other chinese engineers discussing the optimization process in power plant shentou no. 2 .
air pollution in chinese cities has become a serious problem , perhaps worse than germany ’ s industrial region experienced in the 1960 ’ s and 70 ’ s , according to dr stefan schmitz , responsible for the energy and transport sector in the german ministry for economic co-operation and development .
" china aims to reduce co2 emissions the same way we did -lrb- in germany -rrb- , by increasing the share of renewable energies , by reducing emission levels in the conventional power sector and introducing filter systems like fluegas desulphuration plants and clean coal technologies , " schmitz told dw radio ’ s peter zimmermann .
china is trying to cap its greenhouse gas emissions another way , with the help of the gtz , germany ’ s development agency .
with measuring vehicles supplied through a german-chinese technical and financial co-operation project , coal power stations across the country are being introduced to sophisticated technology to help them increase efficiency .
hi-tech trucks the fifteen measurement vehicles used in the project are financed with a € 10m loan from germany 's development bank kfw .
the trucks , equipped with high-tech equipment , travel to power plants across china conducting performance optimizations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seminars given by german experts to skilled workers and engineers in china .
jörg moczadlo , who runs the german side of the project , says the chinese engineers are receiving training in germany as well as on the spot in chinese plants , to conduct performance optimizations using appropriate and advanced methods .
" when the project ends , the chinese side should be able to continue by themselves , " moczadlo explains .
" it ’ s very important that they learn better procedures and stick to using them if the project is going to be sustainable . "
bottom line benefit performance optimization in coal power plants means not only reducing co2 emissions , it also means less coal is needed to produce the same amount of electricity .
coal is not cheap in china , and many producers have realized that they can achieve huge cost savings by implementing the gtz ’ s plan .
as well as the main state power corporation , eleven smaller chinese utilities are involved in the project .
but despite its obvious benefits , the vice president of the shanxi power research institute , qi zhiming , says it wasn ’ t easy at first to bring electricity producers in his province around to the idea .
" we tried hard and we ’ re still making every effort to introduce our measuring technology to the important people , " says qi .
" we recently organized a seminar to explain to leading managers how our technical expertise and equipment would pay off with greater efficiency . "
profiting from liberalization in the past , china ’ s energy sector has been highly centralized , and this has made the it inefficient , inflexible and not geared to customers ’ needs .
cost saving is a relatively new idea for china ’ s power producers .
now a process known as ‘ unbundling ’ is taking place .
new companies are being created for generation , transport and distribution , which operate according to the rules of a market economy .
xie yun , a senior engineer with the state power corporation , says the liberalization process has introduced competition into the market .
this has changed the way companies do business .
" since the introduction of competition , power corporations have had to become profit conscious , " says xie .
" companies have to find ways to cut costs and make their product more attractive . "
xie is optimistic about his company ’ s partnership with the gtz , because of the advice and technical support the german agency can provide .
for its part , the german side considers china ’ s participation in the project to be a sign of commitment to tackling the challenges of reforming the country ’ s energy sector and improving the environmental situation .
but the process can not happen overnight .
engineer dr rolf krane says there are still differences in structure and approach .
" before they had a planned economy , and now they are starting to have competition , " says krane .
" now they are having to consider optimizing technology as well as economic and environmental questions , and i think it ’ s very unusual for chinese to have to think about these things . "
growing environmental awareness the measurement vehicle project began in april , 2001 .
germany ’ s federal ministry for economic co-operation and development -lrb- bmz -rrb- has indicated that it might be willing to support a second phase .
meanwhile the power companies are hoping that a growing environmental awareness among residents of china ’ s cities will help progress , not hinder it .
the chinese people have become more conscious about environment issues , according to the state power corporation ’ s xie yun .
" we never had a problem building new power plants in the past , " xie explains .
" but today , local neighbourhoods have begun demonstrating in front of properties that have been earmarked .
‘ we don ’ t want a power plant on our doorstep , ’ they say . "
xie hopes that power companies will be able to get the public on side by using more environmentally-friendly technology in fossil fuel power plants .
there are also other ways to solve the problem , says wang ye , the measurement vehicle project manager in china .
" decision-making processes need to be more scientific and efficient , " she says .
" before we demolish our cities and build new buildings , we should be thinking of ways to save energy .
we only have one earth which has existed for much longer than humankind . "

but with the help of german technology , one municipality near sao paolo has developed better ways to dispose of its garbage . in sao paolo , a city of around twenty million people , stinking landfills reach heights of up to eighty metres .
fluids which seep through contaminate the groundwater , posing a serious health threat .
many of these waste dumps are in danger of collapsing .
all over brazil , uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills provide a meagre living to waste-pickers who scavenge in the piles of rotting garbage .
but in the town of sao sebastiao , near sao paolo , the tips , and the waste-pickers , have vanished .
in their place the town boasts one of the cleanest and neatest landfill sites in latin america .
changed lives the lives of the former waste-pickers have changed dramatically .
many people who used to spend long days sifting through rubbish out in the open , knee-deep in filth , are now employed sorting marketable waste at a recycling co-operative near the town centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the recycling co-operative sao sebastiao , brazil .
the co-operative was set up with the help of the german development agency gtz .
it has trained staff in the fundamentals of waste sorting and provided them with a computer system , with which members can check the current prices of materials such as glass and paper online .
the recycling co-operative is headed by edleuza vlinaia santos , a former waste-picker .
santos now has accounting skills .
she says the gtz trained her and the staff at the centre to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic .
as santos told dw radio 's john hay , the atmosphere in the centre is much more harmonious now that the workers are no longer competing with one another for their survival .
" we really are better off than we used to be .
we work peacefully together , and we don ’ t fight amongst ourselves .
now that we all receive regular wages , we do n't have to worry so much . "
a model partnership gtz , as well as helping to found sao sebastiao 's recycling co-operative , has also supported a program to improve storage and processing techniques , making the municipality a model of good waste management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern waste dump in sao sebastiao .
sao sebastiao 's landfill is no longer an eyesore .
and it also smells better , thanks to a public-private partnership between the municipality , a brazilian company that collects and transports waste to the landfill site , and the german company faber .
several decades ago , faber developed a technique known as ‘ mechanical-biological treatment ’ in which waste decomposes in carefully ventilated rotting heaps .
" we trialled these processes in germany during the 1960s , " says wolfgang tönges , faber ’ s managing director .
" it makes a compelling reason to buy our products , when people realise they can jump several developmental steps and avoid making the same mistakes that were made in europe . "
hi-tech waste management uncontrolled , untreated household waste takes up to four hundred years to decompose fully .
during this time , it emits fluids which contaminate ground water , as well as harmful methane gas .
mechanical-biological treatment reduces the time of decomposition to twelve months or less .
almost no methane is produced .
the waste heaps are keep off the ground with plastic sheeting to avoid contamination of the ground water .
the addition of small amounts of bacteria contained in water collected at the base of the dumps helps the rotting material to decompose quickly .
the heaps of rotting waste consist of several layers , separated by wooden pallets to ensure proper ventilation .
the top layer of each pile - the biofilter - consists of wood chips , resembling a forest floor and giving an overall impression of orderliness .
global markets like ninety percent of municipalities in brazil , most developing countries and emerging economies have uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills , creating a sizeable market for faber ’ s expertise .
more landfills using german technology are planned in several countries including mexico , south africa and mozambique .
proper management of these sites will improve the health and well-being of the residents as well as helping to preserve their environmental resources for the future .
reduce , re-use , recycle recycling is an effective way to reduce the quantity of waste for disposal .
and hi-tech landfills can help keep the environment clean .
but it ’ s also important to avoid producing waste in the first place , according to gtz advisor dieter munz .
" we have to look at the beginning of the process , as well as the end , " munz says .
" that means we also have to look at co-operating with supermarkets , to tackle the problem of waste creation much earlier . "

over centuries , high fuel consumption in traditional ceramics production has contributed to serious environmental problems , including pollution , deforestation and soil erosion .
" there are hardly any forests left , " says the gtz 's peter bock in hanoi .
" most of the hard wood used here now is imported from neighbouring countries like laos and cambodia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old vietnamese pottery kiln dirty business in north vietnam , most ceramics producers have switched from wood to coal in the past few decades .
in many northern villages , like bat trang near hanoi , this has led to severe air pollution . the ancient town 's unsealed roads are covered in black dust from the coal kilns , and a smoky haze hangs in the air .
going green with gas improving conditions in villages like bat trang was one incentive for the german development agency gtz to get involved , introducing new technology which has made ceramics production throughout vietnam much more efficient , and less of an environmental hazard .
a number of vietnamese companies had already begun to import cleaner gas kilns from taiwan and japan , but these were expensive , and operation costs were too high .
gtz 's gas kiln , which uses high-tech fibre mats , is cheaper and more energy efficient , and can be built locally .
as the head fireman at the minh duc factory near saigon , le hong hung told dw radio 's anke rasper , it 's also cleaner , cooler and easier to operate .
" the new kilns are less smoky , everything is very clean .
and the work environment around the kiln is much cooler .
we also get a much better quality product . "
for the export market , a fast delivery time and good quality are essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women working in a vietnamese ceramic factory the gas kilns also cut labour costs .
fewer people are needed to operate several gas kilns than are required to work on a single traditional ' dragon ' kiln .
firing takes only half a day instead of up to a week .
environmental damage is also significantly reduced , because burning gas emits a fraction of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- of wood or coal .
simply hi-tech ceramics expert and gtz consultant bernd pfannkuche designed the gas kilns , which have also been introduced in the philippines and thailand .
he says his design combines the most sophisticated fibre material on the market with steel and other locally available materials .
" we used a firing system that was developed in germany in the middle ages for wood kilns , but it ’ s adapted to the conditions needed for a modern gas kiln , " pfannkuche says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's new gas kiln the german design has not been patented and so is available to everyone .
in the past two years , vietnamese engineers have improved on the prototype first constructed in saigon by gtz together with the state-owned vietnamese company vinaceglass .
efficiency costs despite their efficiency advantages , gtz 's gas kilns are still more expensive than their wood- and coal-fired predecessors .
depending on the size , the price for one of gtz 's kilns is between 15,000 and 35,000 dollars .
the final costs are usually even higher , says company owner nguyen van minh .
" in addition to the investment for the kiln itself , we have to pay for a gas tank too , so we can store gas , " he says .
" together with kiln equipment , that brings the cost up to about usd50,000 . "
the vietnamese government has tried to help , granting cheap credits to factories investing in energy-efficient technology .
it has also introduced regulations prohibiting the use of wood as an energy source in new factories .
the good news for ceramics producers is that gas has become more affordable since large deposits of lpg were discovered off the vietnamese coast in the south china sea .
with new gas pipelines under construction , prices are expected to fall even further .
in the next decade , the entire ceramics industry in vietnam , comprising more than a thousand factories , is expected to switch to gas technology .
the country 's ceramics are set to become even more competitive in international markets . all the same , many producers say they 'll keep at least one of their dragon kilns , for old times ' sake .

but with the help of german technology , one municipality near sao paolo has developed better ways to dispose of its garbage . in sao paolo , a city of around twenty million people , stinking landfills reach heights of up to eighty metres .
fluids which seep through contaminate the groundwater , posing a serious health threat .
many of these waste dumps are in danger of collapsing .
all over brazil , uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills provide a meagre living to waste-pickers who scavenge in the piles of rotting garbage .
but in the town of sao sebastiao , near sao paolo , the tips , and the waste-pickers , have vanished .
in their place the town boasts one of the cleanest and neatest landfill sites in latin america .
changed lives the lives of the former waste-pickers have changed dramatically .
many people who used to spend long days sifting through rubbish out in the open , knee-deep in filth , are now employed sorting marketable waste at a recycling co-operative near the town centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the recycling co-operative sao sebastiao , brazil .
the co-operative was set up with the help of the german development agency gtz .
it has trained staff in the fundamentals of waste sorting and provided them with a computer system , with which members can check the current prices of materials such as glass and paper online .
the recycling co-operative is headed by edleuza vlinaia santos , a former waste-picker .
santos now has accounting skills .
she says the gtz trained her and the staff at the centre to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic .
as santos told dw radio 's john hay , the atmosphere in the centre is much more harmonious now that the workers are no longer competing with one another for their survival .
" we really are better off than we used to be .
we work peacefully together , and we don ’ t fight amongst ourselves .
now that we all receive regular wages , we do n't have to worry so much . "
a model partnership gtz , as well as helping to found sao sebastiao 's recycling co-operative , has also supported a program to improve storage and processing techniques , making the municipality a model of good waste management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern waste dump in sao sebastiao .
sao sebastiao 's landfill is no longer an eyesore .
and it also smells better , thanks to a public-private partnership between the municipality , a brazilian company that collects and transports waste to the landfill site , and the german company faber .
several decades ago , faber developed a technique known as ‘ mechanical-biological treatment ’ in which waste decomposes in carefully ventilated rotting heaps .
" we trialled these processes in germany during the 1960s , " says wolfgang tönges , faber ’ s managing director .
" it makes a compelling reason to buy our products , when people realise they can jump several developmental steps and avoid making the same mistakes that were made in europe . "
hi-tech waste management uncontrolled , untreated household waste takes up to four hundred years to decompose fully .
during this time , it emits fluids which contaminate ground water , as well as harmful methane gas .
mechanical-biological treatment reduces the time of decomposition to twelve months or less .
almost no methane is produced .
the waste heaps are keep off the ground with plastic sheeting to avoid contamination of the ground water .
the addition of small amounts of bacteria contained in water collected at the base of the dumps helps the rotting material to decompose quickly .
the heaps of rotting waste consist of several layers , separated by wooden pallets to ensure proper ventilation .
the top layer of each pile - the biofilter - consists of wood chips , resembling a forest floor and giving an overall impression of orderliness .
global markets like ninety percent of municipalities in brazil , most developing countries and emerging economies have uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills , creating a sizeable market for faber ’ s expertise .
more landfills using german technology are planned in several countries including mexico , south africa and mozambique .
proper management of these sites will improve the health and well-being of the residents as well as helping to preserve their environmental resources for the future .
reduce , re-use , recycle recycling is an effective way to reduce the quantity of waste for disposal .
and hi-tech landfills can help keep the environment clean .
but it ’ s also important to avoid producing waste in the first place , according to gtz advisor dieter munz .
" we have to look at the beginning of the process , as well as the end , " munz says .
" that means we also have to look at co-operating with supermarkets , to tackle the problem of waste creation much earlier . "

now , thanks to the popularity of more efficient gas kilns , vietnamese exports to europe , australia and japan are claiming a growing slice of the market . many old-style pottery kilns still operating throughout vietnam use large quantities of wood , coal or rice husks .
over centuries , high fuel consumption in traditional ceramics production has contributed to serious environmental problems , including pollution , deforestation and soil erosion .
" there are hardly any forests left , " says the gtz 's peter bock in hanoi .
" most of the hard wood used here now is imported from neighbouring countries like laos and cambodia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old vietnamese pottery kiln dirty business in north vietnam , most ceramics producers have switched from wood to coal in the past few decades .
in many northern villages , like bat trang near hanoi , this has led to severe air pollution . the ancient town 's unsealed roads are covered in black dust from the coal kilns , and a smoky haze hangs in the air .
going green with gas improving conditions in villages like bat trang was one incentive for the german development agency gtz to get involved , introducing new technology which has made ceramics production throughout vietnam much more efficient , and less of an environmental hazard .
a number of vietnamese companies had already begun to import cleaner gas kilns from taiwan and japan , but these were expensive , and operation costs were too high .
gtz 's gas kiln , which uses high-tech fibre mats , is cheaper and more energy efficient , and can be built locally .
as the head fireman at the minh duc factory near saigon , le hong hung told dw radio 's anke rasper , it 's also cleaner , cooler and easier to operate .
" the new kilns are less smoky , everything is very clean .
and the work environment around the kiln is much cooler .
we also get a much better quality product . "
for the export market , a fast delivery time and good quality are essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women working in a vietnamese ceramic factory the gas kilns also cut labour costs .
fewer people are needed to operate several gas kilns than are required to work on a single traditional ' dragon ' kiln .
firing takes only half a day instead of up to a week .
environmental damage is also significantly reduced , because burning gas emits a fraction of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- of wood or coal .
simply hi-tech ceramics expert and gtz consultant bernd pfannkuche designed the gas kilns , which have also been introduced in the philippines and thailand .
he says his design combines the most sophisticated fibre material on the market with steel and other locally available materials .
" we used a firing system that was developed in germany in the middle ages for wood kilns , but it ’ s adapted to the conditions needed for a modern gas kiln , " pfannkuche says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's new gas kiln the german design has not been patented and so is available to everyone .
in the past two years , vietnamese engineers have improved on the prototype first constructed in saigon by gtz together with the state-owned vietnamese company vinaceglass .
efficiency costs despite their efficiency advantages , gtz 's gas kilns are still more expensive than their wood- and coal-fired predecessors .
depending on the size , the price for one of gtz 's kilns is between 15,000 and 35,000 dollars .
the final costs are usually even higher , says company owner nguyen van minh .
" in addition to the investment for the kiln itself , we have to pay for a gas tank too , so we can store gas , " he says .
" together with kiln equipment , that brings the cost up to about usd50,000 . "
the vietnamese government has tried to help , granting cheap credits to factories investing in energy-efficient technology .
it has also introduced regulations prohibiting the use of wood as an energy source in new factories .
the good news for ceramics producers is that gas has become more affordable since large deposits of lpg were discovered off the vietnamese coast in the south china sea .
with new gas pipelines under construction , prices are expected to fall even further .
in the next decade , the entire ceramics industry in vietnam , comprising more than a thousand factories , is expected to switch to gas technology .
the country 's ceramics are set to become even more competitive in international markets . all the same , many producers say they 'll keep at least one of their dragon kilns , for old times ' sake .

but with the help of german technology , one municipality near sao paolo has developed better ways to dispose of its garbage . in sao paolo , a city of around twenty million people , stinking landfills reach heights of up to eighty metres .
fluids which seep through contaminate the groundwater , posing a serious health threat .
many of these waste dumps are in danger of collapsing .
all over brazil , uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills provide a meagre living to waste-pickers who scavenge in the piles of rotting garbage .
but in the town of sao sebastiao , near sao paolo , the tips , and the waste-pickers , have vanished .
in their place the town boasts one of the cleanest and neatest landfill sites in latin america .
changed lives the lives of the former waste-pickers have changed dramatically .
many people who used to spend long days sifting through rubbish out in the open , knee-deep in filth , are now employed sorting marketable waste at a recycling co-operative near the town centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the recycling co-operative sao sebastiao , brazil .
the co-operative was set up with the help of the german development agency gtz .
it has trained staff in the fundamentals of waste sorting and provided them with a computer system , with which members can check the current prices of materials such as glass and paper online .
the recycling co-operative is headed by edleuza vlinaia santos , a former waste-picker .
santos now has accounting skills .
she says the gtz trained her and the staff at the centre to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic .
as santos told dw radio 's john hay , the atmosphere in the centre is much more harmonious now that the workers are no longer competing with one another for their survival .
" we really are better off than we used to be .
we work peacefully together , and we don ’ t fight amongst ourselves .
now that we all receive regular wages , we do n't have to worry so much . "
a model partnership gtz , as well as helping to found sao sebastiao 's recycling co-operative , has also supported a program to improve storage and processing techniques , making the municipality a model of good waste management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern waste dump in sao sebastiao .
sao sebastiao 's landfill is no longer an eyesore .
and it also smells better , thanks to a public-private partnership between the municipality , a brazilian company that collects and transports waste to the landfill site , and the german company faber .
several decades ago , faber developed a technique known as ‘ mechanical-biological treatment ’ in which waste decomposes in carefully ventilated rotting heaps .
" we trialled these processes in germany during the 1960s , " says wolfgang tönges , faber ’ s managing director .
" it makes a compelling reason to buy our products , when people realise they can jump several developmental steps and avoid making the same mistakes that were made in europe . "
hi-tech waste management uncontrolled , untreated household waste takes up to four hundred years to decompose fully .
during this time , it emits fluids which contaminate ground water , as well as harmful methane gas .
mechanical-biological treatment reduces the time of decomposition to twelve months or less .
almost no methane is produced .
the waste heaps are keep off the ground with plastic sheeting to avoid contamination of the ground water .
the addition of small amounts of bacteria contained in water collected at the base of the dumps helps the rotting material to decompose quickly .
the heaps of rotting waste consist of several layers , separated by wooden pallets to ensure proper ventilation .
the top layer of each pile - the biofilter - consists of wood chips , resembling a forest floor and giving an overall impression of orderliness .
global markets like ninety percent of municipalities in brazil , most developing countries and emerging economies have uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills , creating a sizeable market for faber ’ s expertise .
more landfills using german technology are planned in several countries including mexico , south africa and mozambique .
proper management of these sites will improve the health and well-being of the residents as well as helping to preserve their environmental resources for the future .
reduce , re-use , recycle recycling is an effective way to reduce the quantity of waste for disposal .
and hi-tech landfills can help keep the environment clean .
but it ’ s also important to avoid producing waste in the first place , according to gtz advisor dieter munz .
" we have to look at the beginning of the process , as well as the end , " munz says .
" that means we also have to look at co-operating with supermarkets , to tackle the problem of waste creation much earlier . "

but with the help of german technology , one municipality near sao paolo has developed better ways to dispose of its garbage . in sao paolo , a city of around twenty million people , stinking landfills reach heights of up to eighty metres .
fluids which seep through contaminate the groundwater , posing a serious health threat .
many of these waste dumps are in danger of collapsing .
all over brazil , uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills provide a meagre living to waste-pickers who scavenge in the piles of rotting garbage .
but in the town of sao sebastiao , near sao paolo , the tips , and the waste-pickers , have vanished .
in their place the town boasts one of the cleanest and neatest landfill sites in latin america .
changed lives the lives of the former waste-pickers have changed dramatically .
many people who used to spend long days sifting through rubbish out in the open , knee-deep in filth , are now employed sorting marketable waste at a recycling co-operative near the town centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the recycling co-operative sao sebastiao , brazil .
the co-operative was set up with the help of the german development agency gtz .
it has trained staff in the fundamentals of waste sorting and provided them with a computer system , with which members can check the current prices of materials such as glass and paper online .
the recycling co-operative is headed by edleuza vlinaia santos , a former waste-picker .
santos now has accounting skills .
she says the gtz trained her and the staff at the centre to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic .
as santos told dw radio 's john hay , the atmosphere in the centre is much more harmonious now that the workers are no longer competing with one another for their survival .
" we really are better off than we used to be .
we work peacefully together , and we don ’ t fight amongst ourselves .
now that we all receive regular wages , we do n't have to worry so much . "
a model partnership gtz , as well as helping to found sao sebastiao 's recycling co-operative , has also supported a program to improve storage and processing techniques , making the municipality a model of good waste management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern waste dump in sao sebastiao .
sao sebastiao 's landfill is no longer an eyesore .
and it also smells better , thanks to a public-private partnership between the municipality , a brazilian company that collects and transports waste to the landfill site , and the german company faber .
several decades ago , faber developed a technique known as ‘ mechanical-biological treatment ’ in which waste decomposes in carefully ventilated rotting heaps .
" we trialled these processes in germany during the 1960s , " says wolfgang tönges , faber ’ s managing director .
" it makes a compelling reason to buy our products , when people realise they can jump several developmental steps and avoid making the same mistakes that were made in europe . "
hi-tech waste management uncontrolled , untreated household waste takes up to four hundred years to decompose fully .
during this time , it emits fluids which contaminate ground water , as well as harmful methane gas .
mechanical-biological treatment reduces the time of decomposition to twelve months or less .
almost no methane is produced .
the waste heaps are keep off the ground with plastic sheeting to avoid contamination of the ground water .
the addition of small amounts of bacteria contained in water collected at the base of the dumps helps the rotting material to decompose quickly .
the heaps of rotting waste consist of several layers , separated by wooden pallets to ensure proper ventilation .
the top layer of each pile - the biofilter - consists of wood chips , resembling a forest floor and giving an overall impression of orderliness .
global markets like ninety percent of municipalities in brazil , most developing countries and emerging economies have uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills , creating a sizeable market for faber ’ s expertise .
more landfills using german technology are planned in several countries including mexico , south africa and mozambique .
proper management of these sites will improve the health and well-being of the residents as well as helping to preserve their environmental resources for the future .
reduce , re-use , recycle recycling is an effective way to reduce the quantity of waste for disposal .
and hi-tech landfills can help keep the environment clean .
but it ’ s also important to avoid producing waste in the first place , according to gtz advisor dieter munz .
" we have to look at the beginning of the process , as well as the end , " munz says .
" that means we also have to look at co-operating with supermarkets , to tackle the problem of waste creation much earlier . "

now , thanks to the popularity of more efficient gas kilns , vietnamese exports to europe , australia and japan are claiming a growing slice of the market . many old-style pottery kilns still operating throughout vietnam use large quantities of wood , coal or rice husks .
over centuries , high fuel consumption in traditional ceramics production has contributed to serious environmental problems , including pollution , deforestation and soil erosion .
" there are hardly any forests left , " says the gtz 's peter bock in hanoi .
" most of the hard wood used here now is imported from neighbouring countries like laos and cambodia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old vietnamese pottery kiln dirty business in north vietnam , most ceramics producers have switched from wood to coal in the past few decades .
in many northern villages , like bat trang near hanoi , this has led to severe air pollution . the ancient town 's unsealed roads are covered in black dust from the coal kilns , and a smoky haze hangs in the air .
going green with gas improving conditions in villages like bat trang was one incentive for the german development agency gtz to get involved , introducing new technology which has made ceramics production throughout vietnam much more efficient , and less of an environmental hazard .
a number of vietnamese companies had already begun to import cleaner gas kilns from taiwan and japan , but these were expensive , and operation costs were too high .
gtz 's gas kiln , which uses high-tech fibre mats , is cheaper and more energy efficient , and can be built locally .
as the head fireman at the minh duc factory near saigon , le hong hung told dw radio 's anke rasper , it 's also cleaner , cooler and easier to operate .
" the new kilns are less smoky , everything is very clean .
and the work environment around the kiln is much cooler .
we also get a much better quality product . "
for the export market , a fast delivery time and good quality are essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women working in a vietnamese ceramic factory the gas kilns also cut labour costs .
fewer people are needed to operate several gas kilns than are required to work on a single traditional ' dragon ' kiln .
firing takes only half a day instead of up to a week .
environmental damage is also significantly reduced , because burning gas emits a fraction of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- of wood or coal .
simply hi-tech ceramics expert and gtz consultant bernd pfannkuche designed the gas kilns , which have also been introduced in the philippines and thailand .
he says his design combines the most sophisticated fibre material on the market with steel and other locally available materials .
" we used a firing system that was developed in germany in the middle ages for wood kilns , but it ’ s adapted to the conditions needed for a modern gas kiln , " pfannkuche says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's new gas kiln the german design has not been patented and so is available to everyone .
in the past two years , vietnamese engineers have improved on the prototype first constructed in saigon by gtz together with the state-owned vietnamese company vinaceglass .
efficiency costs despite their efficiency advantages , gtz 's gas kilns are still more expensive than their wood- and coal-fired predecessors .
depending on the size , the price for one of gtz 's kilns is between 15,000 and 35,000 dollars .
the final costs are usually even higher , says company owner nguyen van minh .
" in addition to the investment for the kiln itself , we have to pay for a gas tank too , so we can store gas , " he says .
" together with kiln equipment , that brings the cost up to about usd50,000 . "
the vietnamese government has tried to help , granting cheap credits to factories investing in energy-efficient technology .
it has also introduced regulations prohibiting the use of wood as an energy source in new factories .
the good news for ceramics producers is that gas has become more affordable since large deposits of lpg were discovered off the vietnamese coast in the south china sea .
with new gas pipelines under construction , prices are expected to fall even further .
in the next decade , the entire ceramics industry in vietnam , comprising more than a thousand factories , is expected to switch to gas technology .
the country 's ceramics are set to become even more competitive in international markets . all the same , many producers say they 'll keep at least one of their dragon kilns , for old times ' sake .

but with the help of german technology , one municipality near sao paolo has developed better ways to dispose of its garbage . in sao paolo , a city of around twenty million people , stinking landfills reach heights of up to eighty metres .
fluids which seep through contaminate the groundwater , posing a serious health threat .
many of these waste dumps are in danger of collapsing .
all over brazil , uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills provide a meagre living to waste-pickers who scavenge in the piles of rotting garbage .
but in the town of sao sebastiao , near sao paolo , the tips , and the waste-pickers , have vanished .
in their place the town boasts one of the cleanest and neatest landfill sites in latin america .
changed lives the lives of the former waste-pickers have changed dramatically .
many people who used to spend long days sifting through rubbish out in the open , knee-deep in filth , are now employed sorting marketable waste at a recycling co-operative near the town centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the recycling co-operative sao sebastiao , brazil .
the co-operative was set up with the help of the german development agency gtz .
it has trained staff in the fundamentals of waste sorting and provided them with a computer system , with which members can check the current prices of materials such as glass and paper online .
the recycling co-operative is headed by edleuza vlinaia santos , a former waste-picker .
santos now has accounting skills .
she says the gtz trained her and the staff at the centre to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic .
as santos told dw radio 's john hay , the atmosphere in the centre is much more harmonious now that the workers are no longer competing with one another for their survival .
" we really are better off than we used to be .
we work peacefully together , and we don ’ t fight amongst ourselves .
now that we all receive regular wages , we do n't have to worry so much . "
a model partnership gtz , as well as helping to found sao sebastiao 's recycling co-operative , has also supported a program to improve storage and processing techniques , making the municipality a model of good waste management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern waste dump in sao sebastiao .
sao sebastiao 's landfill is no longer an eyesore .
and it also smells better , thanks to a public-private partnership between the municipality , a brazilian company that collects and transports waste to the landfill site , and the german company faber .
several decades ago , faber developed a technique known as ‘ mechanical-biological treatment ’ in which waste decomposes in carefully ventilated rotting heaps .
" we trialled these processes in germany during the 1960s , " says wolfgang tönges , faber ’ s managing director .
" it makes a compelling reason to buy our products , when people realise they can jump several developmental steps and avoid making the same mistakes that were made in europe . "
hi-tech waste management uncontrolled , untreated household waste takes up to four hundred years to decompose fully .
during this time , it emits fluids which contaminate ground water , as well as harmful methane gas .
mechanical-biological treatment reduces the time of decomposition to twelve months or less .
almost no methane is produced .
the waste heaps are keep off the ground with plastic sheeting to avoid contamination of the ground water .
the addition of small amounts of bacteria contained in water collected at the base of the dumps helps the rotting material to decompose quickly .
the heaps of rotting waste consist of several layers , separated by wooden pallets to ensure proper ventilation .
the top layer of each pile - the biofilter - consists of wood chips , resembling a forest floor and giving an overall impression of orderliness .
global markets like ninety percent of municipalities in brazil , most developing countries and emerging economies have uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills , creating a sizeable market for faber ’ s expertise .
more landfills using german technology are planned in several countries including mexico , south africa and mozambique .
proper management of these sites will improve the health and well-being of the residents as well as helping to preserve their environmental resources for the future .
reduce , re-use , recycle recycling is an effective way to reduce the quantity of waste for disposal .
and hi-tech landfills can help keep the environment clean .
but it ’ s also important to avoid producing waste in the first place , according to gtz advisor dieter munz .
" we have to look at the beginning of the process , as well as the end , " munz says .
" that means we also have to look at co-operating with supermarkets , to tackle the problem of waste creation much earlier . "

now , thanks to the popularity of more efficient gas kilns , vietnamese exports to europe , australia and japan are claiming a growing slice of the market . many old-style pottery kilns still operating throughout vietnam use large quantities of wood , coal or rice husks .
over centuries , high fuel consumption in traditional ceramics production has contributed to serious environmental problems , including pollution , deforestation and soil erosion .
" there are hardly any forests left , " says the gtz 's peter bock in hanoi .
" most of the hard wood used here now is imported from neighbouring countries like laos and cambodia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old vietnamese pottery kiln dirty business in north vietnam , most ceramics producers have switched from wood to coal in the past few decades .
in many northern villages , like bat trang near hanoi , this has led to severe air pollution . the ancient town 's unsealed roads are covered in black dust from the coal kilns , and a smoky haze hangs in the air .
going green with gas improving conditions in villages like bat trang was one incentive for the german development agency gtz to get involved , introducing new technology which has made ceramics production throughout vietnam much more efficient , and less of an environmental hazard .
a number of vietnamese companies had already begun to import cleaner gas kilns from taiwan and japan , but these were expensive , and operation costs were too high .
gtz 's gas kiln , which uses high-tech fibre mats , is cheaper and more energy efficient , and can be built locally .
as the head fireman at the minh duc factory near saigon , le hong hung told dw radio 's anke rasper , it 's also cleaner , cooler and easier to operate .
" the new kilns are less smoky , everything is very clean .
and the work environment around the kiln is much cooler .
we also get a much better quality product . "
for the export market , a fast delivery time and good quality are essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women working in a vietnamese ceramic factory the gas kilns also cut labour costs .
fewer people are needed to operate several gas kilns than are required to work on a single traditional ' dragon ' kiln .
firing takes only half a day instead of up to a week .
environmental damage is also significantly reduced , because burning gas emits a fraction of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- of wood or coal .
simply hi-tech ceramics expert and gtz consultant bernd pfannkuche designed the gas kilns , which have also been introduced in the philippines and thailand .
he says his design combines the most sophisticated fibre material on the market with steel and other locally available materials .
" we used a firing system that was developed in germany in the middle ages for wood kilns , but it ’ s adapted to the conditions needed for a modern gas kiln , " pfannkuche says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's new gas kiln the german design has not been patented and so is available to everyone .
in the past two years , vietnamese engineers have improved on the prototype first constructed in saigon by gtz together with the state-owned vietnamese company vinaceglass .
efficiency costs despite their efficiency advantages , gtz 's gas kilns are still more expensive than their wood- and coal-fired predecessors .
depending on the size , the price for one of gtz 's kilns is between 15,000 and 35,000 dollars .
the final costs are usually even higher , says company owner nguyen van minh .
" in addition to the investment for the kiln itself , we have to pay for a gas tank too , so we can store gas , " he says .
" together with kiln equipment , that brings the cost up to about usd50,000 . "
the vietnamese government has tried to help , granting cheap credits to factories investing in energy-efficient technology .
it has also introduced regulations prohibiting the use of wood as an energy source in new factories .
the good news for ceramics producers is that gas has become more affordable since large deposits of lpg were discovered off the vietnamese coast in the south china sea .
with new gas pipelines under construction , prices are expected to fall even further .
in the next decade , the entire ceramics industry in vietnam , comprising more than a thousand factories , is expected to switch to gas technology .
the country 's ceramics are set to become even more competitive in international markets . all the same , many producers say they 'll keep at least one of their dragon kilns , for old times ' sake .

the small czech town has developed into a sexual oasis for pedophiles . but although the czech interior ministry admits that child prostitution exists on the border area , officials maintain that the child sex trade is not an organized phenomenon . catherin schauer and ludmilla irmscher beg to differ .
the two social workers -lrb- schauer is from germany , irmscher is czech -rrb- have been working on a community project there since 1994 seeking to protect both children and adults working in the sex industry .
reports from german media hold that children as young as 5 years old are involved with prostitution on the border . the so-called karo project works to help prevent the spread of hiv / aids and other sexually transmitted infections among prostitutes and drug users working in the border region . a mecca for pedophiles the border region between germany and the czech republic has long been developing into something of a mecca for pedophiles . schauer and irmscher say pedophiles travel intentionally to the region where child sex workers are easy to find . that the trade in child prostitutes is still big business is no real surprise in an area which is still very poor .
children from slovakia and the former soviet union are kidnapped then smuggled into the area to work as prostitutes and in many cases mothers will offer their own children up for prostitution , “ effectively selling them to pedophiles ” , schauer says . but there are no easy answers .
although schauer and irmscher look after the children at risk several times a week and report the licence plate numbers of suspicious german cars to the respective authorities that is all they can do .
“ what we ’ re doing at the moment is solely crisis intervention , damage limitation , ” irmscher says . “ we can ’ t just go out onto the streets and take the child away – that would be abduction . ” czech-german cooperation offers hope but closer cooperation between the czech and german authorities may offer more hope in the fight to beat pedophilia in cheb . two years ago , the karo project – which receives eu funding as well as financial support from the family ministry in saxony – joined forces with a larger group set up to fight trafficking in women .
additionally , the saxon authorities have also made progress in the battle , distributing leaflets in the area to raise awareness of the problem . and now , negotiations are under way between the german police in the state of saxony and czech police .

under the agreement reached tuesday , there is also a provision for incremental tax and social services contributions for those earning between 400 and 800 euros a month .

he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her with various propaganda films .
her first work , " triumph of will " , a documentation of the nuremberg rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 . the powerful effects of riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made riefenstahl ’ s documentations both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the repressive nazi regime . riefenstahl claims her film " olympia " glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .

on wednesday , the court is expected to announce its decision . germany ’ s highest court is expected to release on wednesday its verdict on the country ’ s first-ever immigration law , which was approved by the upper legislative chamber in march with the help of political manuevering that was later called into question by the conservative opposition . the law , introduced by the governing coalition formed by the social democrats and the greens , is aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits thereby making it easier for foreigners to live and work in germany . the law also lays out measures for helping foreigners fit into german society , ranging from language to citizenship courses .
it is set to take effect jan .
1 , 2003 , if upheld by the constitutional court in karlsruhe . the dispute over the law stems from a march decision by the bundesrat , which represents the states on national matters and thus considers various issues addressed by the national parliament .
the eastern state of brandenburg had a split vote on the issue , with state labor minister alwin ziel , a social democrat , voting yes , and interior minister jörg schönbohm , a christian democrat , voting no . germany ’ s constitution requires a state to cast a unanimous vote .
at the time , bundesrat president klaus wowereit , a social democrat who is governing mayor of berlin , turned to brandenburg ’ s social democratic premier , manfred stolpe , to decide .
and stolpe voted yes . members of the christian democrats immediately refused to accept the ruling .
and in july , six states government by the opposition party asked the high court to examine the issue . already about 7 million foreigners live in germany , representing about 9 percent of the population .
with more than 4 million germans unemployed , the opposition claims it ’ s no time to be making overtures to new foreign workers . law backers , however , say there are an estimated 1.5 million jobs in germany that germans can ’ t or won ’ t take , thereby making it urgent to open the job market to outsiders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links immigration to germany and the german green card information on how to apply for immigration to germany radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a restrospective of the dancer , actress and film-maker 's comeback since the 1960 ’ s has now opened in bonn at the haus der geschichte , house of history museum , in bonn . ‘ hitler ’ s girl ’ born in 1902 , leni riefenstahl started out as a dancer , performing both in germany and across europe .
due to a knee injury , riefenstahl had to leave dancing , and turned subsequently to film . starting as an actress , she began directing her first films in the 1930 ’ s . it was her first feature film , “ the blue light ” , which attracted the then political rising star adolf hitler ’ s attention .
he was so intrigued by her work that he summoned her to a baltic seaside resort where he commissioned her with various propaganda films .
her first work , " triumph of will " , a documentation of the nuremberg rally , was later followed by a film on the berlin olympics in 1936 . the powerful effects of riefenstahl ’ s pioneering film techniques , including lifts installed in the swastika-bearing flagpoles at the 1936 olympics to enable vertical tracking shots , made riefenstahl ’ s documentations both powerful and disturbing glorifications of the repressive nazi regime . riefenstahl claims her film " olympia " glorified the human form purely for aesthetic reasons , and did not , as critics claim , put the aryan race on a pedestal .

now , thanks to the popularity of more efficient gas kilns , vietnamese exports to europe , australia and japan are claiming a growing slice of the market . many old-style pottery kilns still operating throughout vietnam use large quantities of wood , coal or rice husks .
over centuries , high fuel consumption in traditional ceramics production has contributed to serious environmental problems , including pollution , deforestation and soil erosion .
" there are hardly any forests left , " says the gtz 's peter bock in hanoi .
" most of the hard wood used here now is imported from neighbouring countries like laos and cambodia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old vietnamese pottery kiln dirty business in north vietnam , most ceramics producers have switched from wood to coal in the past few decades .
in many northern villages , like bat trang near hanoi , this has led to severe air pollution . the ancient town 's unsealed roads are covered in black dust from the coal kilns , and a smoky haze hangs in the air .
going green with gas improving conditions in villages like bat trang was one incentive for the german development agency gtz to get involved , introducing new technology which has made ceramics production throughout vietnam much more efficient , and less of an environmental hazard .
a number of vietnamese companies had already begun to import cleaner gas kilns from taiwan and japan , but these were expensive , and operation costs were too high .
gtz 's gas kiln , which uses high-tech fibre mats , is cheaper and more energy efficient , and can be built locally .
as the head fireman at the minh duc factory near saigon , le hong hung told dw radio 's anke rasper , it 's also cleaner , cooler and easier to operate .
" the new kilns are less smoky , everything is very clean .
and the work environment around the kiln is much cooler .
we also get a much better quality product . "
for the export market , a fast delivery time and good quality are essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women working in a vietnamese ceramic factory the gas kilns also cut labour costs .
fewer people are needed to operate several gas kilns than are required to work on a single traditional ' dragon ' kiln .
firing takes only half a day instead of up to a week .
environmental damage is also significantly reduced , because burning gas emits a fraction of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- of wood or coal .
simply hi-tech ceramics expert and gtz consultant bernd pfannkuche designed the gas kilns , which have also been introduced in the philippines and thailand .
he says his design combines the most sophisticated fibre material on the market with steel and other locally available materials .
" we used a firing system that was developed in germany in the middle ages for wood kilns , but it ’ s adapted to the conditions needed for a modern gas kiln , " pfannkuche says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's new gas kiln the german design has not been patented and so is available to everyone .
in the past two years , vietnamese engineers have improved on the prototype first constructed in saigon by gtz together with the state-owned vietnamese company vinaceglass .
efficiency costs despite their efficiency advantages , gtz 's gas kilns are still more expensive than their wood- and coal-fired predecessors .
depending on the size , the price for one of gtz 's kilns is between 15,000 and 35,000 dollars .
the final costs are usually even higher , says company owner nguyen van minh .
" in addition to the investment for the kiln itself , we have to pay for a gas tank too , so we can store gas , " he says .
" together with kiln equipment , that brings the cost up to about usd50,000 . "
the vietnamese government has tried to help , granting cheap credits to factories investing in energy-efficient technology .
it has also introduced regulations prohibiting the use of wood as an energy source in new factories .
the good news for ceramics producers is that gas has become more affordable since large deposits of lpg were discovered off the vietnamese coast in the south china sea .
with new gas pipelines under construction , prices are expected to fall even further .
in the next decade , the entire ceramics industry in vietnam , comprising more than a thousand factories , is expected to switch to gas technology .
the country 's ceramics are set to become even more competitive in international markets . all the same , many producers say they 'll keep at least one of their dragon kilns , for old times ' sake .

in many northern villages , like bat trang near hanoi , this has led to severe air pollution . the ancient town 's unsealed roads are covered in black dust from the coal kilns , and a smoky haze hangs in the air .
going green with gas improving conditions in villages like bat trang was one incentive for the german development agency gtz to get involved , introducing new technology which has made ceramics production throughout vietnam much more efficient , and less of an environmental hazard .
a number of vietnamese companies had already begun to import cleaner gas kilns from taiwan and japan , but these were expensive , and operation costs were too high .
gtz 's gas kiln , which uses high-tech fibre mats , is cheaper and more energy efficient , and can be built locally .
as the head fireman at the minh duc factory near saigon , le hong hung told dw radio 's anke rasper , it 's also cleaner , cooler and easier to operate .
" the new kilns are less smoky , everything is very clean .
and the work environment around the kiln is much cooler .
we also get a much better quality product . "
for the export market , a fast delivery time and good quality are essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women working in a vietnamese ceramic factory the gas kilns also cut labour costs .
fewer people are needed to operate several gas kilns than are required to work on a single traditional ' dragon ' kiln .
firing takes only half a day instead of up to a week .
environmental damage is also significantly reduced , because burning gas emits a fraction of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- of wood or coal .
simply hi-tech ceramics expert and gtz consultant bernd pfannkuche designed the gas kilns , which have also been introduced in the philippines and thailand .
he says his design combines the most sophisticated fibre material on the market with steel and other locally available materials .
" we used a firing system that was developed in germany in the middle ages for wood kilns , but it ’ s adapted to the conditions needed for a modern gas kiln , " pfannkuche says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's new gas kiln the german design has not been patented and so is available to everyone .
in the past two years , vietnamese engineers have improved on the prototype first constructed in saigon by gtz together with the state-owned vietnamese company vinaceglass .
efficiency costs despite their efficiency advantages , gtz 's gas kilns are still more expensive than their wood- and coal-fired predecessors .
depending on the size , the price for one of gtz 's kilns is between 15,000 and 35,000 dollars .
the final costs are usually even higher , says company owner nguyen van minh .
" in addition to the investment for the kiln itself , we have to pay for a gas tank too , so we can store gas , " he says .
" together with kiln equipment , that brings the cost up to about usd50,000 . "
the vietnamese government has tried to help , granting cheap credits to factories investing in energy-efficient technology .
it has also introduced regulations prohibiting the use of wood as an energy source in new factories .
the good news for ceramics producers is that gas has become more affordable since large deposits of lpg were discovered off the vietnamese coast in the south china sea .
with new gas pipelines under construction , prices are expected to fall even further .
in the next decade , the entire ceramics industry in vietnam , comprising more than a thousand factories , is expected to switch to gas technology .
the country 's ceramics are set to become even more competitive in international markets . all the same , many producers say they 'll keep at least one of their dragon kilns , for old times ' sake .

but with the help of german technology , one municipality near sao paolo has developed better ways to dispose of its garbage . in sao paolo , a city of around twenty million people , stinking landfills reach heights of up to eighty metres .
fluids which seep through contaminate the groundwater , posing a serious health threat .
many of these waste dumps are in danger of collapsing .
all over brazil , uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills provide a meagre living to waste-pickers who scavenge in the piles of rotting garbage .
but in the town of sao sebastiao , near sao paolo , the tips , and the waste-pickers , have vanished .
in their place the town boasts one of the cleanest and neatest landfill sites in latin america .
changed lives the lives of the former waste-pickers have changed dramatically .
many people who used to spend long days sifting through rubbish out in the open , knee-deep in filth , are now employed sorting marketable waste at a recycling co-operative near the town centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the recycling co-operative sao sebastiao , brazil .
the co-operative was set up with the help of the german development agency gtz .
it has trained staff in the fundamentals of waste sorting and provided them with a computer system , with which members can check the current prices of materials such as glass and paper online .
the recycling co-operative is headed by edleuza vlinaia santos , a former waste-picker .
santos now has accounting skills .
she says the gtz trained her and the staff at the centre to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic .
as santos told dw radio 's john hay , the atmosphere in the centre is much more harmonious now that the workers are no longer competing with one another for their survival .
" we really are better off than we used to be .
we work peacefully together , and we don ’ t fight amongst ourselves .
now that we all receive regular wages , we do n't have to worry so much . "
a model partnership gtz , as well as helping to found sao sebastiao 's recycling co-operative , has also supported a program to improve storage and processing techniques , making the municipality a model of good waste management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern waste dump in sao sebastiao .
sao sebastiao 's landfill is no longer an eyesore .
and it also smells better , thanks to a public-private partnership between the municipality , a brazilian company that collects and transports waste to the landfill site , and the german company faber .
several decades ago , faber developed a technique known as ‘ mechanical-biological treatment ’ in which waste decomposes in carefully ventilated rotting heaps .
" we trialled these processes in germany during the 1960s , " says wolfgang tönges , faber ’ s managing director .
" it makes a compelling reason to buy our products , when people realise they can jump several developmental steps and avoid making the same mistakes that were made in europe . "
hi-tech waste management uncontrolled , untreated household waste takes up to four hundred years to decompose fully .
during this time , it emits fluids which contaminate ground water , as well as harmful methane gas .
mechanical-biological treatment reduces the time of decomposition to twelve months or less .
almost no methane is produced .
the waste heaps are keep off the ground with plastic sheeting to avoid contamination of the ground water .
the addition of small amounts of bacteria contained in water collected at the base of the dumps helps the rotting material to decompose quickly .
the heaps of rotting waste consist of several layers , separated by wooden pallets to ensure proper ventilation .
the top layer of each pile - the biofilter - consists of wood chips , resembling a forest floor and giving an overall impression of orderliness .
global markets like ninety percent of municipalities in brazil , most developing countries and emerging economies have uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills , creating a sizeable market for faber ’ s expertise .
more landfills using german technology are planned in several countries including mexico , south africa and mozambique .
proper management of these sites will improve the health and well-being of the residents as well as helping to preserve their environmental resources for the future .
reduce , re-use , recycle recycling is an effective way to reduce the quantity of waste for disposal .
and hi-tech landfills can help keep the environment clean .
but it ’ s also important to avoid producing waste in the first place , according to gtz advisor dieter munz .
" we have to look at the beginning of the process , as well as the end , " munz says .
" that means we also have to look at co-operating with supermarkets , to tackle the problem of waste creation much earlier . "

but with the help of german technology , one municipality near sao paolo has developed better ways to dispose of its garbage . in sao paolo , a city of around twenty million people , stinking landfills reach heights of up to eighty metres .
fluids which seep through contaminate the groundwater , posing a serious health threat .
many of these waste dumps are in danger of collapsing .
all over brazil , uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills provide a meagre living to waste-pickers who scavenge in the piles of rotting garbage .
but in the town of sao sebastiao , near sao paolo , the tips , and the waste-pickers , have vanished .
in their place the town boasts one of the cleanest and neatest landfill sites in latin america .
changed lives the lives of the former waste-pickers have changed dramatically .
many people who used to spend long days sifting through rubbish out in the open , knee-deep in filth , are now employed sorting marketable waste at a recycling co-operative near the town centre .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the recycling co-operative sao sebastiao , brazil .
the co-operative was set up with the help of the german development agency gtz .
it has trained staff in the fundamentals of waste sorting and provided them with a computer system , with which members can check the current prices of materials such as glass and paper online .
the recycling co-operative is headed by edleuza vlinaia santos , a former waste-picker .
santos now has accounting skills .
she says the gtz trained her and the staff at the centre to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic .
as santos told dw radio 's john hay , the atmosphere in the centre is much more harmonious now that the workers are no longer competing with one another for their survival .
" we really are better off than we used to be .
we work peacefully together , and we don ’ t fight amongst ourselves .
now that we all receive regular wages , we do n't have to worry so much . "
a model partnership gtz , as well as helping to found sao sebastiao 's recycling co-operative , has also supported a program to improve storage and processing techniques , making the municipality a model of good waste management .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modern waste dump in sao sebastiao .
sao sebastiao 's landfill is no longer an eyesore .
and it also smells better , thanks to a public-private partnership between the municipality , a brazilian company that collects and transports waste to the landfill site , and the german company faber .
several decades ago , faber developed a technique known as ‘ mechanical-biological treatment ’ in which waste decomposes in carefully ventilated rotting heaps .
" we trialled these processes in germany during the 1960s , " says wolfgang tönges , faber ’ s managing director .
" it makes a compelling reason to buy our products , when people realise they can jump several developmental steps and avoid making the same mistakes that were made in europe . "
hi-tech waste management uncontrolled , untreated household waste takes up to four hundred years to decompose fully .
during this time , it emits fluids which contaminate ground water , as well as harmful methane gas .
mechanical-biological treatment reduces the time of decomposition to twelve months or less .
almost no methane is produced .
the waste heaps are keep off the ground with plastic sheeting to avoid contamination of the ground water .
the addition of small amounts of bacteria contained in water collected at the base of the dumps helps the rotting material to decompose quickly .
the heaps of rotting waste consist of several layers , separated by wooden pallets to ensure proper ventilation .
the top layer of each pile - the biofilter - consists of wood chips , resembling a forest floor and giving an overall impression of orderliness .
global markets like ninety percent of municipalities in brazil , most developing countries and emerging economies have uncontrolled waste dumps and landfills , creating a sizeable market for faber ’ s expertise .
more landfills using german technology are planned in several countries including mexico , south africa and mozambique .
proper management of these sites will improve the health and well-being of the residents as well as helping to preserve their environmental resources for the future .
reduce , re-use , recycle recycling is an effective way to reduce the quantity of waste for disposal .
and hi-tech landfills can help keep the environment clean .
but it ’ s also important to avoid producing waste in the first place , according to gtz advisor dieter munz .
" we have to look at the beginning of the process , as well as the end , " munz says .
" that means we also have to look at co-operating with supermarkets , to tackle the problem of waste creation much earlier . "

now , thanks to the popularity of more efficient gas kilns , vietnamese exports to europe , australia and japan are claiming a growing slice of the market . many old-style pottery kilns still operating throughout vietnam use large quantities of wood , coal or rice husks .
over centuries , high fuel consumption in traditional ceramics production has contributed to serious environmental problems , including pollution , deforestation and soil erosion .
" there are hardly any forests left , " says the gtz 's peter bock in hanoi .
" most of the hard wood used here now is imported from neighbouring countries like laos and cambodia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old vietnamese pottery kiln dirty business in north vietnam , most ceramics producers have switched from wood to coal in the past few decades .
in many northern villages , like bat trang near hanoi , this has led to severe air pollution . the ancient town 's unsealed roads are covered in black dust from the coal kilns , and a smoky haze hangs in the air .
going green with gas improving conditions in villages like bat trang was one incentive for the german development agency gtz to get involved , introducing new technology which has made ceramics production throughout vietnam much more efficient , and less of an environmental hazard .
a number of vietnamese companies had already begun to import cleaner gas kilns from taiwan and japan , but these were expensive , and operation costs were too high .
gtz 's gas kiln , which uses high-tech fibre mats , is cheaper and more energy efficient , and can be built locally .
as the head fireman at the minh duc factory near saigon , le hong hung told dw radio 's anke rasper , it 's also cleaner , cooler and easier to operate .
" the new kilns are less smoky , everything is very clean .
and the work environment around the kiln is much cooler .
we also get a much better quality product . "
for the export market , a fast delivery time and good quality are essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women working in a vietnamese ceramic factory the gas kilns also cut labour costs .
fewer people are needed to operate several gas kilns than are required to work on a single traditional ' dragon ' kiln .
firing takes only half a day instead of up to a week .
environmental damage is also significantly reduced , because burning gas emits a fraction of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- of wood or coal .
simply hi-tech ceramics expert and gtz consultant bernd pfannkuche designed the gas kilns , which have also been introduced in the philippines and thailand .
he says his design combines the most sophisticated fibre material on the market with steel and other locally available materials .
" we used a firing system that was developed in germany in the middle ages for wood kilns , but it ’ s adapted to the conditions needed for a modern gas kiln , " pfannkuche says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's new gas kiln the german design has not been patented and so is available to everyone .
in the past two years , vietnamese engineers have improved on the prototype first constructed in saigon by gtz together with the state-owned vietnamese company vinaceglass .
efficiency costs despite their efficiency advantages , gtz 's gas kilns are still more expensive than their wood- and coal-fired predecessors .
depending on the size , the price for one of gtz 's kilns is between 15,000 and 35,000 dollars .
the final costs are usually even higher , says company owner nguyen van minh .
" in addition to the investment for the kiln itself , we have to pay for a gas tank too , so we can store gas , " he says .
" together with kiln equipment , that brings the cost up to about usd50,000 . "
the vietnamese government has tried to help , granting cheap credits to factories investing in energy-efficient technology .
it has also introduced regulations prohibiting the use of wood as an energy source in new factories .
the good news for ceramics producers is that gas has become more affordable since large deposits of lpg were discovered off the vietnamese coast in the south china sea .
with new gas pipelines under construction , prices are expected to fall even further .
in the next decade , the entire ceramics industry in vietnam , comprising more than a thousand factories , is expected to switch to gas technology .
the country 's ceramics are set to become even more competitive in international markets . all the same , many producers say they 'll keep at least one of their dragon kilns , for old times ' sake .

now , thanks to the popularity of more efficient gas kilns , vietnamese exports to europe , australia and japan are claiming a growing slice of the market . many old-style pottery kilns still operating throughout vietnam use large quantities of wood , coal or rice husks .
over centuries , high fuel consumption in traditional ceramics production has contributed to serious environmental problems , including pollution , deforestation and soil erosion .
" there are hardly any forests left , " says the gtz 's peter bock in hanoi .
" most of the hard wood used here now is imported from neighbouring countries like laos and cambodia . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old vietnamese pottery kiln dirty business in north vietnam , most ceramics producers have switched from wood to coal in the past few decades .
in many northern villages , like bat trang near hanoi , this has led to severe air pollution . the ancient town 's unsealed roads are covered in black dust from the coal kilns , and a smoky haze hangs in the air .
going green with gas improving conditions in villages like bat trang was one incentive for the german development agency gtz to get involved , introducing new technology which has made ceramics production throughout vietnam much more efficient , and less of an environmental hazard .
a number of vietnamese companies had already begun to import cleaner gas kilns from taiwan and japan , but these were expensive , and operation costs were too high .
gtz 's gas kiln , which uses high-tech fibre mats , is cheaper and more energy efficient , and can be built locally .
as the head fireman at the minh duc factory near saigon , le hong hung told dw radio 's anke rasper , it 's also cleaner , cooler and easier to operate .
" the new kilns are less smoky , everything is very clean .
and the work environment around the kiln is much cooler .
we also get a much better quality product . "
for the export market , a fast delivery time and good quality are essential .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women working in a vietnamese ceramic factory the gas kilns also cut labour costs .
fewer people are needed to operate several gas kilns than are required to work on a single traditional ' dragon ' kiln .
firing takes only half a day instead of up to a week .
environmental damage is also significantly reduced , because burning gas emits a fraction of the carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- of wood or coal .
simply hi-tech ceramics expert and gtz consultant bernd pfannkuche designed the gas kilns , which have also been introduced in the philippines and thailand .
he says his design combines the most sophisticated fibre material on the market with steel and other locally available materials .
" we used a firing system that was developed in germany in the middle ages for wood kilns , but it ’ s adapted to the conditions needed for a modern gas kiln , " pfannkuche says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gtz 's new gas kiln the german design has not been patented and so is available to everyone .
in the past two years , vietnamese engineers have improved on the prototype first constructed in saigon by gtz together with the state-owned vietnamese company vinaceglass .
efficiency costs despite their efficiency advantages , gtz 's gas kilns are still more expensive than their wood- and coal-fired predecessors .
depending on the size , the price for one of gtz 's kilns is between 15,000 and 35,000 dollars .
the final costs are usually even higher , says company owner nguyen van minh .
" in addition to the investment for the kiln itself , we have to pay for a gas tank too , so we can store gas , " he says .
" together with kiln equipment , that brings the cost up to about usd50,000 . "
the vietnamese government has tried to help , granting cheap credits to factories investing in energy-efficient technology .
it has also introduced regulations prohibiting the use of wood as an energy source in new factories .
the good news for ceramics producers is that gas has become more affordable since large deposits of lpg were discovered off the vietnamese coast in the south china sea .
with new gas pipelines under construction , prices are expected to fall even further .
in the next decade , the entire ceramics industry in vietnam , comprising more than a thousand factories , is expected to switch to gas technology .
the country 's ceramics are set to become even more competitive in international markets . all the same , many producers say they 'll keep at least one of their dragon kilns , for old times ' sake .

on wednesday , the court is expected to announce its decision . germany ’ s highest court is expected to release on wednesday its verdict on the country ’ s first-ever immigration law , which was approved by the upper legislative chamber in march with the help of political manuevering that was later called into question by the conservative opposition . the law , introduced by the governing coalition formed by the social democrats and the greens , is aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits thereby making it easier for foreigners to live and work in germany . the law also lays out measures for helping foreigners fit into german society , ranging from language to citizenship courses .
it is set to take effect jan .
1 , 2003 , if upheld by the constitutional court in karlsruhe . the dispute over the law stems from a march decision by the bundesrat , which represents the states on national matters and thus considers various issues addressed by the national parliament .
the eastern state of brandenburg had a split vote on the issue , with state labor minister alwin ziel , a social democrat , voting yes , and interior minister jörg schönbohm , a christian democrat , voting no . germany ’ s constitution requires a state to cast a unanimous vote .
at the time , bundesrat president klaus wowereit , a social democrat who is governing mayor of berlin , turned to brandenburg ’ s social democratic premier , manfred stolpe , to decide .
and stolpe voted yes . members of the christian democrats immediately refused to accept the ruling .
and in july , six states government by the opposition party asked the high court to examine the issue . already about 7 million foreigners live in germany , representing about 9 percent of the population .
with more than 4 million germans unemployed , the opposition claims it ’ s no time to be making overtures to new foreign workers . law backers , however , say there are an estimated 1.5 million jobs in germany that germans can ’ t or won ’ t take , thereby making it urgent to open the job market to outsiders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links immigration to germany and the german green card information on how to apply for immigration to germany 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.12.2002 sex business on the border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social workers are trying to stop child prostitution on the czech-german border the czech republic – set to join the eu in 2004 – has a problem with child prostitution along its border with germany . cheb , a small town in the czech republic and a stone ’ s throw away from the borders of saxony and bavaria , has a nasty secret .
the small czech town has developed into a sexual oasis for pedophiles . but although the czech interior ministry admits that child prostitution exists on the border area , officials maintain that the child sex trade is not an organized phenomenon . catherin schauer and ludmilla irmscher beg to differ .
the two social workers -lrb- schauer is from germany , irmscher is czech -rrb- have been working on a community project there since 1994 seeking to protect both children and adults working in the sex industry .
reports from german media hold that children as young as 5 years old are involved with prostitution on the border . the so-called karo project works to help prevent the spread of hiv / aids and other sexually transmitted infections among prostitutes and drug users working in the border region . a mecca for pedophiles the border region between germany and the czech republic has long been developing into something of a mecca for pedophiles . schauer and irmscher say pedophiles travel intentionally to the region where child sex workers are easy to find . that the trade in child prostitutes is still big business is no real surprise in an area which is still very poor .
children from slovakia and the former soviet union are kidnapped then smuggled into the area to work as prostitutes and in many cases mothers will offer their own children up for prostitution , “ effectively selling them to pedophiles ” , schauer says . but there are no easy answers .
although schauer and irmscher look after the children at risk several times a week and report the licence plate numbers of suspicious german cars to the respective authorities that is all they can do .

the small czech town has developed into a sexual oasis for pedophiles . but although the czech interior ministry admits that child prostitution exists on the border area , officials maintain that the child sex trade is not an organized phenomenon . catherin schauer and ludmilla irmscher beg to differ .
the two social workers -lrb- schauer is from germany , irmscher is czech -rrb- have been working on a community project there since 1994 seeking to protect both children and adults working in the sex industry .
reports from german media hold that children as young as 5 years old are involved with prostitution on the border . the so-called karo project works to help prevent the spread of hiv / aids and other sexually transmitted infections among prostitutes and drug users working in the border region . a mecca for pedophiles the border region between germany and the czech republic has long been developing into something of a mecca for pedophiles . schauer and irmscher say pedophiles travel intentionally to the region where child sex workers are easy to find . that the trade in child prostitutes is still big business is no real surprise in an area which is still very poor .
children from slovakia and the former soviet union are kidnapped then smuggled into the area to work as prostitutes and in many cases mothers will offer their own children up for prostitution , “ effectively selling them to pedophiles ” , schauer says . but there are no easy answers .
although schauer and irmscher look after the children at risk several times a week and report the licence plate numbers of suspicious german cars to the respective authorities that is all they can do .

on wednesday , the court is expected to announce its decision . germany ’ s highest court is expected to release on wednesday its verdict on the country ’ s first-ever immigration law , which was approved by the upper legislative chamber in march with the help of political manuevering that was later called into question by the conservative opposition . the law , introduced by the governing coalition formed by the social democrats and the greens , is aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits thereby making it easier for foreigners to live and work in germany . the law also lays out measures for helping foreigners fit into german society , ranging from language to citizenship courses .
it is set to take effect jan .
1 , 2003 , if upheld by the constitutional court in karlsruhe . the dispute over the law stems from a march decision by the bundesrat , which represents the states on national matters and thus considers various issues addressed by the national parliament .
the eastern state of brandenburg had a split vote on the issue , with state labor minister alwin ziel , a social democrat , voting yes , and interior minister jörg schönbohm , a christian democrat , voting no . germany ’ s constitution requires a state to cast a unanimous vote .
at the time , bundesrat president klaus wowereit , a social democrat who is governing mayor of berlin , turned to brandenburg ’ s social democratic premier , manfred stolpe , to decide .
and stolpe voted yes . members of the christian democrats immediately refused to accept the ruling .
and in july , six states government by the opposition party asked the high court to examine the issue . already about 7 million foreigners live in germany , representing about 9 percent of the population .
with more than 4 million germans unemployed , the opposition claims it ’ s no time to be making overtures to new foreign workers . law backers , however , say there are an estimated 1.5 million jobs in germany that germans can ’ t or won ’ t take , thereby making it urgent to open the job market to outsiders . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links immigration to germany and the german green card information on how to apply for immigration to germany 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the small czech town has developed into a sexual oasis for pedophiles . but although the czech interior ministry admits that child prostitution exists on the border area , officials maintain that the child sex trade is not an organized phenomenon . catherin schauer and ludmilla irmscher beg to differ .
the two social workers -lrb- schauer is from germany , irmscher is czech -rrb- have been working on a community project there since 1994 seeking to protect both children and adults working in the sex industry .
reports from german media hold that children as young as 5 years old are involved with prostitution on the border . the so-called karo project works to help prevent the spread of hiv / aids and other sexually transmitted infections among prostitutes and drug users working in the border region . a mecca for pedophiles the border region between germany and the czech republic has long been developing into something of a mecca for pedophiles . schauer and irmscher say pedophiles travel intentionally to the region where child sex workers are easy to find . that the trade in child prostitutes is still big business is no real surprise in an area which is still very poor .
children from slovakia and the former soviet union are kidnapped then smuggled into the area to work as prostitutes and in many cases mothers will offer their own children up for prostitution , “ effectively selling them to pedophiles ” , schauer says . but there are no easy answers .
although schauer and irmscher look after the children at risk several times a week and report the licence plate numbers of suspicious german cars to the respective authorities that is all they can do .
“ what we ’ re doing at the moment is solely crisis intervention , damage limitation , ” irmscher says . “ we can ’ t just go out onto the streets and take the child away – that would be abduction . ” czech-german cooperation offers hope but closer cooperation between the czech and german authorities may offer more hope in the fight to beat pedophilia in cheb . two years ago , the karo project – which receives eu funding as well as financial support from the family ministry in saxony – joined forces with a larger group set up to fight trafficking in women .
additionally , the saxon authorities have also made progress in the battle , distributing leaflets in the area to raise awareness of the problem . and now , negotiations are under way between the german police in the state of saxony and czech police .
horst rasch , the interior minister in saxony said the new cooperation would “ enable us to follow up the people who are engaging in this criminal activity . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the opposition conservatives blocked a bill providing for reform in the low-pay job sector last month .
but a joint mediation committee of the bundesrat upper house , where the conservatives have a majority , and the bundestag , reached an agreement on tuesday for raising the pay threshold at which employees have to pay tax and social benefits from 325 to 400 euros .
the bill will be considered by the bundesrat on friday , but is expected to pass without significant opposition .
german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement said the bill would cost the government 1 billion euros in lost revenue .
but the law , which would take effect in april , is also expected to create more than 300,000 jobs .
with more than 4 million people unemployed in germany , job creation – even of the low-paying kind – is an important concern across the political spectrum .
under the agreement reached tuesday , there is also a provision for incremental tax and social services contributions for those earning between 400 and 800 euros a month .
issue of temporary workers still controversial however , another central aspect of the job reform package presented by the commission led by volkswagen executive peter hartz and comprising of representatives from industry , unions , science and politics , still remains unresolved .
the issue of payment of temporary workers has sparked controversy .
the proposed reforms call for the right to pay temporary workers less money than their full-time counterparts .
german unions have stepped in to oppose this aspect of the reform package and the future of this provision remains uncertain . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's temp work plan faces challenge the government 's plan to promote temporary work for its close to four million unemployed is facing considerable criticism in parliament .

bbc news online guides you through all the key events from the fellowship of the ring .
the lord of the rings trilogy is set within a world known as middle-earth , a land made up of humans , elves and dwarves and creatures such as orcs , dragons and trolls .
tolkien 's world , adapted from generations of folklore , fairytale and mythology may not be original but it has been the template for countless fantasy novels since .
the saga is essentially split into three books , the fellowship of the ring , the two towers and the return of the king .
the good guys frodo gandalf aragorn legolas gimli merry pippin click to read a review of the two towers like almost all such books the focus of the trilogy is a quest .
in this case , the quest is to destroy a ring of power , which , if it fell into the wrong hands , would bring about the destruction of all that is good and kind in the world .
the quest is entrusted to a hobbit , a race of creatures whose horizons do not usually extend further than the next pint of ale or good pipe of tobacco .
the ring is in the keep of frodo baggins of the shire , who was given it by his cousin bilbo baggins , who stumbled upon the artefact during a separate quest -lrb- which is covered in the book the hobbit -rrb- .
frodo baggins is instructed to destroy the ring by the wizard gandalf , a wandering magician who has aided and advised the powers of good for generations .
the only way to destroy the ring is to melt it in the fires of mordor , where the magical device was created .
evil stronghold unfortunately , mordor also happens to be the stronghold of sauron , the evil figure who wants to destroy all of middle-earth and whose agents are hell bent on crushing the races of the land .
apart from the onerous task of carrying the ring to mordor there is a greater peril - the ring has a poisonous effect on whoever bears it , twisting the soul , infecting the heart .
for frodo the journey to carry the ring is not just a test of endurance but also a test of his goodness .
middle-earth mordor - domain of sauron rivendell - home of the elves rohan - human kingdom gondor - human kingdom shire - home of the hobbits isengard - home of saruman to undertake the journey frodo is accompanied by fellow hobbits sam , pippin and merry .
he is also aided by a small band of heroes - the humans aragorn and boromir , a dwarf gimli , and the elf legolas .
their fellowship is the basis of tolkien 's first book in the trilogy .
you may think it odd that the fate of the world is put in the hands of such an inauspicious creature as frodo .
but because of the peril connected to the ring , few are willing to undertake the journey .
the hope is that such a small and unassuming creature will go unnoticed by the vast forces of darkness .
epic backdrop the quest is the focus of the trilogy but tolkien placed this against a sprawling backdrop of epic nature .
sauron has recruited the once wise and good wizard saruman , who was a teacher to gandalf , and has started to create a giant army of uruk-hai , basically a smarter and more ferocious breed of orc .
the army he is preparing in the fellowship is poised to strike against all races of middle-earth .
but the world of men has divided into smaller kingdoms - rohan and gondor - and lacks leadership to take the battle to the forces of evil .
elves and dwarves take no part in the affairs of men and seen unwilling to help .
the bad guys sauron saruman orcs uruk-hai but there is hope .
frodo 's companion aragorn - who is also the paramour of the elf princess arwen - is the true descendant of the lost kings of all men .
in the trilogy he will face his own personal quest to reclaim his birthright .
unhappy ending the fellowship of the ring ends in despair , however .
gandalf appears to fall to his death battling a demon in the mines of moria while boromir becomes obsessed with the ring and believes he could use its power to defend his homelands .
he tries unsuccessfully to snatch the ring from frodo , who then realises he must travel to mordor alone because he can not trust his companions .
as frodo flees , a band of uruk-hai attack the party , killing boromir and kidnapping merry and pippin .
loyal sam pursues frodo and the pair set out once more on the quest together .
aragorn , gimli and legolas realise they can do no more for the pair .
instead , they vow to save merry and pippin and set off in pursuit of the orcs .
the fellowship is broken , but the quest continues .
in the second part of the trilogy the forces of evil attack the world of men , driven on and fuelled by the evil powers of the two towers , the dominion of saruman and his master sauron .

valleys energy ltd is seeking planning approval for a 460-megawatt power station near onllwyn in the dulais valley in south wales .
it is being billed as one of the most environmentally friendly power stations of its kind in the world .
the project is also expected to secure up to 1,000 jobs - as well as the future of tower colliery - and give wales a head-start in the production of ' green ' energy .
a former opencast site at onllwyn , north of neath , has been selected for the project because of the location 's rail links for coal deliveries .
several million tonnes of anthracite would be needed during the power station 's projected 20-year lifespan .
valleys energy said the plant it wants to build - an integrated gas combined cycle power station - would generate electricity more efficiently and more cleanly than a conventional coal-fired power station .
' green ' fuel managing director peter whitton said the project could also help wales win a share of the emerging hydrogen market - the supply of ' green ' fuel for vehicles , as well as power for homes and industry .
he said : " we will use locally-produced coal , but instead of burning it we will turn it into clean gas to generate electricity .
" pollutants will be removed during the process , creating clean hydrogen to drive an advanced gas turbine and generate electricity .
" this is a very environmentally friendly process and is more efficient and much cleaner than a conventional coal-fired power station , with very low emissions and no smoke or plumes from cooling towers .
" the station is being specifically designed so that in the future even the carbon dioxide can be captured for long-term storage . "
but environmental campaigners want to see a reduction of carbon dioxide production as an immediate priority .
welsh assembly government minister for economic development , andrew davies , described the plans , which would create up to 120 jobs as well as securing hundreds more , as " a very interesting proposal " .
he said : " south wales is a net importer of energy and this project could help provide much more locally-produced power .
" it is also an imaginative use of clean coal and hydrogen technology which could have long-term benefits for the local economy . "
neath am gwenda thomas welcomed the proposal which she hopes will bring jobs to her constituency .
' coal technology ' she said : " it is vital that the residents and the community of onllwyn , must be given all the information available about the project , and all the technical processes that will be involved in this scheme . "
tower colliery 's sales and marketing director phil white added : " we welcome this announcement as it will help to bring coal back into focus , with the emphasis on clean coal technology . "
subject to planning approval from neath port talbot council and approval by the uk energy secretary , valleys energy hopes to begin construction in 2004 and begin producing electricity from 2007 .
noel crowley , leader of neath port talbot council , said : " this is something that is desperately needed and welcome provided it provides jobs for local people and it 's going to be green . "
i think this is a golden opportunity provided all the worries can be met by the developers " noel crowley , neath port talbot council " but we will want to be reassured that all promises made are upheld .
" the valleys have n't jobs since the coal mines closed and we need this to provide some security .
" i think this is a golden opportunity provided all the worries can be met by the developers . "
and local resident tom marsden added : " i think it will be tremendous if it lives up to expectations , employs local people and does n't damage the environment . "

a report published on wednesday by the group tidy northern ireland has deemed many roads , play areas and car parks as unsatisfactory and " downright dirty " .
more than half of the province 's 26 councils fell below the standards set in a similar survey last year .
the report said the fall was particularly alarming in belfast , cookstown , magherafelt and limavady .
rats are a by-product of litter tidy northern ireland 's surveyors examined the local authority areas for litter , dog fouling , graffiti and vandalism .
its northern ireland director , ian cole , said he hoped the report would shake councils and their residents into putting more effort into keeping the streets clean .
" perhaps the feeling is that with so many other problems , things like litter do n't matter , " he said .
" yet if people live in a poor quality environment , they feel less safe and behave in a more anti-social way .
" failing to keep our neighbourhoods tidy can result in higher crime rates , decreased business and tourism opportunities and even problems with vermin , " said mr cole .
making the grade trained researchers looked at 2,326 council-owned sites for the survey .
ards borough council came out best with more than a third of its sites being awarded an a grade .
at the other end of the scale , more than 10 % of belfast 's sites were given a d grade while the figure in omagh was 16 % .
sweet wrappers were seen at three quarters of the areas surveyed .
eamonn holmes said belfast 's streets were dirty cigarette ends , boxes and matches were found to be the biggest problem , being found at 86 % of the sites .
mr cole said : " we are throwing open the door to councils to come and work with us so that together we can create the kind of quality local environments we want to live in . "
earlier this year , television presenter eamonn holmes said belfast 's streets were covered with the vomit of drunks and litter .
" it is my city and i 'm not talking as someone who just occasionally passes through it , " he said .
" drink and drugs and the lack of anyone doing anything about the situation is part of the problem .

the biggest disagreements between the two rival presidential candidates hinge on how friendly to be towards communist north korea and , by implication , attitudes to the united states , which includes the north in its " axis of evil " .
differences on economic policy have been less intense .
but economists believe that how bold the new government is about expanding economic reforms could decide if asia 's third biggest economy steps into the ranks of the world 's top ten richest nations within the decade or not .
the next step get it right and korea 's sophisticated hi-tech economy could rival that of france or germany in 10 years , says james rooney , vice-chairman of deloitte consulting in seoul .
mess it up and korea 's window of opportunity could slam shut as its fast-growing neighbour china corners a bigger slice of trade and investment .
" what this next administration does with the next five years is going to determine how successful korea is with its future , " says mr rooney .
the country 's growth prospects remain strong as korea is in the midst of a shift away from an austere emphasis on capital investment and saving towards spending on services .
south korea has transformed itself in just 40 years from a poor agricultural economy to the world 's 13th biggest , and a member of the rich nations ' club , the oecd .
in that time , it has averaged growth of 8 % a year , establishing global brands in key industries , such as hyundai in cars , samsung in mobile phones and lg in electronics .
back from the brink it suffered humiliation during the asian financial crisis , finding itself forced to turn to the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- for a loan .
unemployment rose and glitzy stores were replaced by discount retailers , known as " imf shops " .
but korea took the reform medicine and has emerged stronger .
the government 's growth forecast is 6 % this year , more than double that of most oecd countries .
it has impressed foreign investors by paying back its $ 58bn debt to the imf on time and carrying out reforms more thoroughly than other " asian tiger " economies .
one of the most important reforms was a shake out of the banking system in which the state poured about $ 150bn in public money into the banks to wipe out their bad debts .
greater transparency bank reforms weakened some of the cosy links between the financial sector and korea 's huge conglomerates , or chaebols , forcing them to tackle loss-making businesses and to operate in a more transparent , less cronyist way .
banks switched their lending to consumers instead , helping them to spend their way out of recession with a credit card boom .
foreign investors want these processes to go much further .
the trouble is that both presidential candidates are tied to conservative vested interests who might dampen the pace of change .
pressure for slower change liberal human rights lawyer roh moo-hyun has links to the powerful trade unions .
he has promised better living standards and tougher controls on the chaebols .
his more conservative rival , lee hoi-chang , an ex-supreme court judge , is closer to the chaebols .
he wants to cut corporate taxes and abolish restrictive labour laws .
mr lee 's supporters are " the old firm and reform will definitely ease " if he wins , says aidan foster-carter , a korea specialist at leeds university .
however , mr roh 's anti-american , anti-big business populism could fuel opposition to foreign investment and wider market opening , says dr foster-carter .
union power delayed the sell off of loss-making firms like daewoo motor , for instance .
ultimately , both parties are split between reformers and conservatives , in the view of choi byung-il , general secretary of the citizens united for a better society pressure group .
' now or never ' much depends on how adventurous the winner is prepared to be in juggling these conflicting pressures , economists say .
they also believe korea faces a once-only chance to enter the big league , poised between a major opportunity and a huge threat .
it is " only a matter of time " before korea faces a direct economic challenge from china , where wages are lower , says dr foster-carter .
mr rooney likens korea to a ballerina balancing on a elephant .
if the balancing act fails , south korea 's chances of economic stardom will be crushed by it gargantuan neighbour .
but if south korea can take its economy to the next level of sophistication it , like hong kong , can become a regional financial centre feeding the elephant and itself at the same time , he believes .
the opportunity consists in " filling in the blanks " in korea 's service sector to offer better lifestyles for the country 's 48 million consumers , says mr rooney .
from the leisure industry or financial products such as credit cards and mortgages , what is on offer remains less developed than in europe or the us .
" if korea pursues the ambitious opportunities that face it - to globalise korea , to bring it out into the world , to seek to become a regional business centre , to internationalise its financial markets - it could become number seven or number eight " among world economies , says mr rooney .
if not , " the window of opportunity will go away because of the sheer size of the china factor " .

the biggest disagreements between the two rival presidential candidates hinge on how friendly to be towards communist north korea and , by implication , attitudes to the united states , which includes the north in its " axis of evil " .
click here for the latest news on the election differences on economic policy have been less intense .
but economists believe that how bold the new government is about expanding economic reforms could decide if asia 's third biggest economy steps into the ranks of the world 's top ten richest nations within the decade or not .
the next step get it right and korea 's sophisticated hi-tech economy could rival that of france or germany in 10 years , says james rooney , vice-chairman of deloitte consulting in seoul .
mess it up and korea 's window of opportunity could slam shut as its fast-growing neighbour china corners a bigger slice of trade and investment .
korea 's economy is doing well " what this next administration does with the next five years is going to determine how successful korea is with its future , " says mr rooney .
the country 's growth prospects remain strong as korea is in the midst of a shift away from an austere emphasis on capital investment and saving towards spending on services .
south korea has transformed itself in just 40 years from a poor agricultural economy to the world 's 13th biggest , and a member of the rich nations ' club , the oecd .
in that time , it has averaged growth of 8 % a year , establishing global brands in key industries , such as hyundai in cars , samsung in mobile phones and lg in electronics .
back from the brink it suffered humiliation during the asian financial crisis , finding itself forced to turn to the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- for a loan .
unemployment rose and glitzy stores were replaced by discount retailers , known as " imf shops " .
anti-us protests worry foreign investors but korea took the reform medicine and has emerged stronger .
the government 's growth forecast is 6 % this year , more than double that of most oecd countries .
it has impressed foreign investors by paying back its $ 58bn debt to the imf on time and carrying out reforms more thoroughly than other " asian tiger " economies .
one of the most important reforms was a shake out of the banking system in which the state poured about $ 150bn in public money into the banks to wipe out their bad debts .
greater transparency bank reforms weakened some of the cosy links between the financial sector and korea 's huge conglomerates , or chaebols , forcing them to tackle loss-making businesses and to operate in a more transparent , less cronyist way .
banks switched their lending to consumers instead , helping them to spend their way out of recession with a credit card boom .
foreign investors want these processes to go much further .
the trouble is that both presidential candidates are tied to conservative vested interests who might dampen the pace of change .
pressure for slower change liberal human rights lawyer roh moo-hyun has links to the powerful trade unions .
he has promised better living standards and tougher controls on the chaebols .
big strikes are frequent his more conservative rival , lee hoi-chang , an ex-supreme court judge , is closer to the chaebols .
he wants to cut corporate taxes and abolish restrictive labour laws .
mr lee 's supporters are " the old firm and reform will definitely ease " if he wins , says aidan foster-carter , a korea specialist at leeds university .
however , mr roh 's anti-american , anti-big business populism could fuel opposition to foreign investment and wider market opening , says dr foster-carter .
union power delayed the sell off of loss-making firms like daewoo motor , for instance .
ultimately , both parties are split between reformers and conservatives , in the view of choi byung-il , general secretary of the citizens united for a better society pressure group .
' now or never ' much depends on how adventurous the winner is prepared to be in juggling these conflicting pressures , economists say .
they also believe korea faces a once-only chance to enter the big league , poised between a major opportunity and a huge threat .
it is " only a matter of time " before korea faces a direct economic challenge from china , where wages are lower , says dr foster-carter .
mr rooney likens korea to a ballerina balancing on a elephant .
bank and credit card loans have risen 34 % in a year if the balancing act fails , south korea 's chances of economic stardom will be crushed by it gargantuan neighbour .
but if south korea can take its economy to the next level of sophistication it , like hong kong , can become a regional financial centre feeding the elephant and itself at the same time , he believes .
the opportunity consists in " filling in the blanks " in korea 's service sector to offer better lifestyles for the country 's 48 million consumers , says mr rooney .
from the leisure industry or financial products such as credit cards and mortgages , what is on offer remains less developed than in europe or the us .
" if korea pursues the ambitious opportunities that face it - to globalise korea , to bring it out into the world , to seek to become a regional business centre , to internationalise its financial markets - it could become number seven or number eight " among world economies , says mr rooney .
if not , " the window of opportunity will go away because of the sheer size of the china factor " .

the mood was bleak and many were depressed by argentina 's humiliating slide into penury .
over the year the country 's economy has shrunk by more than 10 % , while its currency has lost nearly three quarters of its value .
circumstances have been rough , but people adjust themselves esteban popper argentina 's people are still suffering , but to some extent the storm has subsided .
" the truckload falls into place during the trip , " says esteban popper , a retired business man , quoting an old argentine saying .
" circumstances have been rough , but people adjust themselves . "
last week , we re-visited our argentines to discover how life has changed during 2002 .
click below for the individual stories : the retired couple with little hope the office worker who lost his money the interpreter who fled abroad the website designer home alone the retired couple with little hope esteban and ellen popper are a retired couple living in buenos aires .
since we last spoke , mrs popper 's son and family have emigrated to israel .
last february the prospect of her son 's departure had made her sad .
now it 's a reality .
millions are unemployed " the argentines were born depressed , " says her husband , mr popper .
" this country has been marked by melancholy .
just listen to the tango . "
the poppers belong to argentina 's once prosperous middle classes .
earlier this year , many of their compatriots took the streets to bang pots , embittered by new regulations that barred them from withdrawing their savings from the country 's banks .
" the middle classes do n't go out to dine anymore or to the cinema , " says mrs popper .
together the couple collect a pension of 310 pesos -lrb- £ 55 ; $ 88 -rrb- a month and have been forced to supplement it by mortgaging their farm in the country .
" there was not enough to buy my husband 's medicine , so we had to mortgage the farm . "
' ghosts in the night ' earlier in the year , mrs popper was concerned about the " marginalised " people with no jobs .
months later , many of them now sort through rubbish for a living .
argentina 's paper industry has experienced a revival following hikes in the cost of paper imports .
the demand for pulp has spawned a cottage industry .
one year ago there is big , big depression here ellen popper read how shopping became an art form for the poppers " all you see around town are people going from refuse bag to refuse bag taking out any little bits of paper , " she says .
" they are like ghosts in the night - it is very sad to see . "
she is disillusioned by the country 's politicians , and does not believe there will be an economic recovery while the peronists remain in power .
by contrast , mr popper gives president eduardo duhalde and the economy minister roberto lavagna " 8 + " for their management of the economy .
however , he does not hold out any hope for the country 's upcoming elections .
" plus ça change , " he says .
" but that is probably a symptom of argentine melancholy . "
listen to ellen popper talk about daily life click here to return to the top the office worker who lost his money federico o 'conor works for a pharmaceutical company and is studying for marketing exams in his spare time .
" since the beginning of the year , the mood has changed , " he says .
one year ago everyone is feeling that they have to lose something federico o 'conor read why federico thought anarchy would break out " we 're having a little summer .
there has been small growth in the economy and the exchange rate with the dollar has n't changed much . "
when the government devalued the peso last january , federico 's dollar savings in the bank lost much of their value .
the savings were turned into pesos , and he was not allowed to access them , as the government introduced draconian measures to forestall a run on the banks .
since then he has been able to withdraw his money " little-by-little " and changed it back into dollars .
the economic crisis also forced him to cancel any plans to travel abroad .
the punitive cost of foreign travel has seen many argentines flock to domestic resorts .
" i know my country more than i used to , " he says wryly .
anarchy ?
but he is philosophical .
" i do n't think my case is a very good example of someone who has suffered .
i still have my job .
" not being able to travel is a nice problem compared to other problems in argentina .
" many people are poor and children in the provinces are starving . "
in the misiones province this year , 13 children have died from malnutrition he is also frustrated by the government 's protracted negotiations with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- to borrow money .
" they should break with the imf or accept what they impose .
they should n't waste time while people are starving . "
his fear in february of imminent anarchy has dulled .
however , he is still wary in case carlos menem is chosen by his party to stand as the peronist candidate in the general elections .
" if he wins -lsb- the party elections -rsb- there could be anarchy .
the masses will vote for him because he is seen as the champion of the poor .
" but the middle classes do n't like him and there will be many protests for and against him . "
click here to return to the top the interpreter who fled abroad carmen is a 49-year-old uruguayan , who spent 19 years in argentina .
in february , she left to work abroad as a freelance interpreter .
" it is not all wine and roses , " carmen says of her decision to emigrate to belgium .
" i moved from a 170 square metre apartment in a posh section of buenos aires to a 60 metre flat in a so-so neighbourhood .
" i had somebody to do all the housework and now i do not , but above all i had many friends and here i have made too few . "
carmen works mainly for the european union in brussels , but says her work is less riveting than it was in argentina where she was a freelance interpreter for the government .
" i was a general and now i 'm a foot soldier , but the money is good . "
she is also grateful for the chance to start again after the uncertainty of her previous life .
a country of contradictions in august carmen returned to argentina for a brief visit .
" i was shocked by the number of people roaming the streets in search for anything they can sell from the garbage cans . "
one year ago so much going down the drain , not just for us , but for everybody we know carmen read why carmen left argentina but at the same time , she was struck by contradictions .
" flights to ski resorts were full last winter , and most long weekends have seen brisk business at tourist destinations .
" compared to only a year ago , prices are dirt cheap if you have dollars at hand . "
" and in trendy areas , restaurants are still full .
a friend of mine , who is a trained psychiatrist , believes middle class people need to spend the little money they can save to help retain their dignity . "
despite her decision to find a new life overseas , carmen is optimistic that the argentine economy will recover .
" i still believe argentina is no ethiopia .
it has minerals , oil , agricultural products and wine .
" it should be able to pick up the pieces .
but i do n't know when - maybe in five or 10 years . "

fernando resigned from his full-time job at a computer gaming magazine in january .
he lost confidence in the management and decided to go it alone , working from home .
fernando would always come back to argentina " it has been difficult as there are not many jobs around and people do n't want to pay in dollars anymore , " he says .
however , fernando is hopeful that the situation will improve .
" the economy has to get better - it is so bad it could n't get any worse . "
he is also critical of the international monetary fund , which has so far resisted lending more money to argentina .
" they helped uruguay but not argentina .
i can understand in some ways because of what happened here and because the politicians are corrupt .
" but i do n't think you can let people die because of that .
there are people starving here . "
less justice , more trust ?
fernando says one of the worst things about argentina 's crisis is the lack of justice .
" our rights have been taken away - we could n't even take out our own money -lsb- from the banks -rsb- . "
nevertheless , he has been reassured by the recent and partial lifting of banking controls , which has allowed people to access some of their savings again .
" people did n't rush to take their money out - i think people are starting to trust in the banks more .
" they are also not rushing to buy dollars like they did a year ago . "
fernando 's fiancée from new york has decided to move to argentina despite the problems .
" she thinks it is a better place to live , " he says .
" and i 'm not tempted to move to new york .
i might go to the us or europe for a short period , but i would always want to come back to argentina . "
