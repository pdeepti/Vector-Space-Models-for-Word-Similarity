jayne nixon , 26 , left england on 1 april for a round-the-world trip in an attempt to get over the break-up of a long-term relationship .
a thai police spokesman said there had been no sign of a struggle , but officers wanted to question a man who checked into the hotel with her on friday .
their investigation continues , with the results of a post-mortem examination and forensic tests not due to be released until later this week .
" bubbly person " miss nixon 's body was discovered in the rama hotel in thailand 's capital city on saturday morning .
the officer leading the investigation said he dealt with the deaths of two to three westerners a month in the banglampu district of the city , and most of the deaths turned out to be as a result of natural causes .
miss nixon 's former boyfriend of six years , nick hayes , from tring in hertfordshire , said : " jayne was a really friendly , bubbly person and did not have an enemy in the world .
" i am devastated .
she had wanted to see the world and used the money from the sale of our house to go . "
the pair sold their cottage in the town last year when they split up .
jayne , who had been working for a firm of solicitors as a legal secretary , left the country two weeks ago to fulfill her ambition to travel .
her father , william , said : " she was no fool and knew the risks involved in travelling .
i can not understand what has happened .
we 're all devastated . "
" deeply upset " he is being comforted at the family home in kencot , oxfordshire , by his wife , sandra , and children chris , 28 , and sara , 30 .
the family is expected to go to thailand after talks with foreign office representatives .
mr nixon said : " she was heading to perth in australia and then hopefully to new zealand .
we were n't expecting her back for several months .
" i think she was just stopping in thailand for a few weeks to see the country .
we 're all obviously deeply upset at the moment . "
lieutenant suchart pirom , who is in charge of the case , said : " police are still investigating the cause of the british woman 's death .
it may take a week to determine the cause . "
male companion he said the room where miss nixon was found at the nakhonping hotel , located in a popular backpacker quarter of bangkok , was in a normal state .
miss nixon arrived in thailand on tuesday and checked in to the hotel with her male companion on friday , and police now want to speak to him " as a matter of urgency " .
another british backpacker was found dead in thailand two years ago .
liverpool university graduate kirsty jones , 23 , was found raped and murdered in a guesthouse in chang mai , 500 miles north of bangkok .
no-one has ever stood trial for her murder and the dead woman 's parents criticised the thai police over their handling of the investigation into her death .
last january royal thai police announced a new unit would take over from local officers on that case following a review of the investigation by detectives from wales . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jonathan head " police are treating the death as suspicious " top asia-pacific stories now : blaze kills 42 in indonesian bar china vows to overhaul courts koreas trade fresh war of words philippines church apologises for sex abuse search for ' spy ' pilots in china chinese chemical spill kills 13 malaysian state passes islamic law vietnam 's unburied soldiers head home links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .

" insolvency does not mean the destruction or the end of the company , rather an opportunity and it also means new owners , " said edmund stoiber , the bavarian premier and conservative challenger to chancellor gerhard schroeder .
" i expect , and i have clear indications , that it will be possible to continue to run the group as an integrated media concern , " he said in a television interview on sunday .
the kirch empire , which owns the television rights to formula one racing and football 's world cup , is weighed down by a 9bn euros -lrb- $ 7.9bn ; £ 5.5bn -rrb- debt mountain .
the debt burden and a severe cash crunch has brought the group to its knees .
mr stoiber also said that most of the group 's 9,500 jobs could be preserved .
potential plan the comments came on the back of fresh negotiations to throw the media empire a lifeline .
negotiations include kirch 's main banks , its financial advisers and the bavarian government , according to local press reports .
mr stoiber 's state government is especially keen to avoid a full-scale meltdown .
leo kirch is a close friend of mr stoiber , and under his csu party 's instruction the state bayerische landesbank has lent kirch nearly 2bn marks .
the potential rescue package , which would be announced after kirch goes into administration , would let the empire 's cornerstone , kirchmedia , declare itself unable to pay its bills .
subsequently , in a bid to avoid kirch gruppe being broken up , fresh investors would be brought in to push through a restructuring program .
football rights as part of the restructuring , the banks would propose that the group 's world cup rights are transferred into a new company , along with its profitable tv channels and its film library , according to sueddeutsche zeitung .
that report coincided with the weekly der spiegel 's assertion that kirch and football 's governing body fifa have agreed to transfer the world cup tv rights from kirchmedia to one of the group 's swiss subsidiaries .
such a step would move the valuable rights out of reach from kirchmedia 's creditors .

it could also cause the collapse of several of germany 's top football clubs .
germany 's top league , the bundesliga , is fuelled by money from the kirch group , and there has been talk of government loan guarantees to keep the clubs going .

up to a quarter of 13 and 14-year-olds claimed to have " downed " at least five alcoholic drinks in a single session .
the figure rose to half of all 15 and 16-year-olds .
the survey of 14,000 secondary school children across england , scotland and wales was carried out by communities that care for the joseph rowntree foundation .
this is the latest in a series of studies indicating that young people are drinking worrying amounts of alcohol alcohol concern spokesman its authors say such widespread misuse of alcohol amongst under-age drinkers " can not safely be ignored by parents or policy makers " .
they add that drinking amongst young teenagers is linked to anti-social behaviour and use of other drugs .
among 15 to 16-year-olds , 27 % reported three or more binges in the past month .
the survey also found 9 % of boys and 5 % of 11 and 12-year-old girls described themselves as regular drinkers , rising to 39 % of boys and 33 % of girls aged 15 to 16 .
the majority of children said their parents would think it was wrong for them to steal or use illegal drugs .
but the proportion who said their parents would object to under-age drinking declined from 91 % of 11 to 12-year-olds to 56 % of 15 to 16-year-olds .
law breaking david utting of the joseph rowntree foundation said the most worrying findings were 10 % of schoolchildren saying they committed burglary and a quarter of 15 to 16-year-old boys admitting carrying a weapon .
he added : " the national picture is one of concern with violence and the amount of alcohol being drunk by children 13 , 14 and 15 .
" this is not a hand-wringing exercise , though . "
mr utting said the main purpose of the survey was to help local communities compile their own local picture to target action where necessary .
head teachers urge caution .
they say a combination of imagination and bravado makes the results of such surveys of young people notoriously unreliable .
the survey found smoking cigarettes was not as much of a problem , with most 11 to 13-year olds and almost half 15 to 16-year-olds saying they had never smoked a cigarette .
cannabis is the most popular illegal drug but in each age group , more girls than boys said they smoked .
cannabis was the illegal drug most young people had tried , with around 25 % of girls and 30 % of boys aged 15 to 16 having used it at least once .
use of other illegal drugs was relatively low , but rose with age .
frequent abuse of glue or other solvent abuse was rare , but just under 10 % of 13 and 14-year-olds said they had used them at least once .
almost half of those surveyed said they had broken the law .
one in 10 said they had shoplifted on three or more occasions in the previous year .
almost four out of 10 agreed it was " all right to beat people up if they start the fight " .
barry anderson , chief executive of communities that care who co-wrote the report , said : " there is evidence from our survey that particularly early drinking , and heavy drinking , is quite clearly associated with involvement in crime and anti-social behaviour .
' cinderella issue ' " what we could see is that the ones who told us they were constantly drinking were also the ones self-reporting high levels of involvement in youth crime and use of other drugs . "
gp dr sanjoy ray told the bbc : " when they get older , they 'll drink more and more. and they will have many medical problems along with other problems , like social problems . "
a spokesman for the charity alcohol concern said : " this is the latest in a series of studies indicating that young people are drinking worrying amounts of alcohol .
" yet there are still no official targets for reducing young people 's alcohol consumption - as there are for drugs and smoking .
he called for urgent government action to spearhead a " joined-up approach " by all agencies providing support for young people addressing drinking and other factors contributing to their lifestyles , like family breakdowns .
he also called for a national alcohol strategy to look at education , prevention and support .
" without such a proactive approach , alcohol misuse will remain a cinderella issue when compared with drugs or smoking .
