walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany sticks his neck out on thursday night friedman , appearing on television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face in germany .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .
seventy-seven percent were unaware what was discussed at the wannsee conference , where the so-called ' final solution ' to exterminate jews was mapped out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accusations of anti-semitism overshadow middle east visit would-be german foreign minister guido westerwelle has begun a visit to israel at the most inconvenient time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 german anti-semitism debate becomes a war of words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author martin walser key german literary figures say martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' , is based on hatred , adding a new dimension to the national debate about anti-semitism . the furore surrounding german author martin walser 's novel ' death of a critic ' has deepened , with several key german literary figures joining the work 's numerous critics .
walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany sticks his neck out on thursday night friedman , appearing on television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face in germany .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .
seventy-seven percent were unaware what was discussed at the wannsee conference , where the so-called ' final solution ' to exterminate jews was mapped out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accusations of anti-semitism overshadow middle east visit would-be german foreign minister guido westerwelle has begun a visit to israel at the most inconvenient time .

walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany sticks his neck out on thursday night friedman , appearing on television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face in germany .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .
seventy-seven percent were unaware what was discussed at the wannsee conference , where the so-called ' final solution ' to exterminate jews was mapped out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accusations of anti-semitism overshadow middle east visit would-be german foreign minister guido westerwelle has begun a visit to israel at the most inconvenient time .

but a war of words is continuing between german jewish leaders and möllemann 's fdp . the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called a special sitting on friday in an effort to end the debate over controversial remarks by the deputy leader , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
his comments raised the stakes in a national debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , which was sparked by a similar accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon , whose military assault on palestinians he likened to the practices of the nazis .
on thursday night friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , appearing on german television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face .
" until recently , the voices of the extreme right wing were on the fringes of society , " friedman said .
" now they 're freely available from a petrol pump called the fdp .
möllemann is operating it , and westerwelle -lrb- fdp leader -rrb- , is the owner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany debate spreads germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- joined the fray on thursday urging the fdp to distance itself categorically from anti-semitism and rightwing extremism .
spd politicians said they would not work with the fdp in future unless it set itself apart from anti-jewish elements .
as the war of words continues to rage , the fdp says its popularity has not been affected by the controversy .
recent poll ratings of around twelve percent give the party a good chance of entering government later this year .
but the german chancellor gerhard schröder has described the anti-semitism debate as ' disastrous ' and has warned that it could harm germany 's international reputation .
" i do n't believe the fdp is an anti-semitic party , and i do n't actually think möllemann is an anti-semite " , the chancellor said .
but , he added , it would be dangerous if germany gave the impression that those of the jewish faith were not welcome .
the anti-semitism debate has raised questions over germany 's reputation as a country in which world war two guilt has mandated unwavering public support for israel and sensitivity towards the jewish community .
it comes amid growing concern about the rise of the extreme right after electoral gains by the french national front leader jean-marie le pen and the party of murdered dutch rightist pim fortuyn , as well as the anti-immigration national front in local elections in the united kingdom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 germany 's anti-semitism debate continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy leader of the fdp : jürgen w. möllemann pressure mounts on top german liberal jürgen möllemann to apologize for remarks he made about a leading figure in the jewish community .
but a war of words is continuing between german jewish leaders and möllemann 's fdp . the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called a special sitting on friday in an effort to end the debate over controversial remarks by the deputy leader , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
his comments raised the stakes in a national debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , which was sparked by a similar accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon , whose military assault on palestinians he likened to the practices of the nazis .
on thursday night friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , appearing on german television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face .
" until recently , the voices of the extreme right wing were on the fringes of society , " friedman said .
" now they 're freely available from a petrol pump called the fdp .
möllemann is operating it , and westerwelle -lrb- fdp leader -rrb- , is the owner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany debate spreads germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- joined the fray on thursday urging the fdp to distance itself categorically from anti-semitism and rightwing extremism .
spd politicians said they would not work with the fdp in future unless it set itself apart from anti-jewish elements .
as the war of words continues to rage , the fdp says its popularity has not been affected by the controversy .
recent poll ratings of around twelve percent give the party a good chance of entering government later this year .
but the german chancellor gerhard schröder has described the anti-semitism debate as ' disastrous ' and has warned that it could harm germany 's international reputation .
" i do n't believe the fdp is an anti-semitic party , and i do n't actually think möllemann is an anti-semite " , the chancellor said .
but , he added , it would be dangerous if germany gave the impression that those of the jewish faith were not welcome .
the anti-semitism debate has raised questions over germany 's reputation as a country in which world war two guilt has mandated unwavering public support for israel and sensitivity towards the jewish community .
it comes amid growing concern about the rise of the extreme right after electoral gains by the french national front leader jean-marie le pen and the party of murdered dutch rightist pim fortuyn , as well as the anti-immigration national front in local elections in the united kingdom .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was also the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 german anti-semitism debate becomes a war of words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author martin walser key german literary figures say martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' , is based on hatred , adding a new dimension to the national debate about anti-semitism . the furore surrounding german author martin walser 's novel ' death of a critic ' has deepened , with several key german literary figures joining the work 's numerous critics .
walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany sticks his neck out on thursday night friedman , appearing on television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face in germany .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 german anti-semitism debate becomes a war of words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author martin walser key german literary figures say martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' , is based on hatred , adding a new dimension to the national debate about anti-semitism . the furore surrounding german author martin walser 's novel ' death of a critic ' has deepened , with several key german literary figures joining the work 's numerous critics .
walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany sticks his neck out on thursday night friedman , appearing on television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face in germany .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .

but a war of words is continuing between german jewish leaders and möllemann 's fdp . the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called a special sitting on friday in an effort to end the debate over controversial remarks by the deputy leader , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
his comments raised the stakes in a national debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , which was sparked by a similar accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon , whose military assault on palestinians he likened to the practices of the nazis .
on thursday night friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , appearing on german television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face .
" until recently , the voices of the extreme right wing were on the fringes of society , " friedman said .
" now they 're freely available from a petrol pump called the fdp .
möllemann is operating it , and westerwelle -lrb- fdp leader -rrb- , is the owner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany debate spreads germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- joined the fray on thursday urging the fdp to distance itself categorically from anti-semitism and rightwing extremism .
spd politicians said they would not work with the fdp in future unless it set itself apart from anti-jewish elements .
as the war of words continues to rage , the fdp says its popularity has not been affected by the controversy .
recent poll ratings of around twelve percent give the party a good chance of entering government later this year .
but the german chancellor gerhard schröder has described the anti-semitism debate as ' disastrous ' and has warned that it could harm germany 's international reputation .
" i do n't believe the fdp is an anti-semitic party , and i do n't actually think möllemann is an anti-semite " , the chancellor said .
but , he added , it would be dangerous if germany gave the impression that those of the jewish faith were not welcome .
the anti-semitism debate has raised questions over germany 's reputation as a country in which world war two guilt has mandated unwavering public support for israel and sensitivity towards the jewish community .
it comes amid growing concern about the rise of the extreme right after electoral gains by the french national front leader jean-marie le pen and the party of murdered dutch rightist pim fortuyn , as well as the anti-immigration national front in local elections in the united kingdom .

walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany sticks his neck out on thursday night friedman , appearing on television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face in germany .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .

his comments raised the stakes in a national debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , which was sparked by a similar accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon , whose military assault on palestinians he likened to the practices of the nazis .
on thursday night friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , appearing on german television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face .
" until recently , the voices of the extreme right wing were on the fringes of society , " friedman said .
" now they 're freely available from a petrol pump called the fdp .
möllemann is operating it , and westerwelle -lrb- fdp leader -rrb- , is the owner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany debate spreads germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- joined the fray on thursday urging the fdp to distance itself categorically from anti-semitism and rightwing extremism .
spd politicians said they would not work with the fdp in future unless it set itself apart from anti-jewish elements .
as the war of words continues to rage , the fdp says its popularity has not been affected by the controversy .
recent poll ratings of around twelve percent give the party a good chance of entering government later this year .
but the german chancellor gerhard schröder has described the anti-semitism debate as ' disastrous ' and has warned that it could harm germany 's international reputation .
" i do n't believe the fdp is an anti-semitic party , and i do n't actually think möllemann is an anti-semite " , the chancellor said .
but , he added , it would be dangerous if germany gave the impression that those of the jewish faith were not welcome .
the anti-semitism debate has raised questions over germany 's reputation as a country in which world war two guilt has mandated unwavering public support for israel and sensitivity towards the jewish community .
it comes amid growing concern about the rise of the extreme right after electoral gains by the french national front leader jean-marie le pen and the party of murdered dutch rightist pim fortuyn , as well as the anti-immigration national front in local elections in the united kingdom .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was also the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .
seventy-seven percent were unaware what was discussed at the wannsee conference , where the so-called ' final solution ' to exterminate jews was mapped out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accusations of anti-semitism overshadow middle east visit would-be german foreign minister guido westerwelle has begun a visit to israel at the most inconvenient time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 germany 's anti-semitism debate continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy leader of the fdp : jürgen w. möllemann pressure mounts on top german liberal jürgen möllemann to apologize for remarks he made about a leading figure in the jewish community .
but a war of words is continuing between german jewish leaders and möllemann 's fdp . the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called a special sitting on friday in an effort to end the debate over controversial remarks by the deputy leader , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
his comments raised the stakes in a national debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , which was sparked by a similar accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon , whose military assault on palestinians he likened to the practices of the nazis .
on thursday night friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , appearing on german television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face .
" until recently , the voices of the extreme right wing were on the fringes of society , " friedman said .
" now they 're freely available from a petrol pump called the fdp .
möllemann is operating it , and westerwelle -lrb- fdp leader -rrb- , is the owner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany debate spreads germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- joined the fray on thursday urging the fdp to distance itself categorically from anti-semitism and rightwing extremism .
spd politicians said they would not work with the fdp in future unless it set itself apart from anti-jewish elements .
as the war of words continues to rage , the fdp says its popularity has not been affected by the controversy .
recent poll ratings of around twelve percent give the party a good chance of entering government later this year .
but the german chancellor gerhard schröder has described the anti-semitism debate as ' disastrous ' and has warned that it could harm germany 's international reputation .
" i do n't believe the fdp is an anti-semitic party , and i do n't actually think möllemann is an anti-semite " , the chancellor said .
but , he added , it would be dangerous if germany gave the impression that those of the jewish faith were not welcome .
the anti-semitism debate has raised questions over germany 's reputation as a country in which world war two guilt has mandated unwavering public support for israel and sensitivity towards the jewish community .
it comes amid growing concern about the rise of the extreme right after electoral gains by the french national front leader jean-marie le pen and the party of murdered dutch rightist pim fortuyn , as well as the anti-immigration national front in local elections in the united kingdom .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was also the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .
seventy-seven percent were unaware what was discussed at the wannsee conference , where the so-called ' final solution ' to exterminate jews was mapped out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accusations of anti-semitism overshadow middle east visit would-be german foreign minister guido westerwelle has begun a visit to israel at the most inconvenient time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 german anti-semitism debate becomes a war of words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author martin walser key german literary figures say martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' , is based on hatred , adding a new dimension to the national debate about anti-semitism . the furore surrounding german author martin walser 's novel ' death of a critic ' has deepened , with several key german literary figures joining the work 's numerous critics .
walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany sticks his neck out on thursday night friedman , appearing on television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face in germany .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .

walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany sticks his neck out on thursday night friedman , appearing on television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face in germany .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .
seventy-seven percent were unaware what was discussed at the wannsee conference , where the so-called ' final solution ' to exterminate jews was mapped out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accusations of anti-semitism overshadow middle east visit would-be german foreign minister guido westerwelle has begun a visit to israel at the most inconvenient time .

but a war of words is continuing between german jewish leaders and möllemann 's fdp . the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called a special sitting on friday in an effort to end the debate over controversial remarks by the deputy leader , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
his comments raised the stakes in a national debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , which was sparked by a similar accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon , whose military assault on palestinians he likened to the practices of the nazis .
on thursday night friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , appearing on german television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face .
" until recently , the voices of the extreme right wing were on the fringes of society , " friedman said .
" now they 're freely available from a petrol pump called the fdp .
möllemann is operating it , and westerwelle -lrb- fdp leader -rrb- , is the owner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany debate spreads germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- joined the fray on thursday urging the fdp to distance itself categorically from anti-semitism and rightwing extremism .
spd politicians said they would not work with the fdp in future unless it set itself apart from anti-jewish elements .
as the war of words continues to rage , the fdp says its popularity has not been affected by the controversy .
recent poll ratings of around twelve percent give the party a good chance of entering government later this year .
but the german chancellor gerhard schröder has described the anti-semitism debate as ' disastrous ' and has warned that it could harm germany 's international reputation .
" i do n't believe the fdp is an anti-semitic party , and i do n't actually think möllemann is an anti-semite " , the chancellor said .
but , he added , it would be dangerous if germany gave the impression that those of the jewish faith were not welcome .
the anti-semitism debate has raised questions over germany 's reputation as a country in which world war two guilt has mandated unwavering public support for israel and sensitivity towards the jewish community .
it comes amid growing concern about the rise of the extreme right after electoral gains by the french national front leader jean-marie le pen and the party of murdered dutch rightist pim fortuyn , as well as the anti-immigration national front in local elections in the united kingdom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 germany 's anti-semitism debate continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy leader of the fdp : jürgen w. möllemann pressure mounts on top german liberal jürgen möllemann to apologize for remarks he made about a leading figure in the jewish community .
but a war of words is continuing between german jewish leaders and möllemann 's fdp . the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called a special sitting on friday in an effort to end the debate over controversial remarks by the deputy leader , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
his comments raised the stakes in a national debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , which was sparked by a similar accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon , whose military assault on palestinians he likened to the practices of the nazis .
on thursday night friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , appearing on german television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face .
" until recently , the voices of the extreme right wing were on the fringes of society , " friedman said .
" now they 're freely available from a petrol pump called the fdp .
möllemann is operating it , and westerwelle -lrb- fdp leader -rrb- , is the owner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany debate spreads germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- joined the fray on thursday urging the fdp to distance itself categorically from anti-semitism and rightwing extremism .
spd politicians said they would not work with the fdp in future unless it set itself apart from anti-jewish elements .
as the war of words continues to rage , the fdp says its popularity has not been affected by the controversy .
recent poll ratings of around twelve percent give the party a good chance of entering government later this year .
but the german chancellor gerhard schröder has described the anti-semitism debate as ' disastrous ' and has warned that it could harm germany 's international reputation .
" i do n't believe the fdp is an anti-semitic party , and i do n't actually think möllemann is an anti-semite " , the chancellor said .
but , he added , it would be dangerous if germany gave the impression that those of the jewish faith were not welcome .
the anti-semitism debate has raised questions over germany 's reputation as a country in which world war two guilt has mandated unwavering public support for israel and sensitivity towards the jewish community .
it comes amid growing concern about the rise of the extreme right after electoral gains by the french national front leader jean-marie le pen and the party of murdered dutch rightist pim fortuyn , as well as the anti-immigration national front in local elections in the united kingdom .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was also the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .
seventy-seven percent were unaware what was discussed at the wannsee conference , where the so-called ' final solution ' to exterminate jews was mapped out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accusations of anti-semitism overshadow middle east visit would-be german foreign minister guido westerwelle has begun a visit to israel at the most inconvenient time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 german anti-semitism debate becomes a war of words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author martin walser key german literary figures say martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' , is based on hatred , adding a new dimension to the national debate about anti-semitism . the furore surrounding german author martin walser 's novel ' death of a critic ' has deepened , with several key german literary figures joining the work 's numerous critics .
walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany sticks his neck out on thursday night friedman , appearing on television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face in germany .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .

publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .

ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 german anti-semitism debate becomes a war of words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author martin walser key german literary figures say martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' , is based on hatred , adding a new dimension to the national debate about anti-semitism . the furore surrounding german author martin walser 's novel ' death of a critic ' has deepened , with several key german literary figures joining the work 's numerous critics .
walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .

ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 germany 's anti-semitism debate continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy leader of the fdp : jürgen w. möllemann pressure mounts on top german liberal jürgen möllemann to apologize for remarks he made about a leading figure in the jewish community .
but a war of words is continuing between german jewish leaders and möllemann 's fdp . the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called a special sitting on friday in an effort to end the debate over controversial remarks by the deputy leader , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
his comments raised the stakes in a national debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , which was sparked by a similar accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon , whose military assault on palestinians he likened to the practices of the nazis .
on thursday night friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , appearing on german television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face .
" until recently , the voices of the extreme right wing were on the fringes of society , " friedman said .
" now they 're freely available from a petrol pump called the fdp .
möllemann is operating it , and westerwelle -lrb- fdp leader -rrb- , is the owner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany debate spreads germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- joined the fray on thursday urging the fdp to distance itself categorically from anti-semitism and rightwing extremism .
spd politicians said they would not work with the fdp in future unless it set itself apart from anti-jewish elements .
as the war of words continues to rage , the fdp says its popularity has not been affected by the controversy .
recent poll ratings of around twelve percent give the party a good chance of entering government later this year .
but the german chancellor gerhard schröder has described the anti-semitism debate as ' disastrous ' and has warned that it could harm germany 's international reputation .
" i do n't believe the fdp is an anti-semitic party , and i do n't actually think möllemann is an anti-semite " , the chancellor said .
but , he added , it would be dangerous if germany gave the impression that those of the jewish faith were not welcome .
the anti-semitism debate has raised questions over germany 's reputation as a country in which world war two guilt has mandated unwavering public support for israel and sensitivity towards the jewish community .
it comes amid growing concern about the rise of the extreme right after electoral gains by the french national front leader jean-marie le pen and the party of murdered dutch rightist pim fortuyn , as well as the anti-immigration national front in local elections in the united kingdom .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was also the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 germany 's anti-semitism debate continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy leader of the fdp : jürgen w. möllemann pressure mounts on top german liberal jürgen möllemann to apologize for remarks he made about a leading figure in the jewish community .
but a war of words is continuing between german jewish leaders and möllemann 's fdp . the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called a special sitting on friday in an effort to end the debate over controversial remarks by the deputy leader , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
his comments raised the stakes in a national debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , which was sparked by a similar accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon , whose military assault on palestinians he likened to the practices of the nazis .
on thursday night friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , appearing on german television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face .
" until recently , the voices of the extreme right wing were on the fringes of society , " friedman said .
" now they 're freely available from a petrol pump called the fdp .
möllemann is operating it , and westerwelle -lrb- fdp leader -rrb- , is the owner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany debate spreads germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- joined the fray on thursday urging the fdp to distance itself categorically from anti-semitism and rightwing extremism .
spd politicians said they would not work with the fdp in future unless it set itself apart from anti-jewish elements .
as the war of words continues to rage , the fdp says its popularity has not been affected by the controversy .
recent poll ratings of around twelve percent give the party a good chance of entering government later this year .
but the german chancellor gerhard schröder has described the anti-semitism debate as ' disastrous ' and has warned that it could harm germany 's international reputation .
" i do n't believe the fdp is an anti-semitic party , and i do n't actually think möllemann is an anti-semite " , the chancellor said .
but , he added , it would be dangerous if germany gave the impression that those of the jewish faith were not welcome .
the anti-semitism debate has raised questions over germany 's reputation as a country in which world war two guilt has mandated unwavering public support for israel and sensitivity towards the jewish community .
it comes amid growing concern about the rise of the extreme right after electoral gains by the french national front leader jean-marie le pen and the party of murdered dutch rightist pim fortuyn , as well as the anti-immigration national front in local elections in the united kingdom .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was also the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .
seventy-seven percent were unaware what was discussed at the wannsee conference , where the so-called ' final solution ' to exterminate jews was mapped out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accusations of anti-semitism overshadow middle east visit would-be german foreign minister guido westerwelle has begun a visit to israel at the most inconvenient time .

walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .

walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .

walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany sticks his neck out on thursday night friedman , appearing on television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face in germany .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .
seventy-seven percent were unaware what was discussed at the wannsee conference , where the so-called ' final solution ' to exterminate jews was mapped out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accusations of anti-semitism overshadow middle east visit would-be german foreign minister guido westerwelle has begun a visit to israel at the most inconvenient time .

but a war of words is continuing between german jewish leaders and möllemann 's fdp . the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called a special sitting on friday in an effort to end the debate over controversial remarks by the deputy leader , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
his comments raised the stakes in a national debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , which was sparked by a similar accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon , whose military assault on palestinians he likened to the practices of the nazis .
on thursday night friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , appearing on german television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face .
" until recently , the voices of the extreme right wing were on the fringes of society , " friedman said .
" now they 're freely available from a petrol pump called the fdp .
möllemann is operating it , and westerwelle -lrb- fdp leader -rrb- , is the owner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany debate spreads germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- joined the fray on thursday urging the fdp to distance itself categorically from anti-semitism and rightwing extremism .
spd politicians said they would not work with the fdp in future unless it set itself apart from anti-jewish elements .
as the war of words continues to rage , the fdp says its popularity has not been affected by the controversy .
recent poll ratings of around twelve percent give the party a good chance of entering government later this year .
but the german chancellor gerhard schröder has described the anti-semitism debate as ' disastrous ' and has warned that it could harm germany 's international reputation .
" i do n't believe the fdp is an anti-semitic party , and i do n't actually think möllemann is an anti-semite " , the chancellor said .
but , he added , it would be dangerous if germany gave the impression that those of the jewish faith were not welcome .
the anti-semitism debate has raised questions over germany 's reputation as a country in which world war two guilt has mandated unwavering public support for israel and sensitivity towards the jewish community .
it comes amid growing concern about the rise of the extreme right after electoral gains by the french national front leader jean-marie le pen and the party of murdered dutch rightist pim fortuyn , as well as the anti-immigration national front in local elections in the united kingdom .

walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany sticks his neck out on thursday night friedman , appearing on television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face in germany .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .
seventy-seven percent were unaware what was discussed at the wannsee conference , where the so-called ' final solution ' to exterminate jews was mapped out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accusations of anti-semitism overshadow middle east visit would-be german foreign minister guido westerwelle has begun a visit to israel at the most inconvenient time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 germany 's anti-semitism debate continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy leader of the fdp : jürgen w. möllemann pressure mounts on top german liberal jürgen möllemann to apologize for remarks he made about a leading figure in the jewish community .
but a war of words is continuing between german jewish leaders and möllemann 's fdp . the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called a special sitting on friday in an effort to end the debate over controversial remarks by the deputy leader , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
his comments raised the stakes in a national debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , which was sparked by a similar accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon , whose military assault on palestinians he likened to the practices of the nazis .
on thursday night friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , appearing on german television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face .
" until recently , the voices of the extreme right wing were on the fringes of society , " friedman said .
" now they 're freely available from a petrol pump called the fdp .
möllemann is operating it , and westerwelle -lrb- fdp leader -rrb- , is the owner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany debate spreads germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- joined the fray on thursday urging the fdp to distance itself categorically from anti-semitism and rightwing extremism .
spd politicians said they would not work with the fdp in future unless it set itself apart from anti-jewish elements .
as the war of words continues to rage , the fdp says its popularity has not been affected by the controversy .
recent poll ratings of around twelve percent give the party a good chance of entering government later this year .
but the german chancellor gerhard schröder has described the anti-semitism debate as ' disastrous ' and has warned that it could harm germany 's international reputation .
" i do n't believe the fdp is an anti-semitic party , and i do n't actually think möllemann is an anti-semite " , the chancellor said .
but , he added , it would be dangerous if germany gave the impression that those of the jewish faith were not welcome .
the anti-semitism debate has raised questions over germany 's reputation as a country in which world war two guilt has mandated unwavering public support for israel and sensitivity towards the jewish community .
it comes amid growing concern about the rise of the extreme right after electoral gains by the french national front leader jean-marie le pen and the party of murdered dutch rightist pim fortuyn , as well as the anti-immigration national front in local elections in the united kingdom .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was also the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .

but a war of words is continuing between german jewish leaders and möllemann 's fdp . the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called a special sitting on friday in an effort to end the debate over controversial remarks by the deputy leader , jürgen möllemann .
möllemann , who is also head of the german-arab society , accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his ' intolerant , hateful style ' .
his comments raised the stakes in a national debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , which was sparked by a similar accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon , whose military assault on palestinians he likened to the practices of the nazis .
on thursday night friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , appearing on german television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face .
" until recently , the voices of the extreme right wing were on the fringes of society , " friedman said .
" now they 're freely available from a petrol pump called the fdp .
möllemann is operating it , and westerwelle -lrb- fdp leader -rrb- , is the owner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany debate spreads germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- joined the fray on thursday urging the fdp to distance itself categorically from anti-semitism and rightwing extremism .
spd politicians said they would not work with the fdp in future unless it set itself apart from anti-jewish elements .
as the war of words continues to rage , the fdp says its popularity has not been affected by the controversy .
recent poll ratings of around twelve percent give the party a good chance of entering government later this year .
but the german chancellor gerhard schröder has described the anti-semitism debate as ' disastrous ' and has warned that it could harm germany 's international reputation .
" i do n't believe the fdp is an anti-semitic party , and i do n't actually think möllemann is an anti-semite " , the chancellor said .
but , he added , it would be dangerous if germany gave the impression that those of the jewish faith were not welcome .
the anti-semitism debate has raised questions over germany 's reputation as a country in which world war two guilt has mandated unwavering public support for israel and sensitivity towards the jewish community .
it comes amid growing concern about the rise of the extreme right after electoral gains by the french national front leader jean-marie le pen and the party of murdered dutch rightist pim fortuyn , as well as the anti-immigration national front in local elections in the united kingdom .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was also the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.05.2002 german anti-semitism debate becomes a war of words großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author martin walser key german literary figures say martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' , is based on hatred , adding a new dimension to the national debate about anti-semitism . the furore surrounding german author martin walser 's novel ' death of a critic ' has deepened , with several key german literary figures joining the work 's numerous critics .
walter jens , ralph giordano , günter kunert and hellmuth karasek this week said walser , whose manuscript is about an author who murders a jewish book-reviewer , was probably motivated by a desire for revenge against the jewish-german critic marcel reich-ranicki .
reich-ranicki was especially known for hosting the literary programme " das literarische quarttet " on television .
reich-ranicki -lrb- photo -rrb- this week spoke out publicly for the first time about the text , describing it as " a patently anti-semitic outburst " .
he said the book was " atrocious literature " , and the worst writing walser had ever produced .
the berlin-based action against anti-semitism and anti-zionism has called the book " an unprecedented mockery of holocaust survivors " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literary critic marcel reich-ranicki is the subject of martin walser 's novel about the murder of a jewish-german book-reviewer , ' death of a critic ' .
the book 's publisher , suhrkamp , says it contains no underlying tone of anti-semitism .
walser has repeatedly rejected accusations that his novel is a murder fantasy .
he says the work is about " the use of power in the television age , seen from the point of view of the author " .
but the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , which refused to prepublish excerpts from the novel because of the anti-semitic clichés it contains , has received widespread support from the rest of the german media .
most newspaper editors agree that the character is clearly based on reich-ranicki and say walser 's book is slanderous .
publisher bernd lunkewitz has accused walser of deliberately provoking " a sensation to increase sales " .
is walser the möllemann of german literature ?
the controversy surrounding walser 's yet-to-be-published novel adds a new dimension to a national political and media debate about anti-semitism , sparked by controversial remarks by the deputy leader of the liberal democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- jürgen möllemann .
möllemann accused the vice-president of the central council of jews , michel friedman -lrb- photo -rrb- , of fuelling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style " .
his comments raised the stakes in a national political debate on whether the fdp was moving to the right , prompted by an earlier accusation möllemann had made against the israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michel friedman , vice-president , central council of jews in germany sticks his neck out on thursday night friedman , appearing on television , hit back at möllemann and his party , saying they were giving rightwing populism a respectable face in germany .
ignorance a form of denial ?
anti-semitism among the wider german population was the subject of a survey of more than two thousand university students in the german town of essen earlier this month .
the study found that one third supported an end to debates about nazi war crimes and the holocaust .
of those , more than sixty percent said they were in favour of a ' healthy national pride ' .
the authors of the study , essen university researchers professor klaus ahlheim and bardo heger , say the results show a kind of ' secondary anti-semitism ' exists among german students .
although only a tiny minority of respondents said they would not support the appointment of a jewish german president , seventeen percent said jewish people used their history to their advantage .
and one fifth said that jews took advantage of germany 's bad conscience .
ahlheim and heger say most respondents who said they were tired of being confronted with the past had a very poor knowledge of history .
nearly a third of respondents did not know the year the second world war began .
seventy-seven percent were unaware what was discussed at the wannsee conference , where the so-called ' final solution ' to exterminate jews was mapped out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accusations of anti-semitism overshadow middle east visit would-be german foreign minister guido westerwelle has begun a visit to israel at the most inconvenient time .

moody 's researchers blamed the downgrade , by two notches , on concerns over the government 's ability to solve japan 's economic malaise .
" the japan government 's current and anticipated economic policies will be insufficient to prevent continued deterioration in japan 's domestic problems , " moody 's said .
the levels of debt the government has run up , after years of attempting to kick-start economic revival through large infrastructure projects , meant it was testing new economic frontiers , friday 's report said .
" japan 's general government indebtedness ... will approach levels unprecedented in the post-war era in the developed world , and that as such japan will be entering ' uncharted territory ' . "
jobless data the news came as official data showed that the number of unemployed japanese workers hit 3.75 million last month , up 270,000 from a year before .
the figure represented the 13th successive monthly rise in unemployment , and defied a more optimistic outlook by many analysts , including those at the bank of japan , over the country 's economic prospects .
but many economists restated on friday that they expected an export-led recovery to ease unemployment problems .
" we believe in general the japanese economy hit the bottom in the first quarter of this year , " junichi makino , senior economist at daiwa institute of research , said .
" it usually takes three to four quarters for unemployment rate to come down after the overall economy bottoms out , " he added .
" we believe , by the end of this year , we will start seeing clear signs of the unemployment rate coming down . "
minister hits back many analysts also questioned moody 's decision to put japan sovereign debt to a2 , the same level as greece .
peter morgan , senior economist at hsbc securities , pointed to the level of consumer savings as evidence that moody 's case was overblown .
" japan still has quite a high savings rate so that means the fiscal deficit is easily covered by domestic savings , " mr morgan said .
and the decision was slammed by japanese finance minister masajuro shiokawa .
" they 're doing it for business , " mr shiokawa said .
" just because they do such things we wo n't change our policies . "
' boxcar ' economy yet japan 's future economic health is still viewed with concern by many observers , including us treasury secretary paul o 'neill , who earlier this month warned that the economy risked becoming a " boxcar " on the global racetrack .
and on thursday , the institute for international economics warned that japan could yet plunge into economic crisis .
" after more than a decade of economic stagnation and minimal structural change , japan stands on the brink of outright financial crisis , " said adam posen , senior fellow at the institute .
" the japanese economy is likely to tumble into crisis some time before ...
september . "
government ' inaction ' mr posen said that the government of prime minister junichiro koizumi had failed to tackle the failings of its predecessors since it took office two years ago .
" no decisive action has been taken , " he said .
but he said that crisis could be avoided by tackling problems such as japan 's debt-laden banks .
" a comprehensive policy package of bank closures and recapitalisation , money-financed bank of japan purchases of long-term government bonds and replacement of public works spending with tax cuts could still save the japanese economy .

the warning affirms the position of the australian economy as one of the world 's strongest , with growth hitting 3.6 % for 2001-02 , a year during which many other leading industrialised nations entered recession .
ian macfarlane , governor of the reserve bank of australia , told a parliamentary committee that there was a " high risk " of overheating unless tightening measures were introduced .

" it must give us confidence in the soundness of our economy , " he added .
investor reaction the warning of sharply higher rates , which in many other countries would have caused a sharp correction in stock prices , was received calmly in australian markets .
australian stocks stood 0.7 % lower in early afternoon on friday .
tony pearson , head of market economics at national australia bank , described mr macfarlane 's statement as " very aggressive " .

' our oil is mixed with our blood , ' one protester said local youth in the region 's main town of tizi ouzou spent thursday rioting in front of polling stations , throwing stones at security officials and burning tires .
children as young as 10 been taking part in the unrest .
anti-riot units and plain-clothes policemen threw some stones back and fired tear-gas at the demonstrators .
the clashes erupted on thursday morning when election officials tried to open polling stations .
state of siege for the past year protesters in the region had been in open conflict with the authorities , after a young student died while in custody of the security forces .
tear gas fumes filled the streets in tizi ouzou political leaders in kabylie have called for a boycott of the poll , a call that has been relayed in other parts of the country , especially in algiers .
the authorities have accused demonstrators in kabylie of using violence and intimidation to prevent potential voters from casting their ballots .
at a polling station set up in a primary school in the middle of one of tizi ouzou 's many council estates , the police were trying to drive demonstrators away using tear gas .
the school was in a state of siege , surrounded by angry protestors who kept pelting stones on the building .
elections officials had deserted the station and no one was there to cast their ballot .
the air was full of thick black smoke , mixed with the fumes of the tear gas canisters .
government accused some protesters accused the police of trying to bus strangers into kabylie to make them vote .
a local resident on the estate accused algeria 's government of making money out of the country 's oil wealth while killing youngsters in the region .
" our oil is mixed with our blood " , he said , accusing the international community of ignoring the plight of the algerian people .
local activists say that 117 people have been killed by the security forces in kabylie since the beginning of the trouble last year .
officials speak of only 80 dead .
thousands have been injured .
apart from the flashpoints around polling stations , tizi ouzou has been largely deserted .
its residents locked themselves up following a call for a four-day general strike .
fighting ' for democracy ' a young protester i met in the city 's main square insisted that their revolt should now spread to the rest of the country .
the area has been plagued by violence for more than a year " algeria 's problems come from the country 's generals , " he said .
" if people riot in the south , west and centre of the country , they will have to go . "
most protesters insist that they are algerians before being kabyles .
but the authorities have been trying to portray the current turmoil as a purely kabyle issue .
demonstrators insist that they are fighting for democracy , for justice and for jobs , not only for the recognition of their culture and their berber language , tamazight .
further clashes villages outside tizi ouzou have also been cut off from the rest of the region , and tree trunks and stones have been place across the roads .
in one instance , demonstrators even dug a trench across the road to prevent police vehicles from reaching their village .
clashes also erupted in several other towns of the region .
violence has been rocking the region for more than a year now .

the guide , which contains advice on benefits , education , transport and equipment will be unveiled by the minister for social development , nigel dodds , in belfast .
speaking before the mobility 2002 show , mr dodds said the guide would ensure that disabled people were aware of their rights .
" it is a signpost to the services that are available from a number of organisations . " he said .
nigel dodds : " this guide points people in the right direction " " it gives information on everything from cold weather payments to child benefit , from housing to holidays and from transport to tax . "
there are estimated to be about 300,000 people with disabilities in northern ireland .
the scheme is a joint venture between the social security agency and disability action .
" it is ironic that people with disabilities are among those most in need of help and yet quite often they have the most difficulty accessing the help available , " added the minister .
' invaluable resource ' " access to information can mean the difference between getting the help you need and , on the other hand , being unaware of your entitlement and rights .
that is why this guide is so important - it points people in the right direction . "
monica wilson , chief executive of disability action , said the booklet would prove to be " an invaluable resource for disabled people , carers , families and professionals in northern ireland " .
the a-z guide for people with disabilities is available in audiotape format and some copies in braille and can be obtained from the motoboility 2002 show at the king 's hall .
copies are also available from social security offices across the province or by phoning the free phone number 0800 052 4041 and text phone 0800 052 8090 .

six people were sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for taking part in an apparent coup plot in january 2001 which , according to government sources , involved a black limousine being chased away from northern ivory coast by government aircraft .
defence lawyers said the trial was politically motivated .
in the popular imagination , fed by pro-government media , this was a trial that involved a column of cars led by a black mercedes that originated in a neighbouring northern state and was thwarted from overthrowing the government by the national air force .
this dramatic account is challenged by defence lawyers and opposition sources .
they say the trial is part of a wider malaise which is the continuing tension between the ivory coast government and the mainly muslim northern-based opposition party , which has inevitable links with countries to the north .
calm then coup until 1999 ivory coast was a haven of calm in the turbulent west african region .
but then a coup d 'etat changed all that .
the coup was partly caused by the exclusion from a presidential election of the main opposition leader , who is a northern muslim .
during the last year stability has begun to return , with bodies like the international monetary fund encouraging ivory coast - a major west african economy - back into the fold of stable countries .
but opposition leaders say this trial is evidence of continuing domestic tension that will not go away until there are completely free elections that include all political parties .
