so he volunteered .
" i told them i 'd like to organize it , but that , as a tractor and agricultural machinery salesman , i 'd be laughed at if i went to the mayor and offered to rebuild the palace , " boddien explains . " the mayor would leave me standing there and walk away laughing .
now , however , there are millions of people supporting our project , tens of thousands donate money or are helping us with practical work , " wilhelm von boddien continues .
boddin 's lobbying has paid off .
today , boddien is the authority on anything to do with rebuilding the palace .
the days when people called him a monarchist are long gone .
" they told me that since my name is wilhelm , and i have an aristocratic von in my name , i needed the palace to call myself william the iii .
it 's quite amusing . "
von boddien has learnt how best to market his vision .
he does not want the palace rebuilt completely - just the facade .
the rooms behind it should be modern .
the berlin stadtschloss society plans to reconstruct three of the palace 's baroque facades and the what it considers the most valuable part of the structure , the courtyard designed by architect andreas schlüter .
according to boddien , this complex was one of the greatest examples of baroque architecture in germany .
future use wilhelm von boddien 's plans for a future use of a rebuilt palace include a library , a conference hall , a government guest house and the museum for exotic art .
construction costs are estimated at just under 600 million us dollars .
" that means the state would have costs that are no higher than any other building project , " explains boddien .
illusion of a palace in the 1990 's , boddien tried to get the public used to the idea of rebuilding the palace .
he hired artists and architects who created a giant , life sized painting of the facade on plastic sheeting .
boddien then had this giant billboard installed in the original location for a few weeks .
that way people got an impression of what the rebuilt palace would look like .

many buildings that survived the bombing were torn down in the 1950s and 60s .
now berliners are debating whether to rebuild the prussian palace in the heart of the city . in the years since german reunification , every international architect of note seems to have wanted to put his or her mark on " the new berlin " .
designing a building in the german capital appears to be a matter of prestige .
be it one of the federal ministries , the chancellery or a corporate headquarter .
but many ordinary berliners do n't care much about the new architectural jewels .
they would like some of the old buildings back , which graced the city before the second world war .
the palace should be rebuilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historic view of the palace one of the most hotly debated projects is rebuilding the royal palace in downtown berlin , the so-called " stadtschloss " in which the prussian kings and german emperors resided .
for more than a year , berlin 's so-called " schlossplatz commission " pondered what to do .
the schlossplatz commission is made up of 17 art historians , experts in historical preservation and architects .
on wednesday , the commission recommended the palace should be rebuilt .
it is now up to the city of berlin and germany 's federal government to give the final go-ahead .
the cost of the reconstruction is estimated at 770 million euro -lrb- $ 688 million -rrb- .
the schlossplatz commission is due to present a financing plan on friday .
one idea is to generate the funds by selling shares .
destroyed by the communist regime the palace was largely destroyed during the war , but its remnants could have been saved and reconstructed after the fighting ended .
but after the war , the communist government of east germany decided to eradicate all traces of what it considered the city 's bourgeois past .
they blew up what was left of the palace .
shortly after german reunification in 1990 , some people began to promote the idea of rebuilding the royal palace .
the idea was controversial .
many architects and historians called it highly questionable because it would seem like trying to turn back the wheel of time .
berlin 's historic center the row over what to do with berlin 's historic center began when the wall fell .
the " schlossplatz commission " debated different options for the historic heart of the city for a year and concluded that the prussian palace should be reconstructed .
but even if the city of berlin decides to rebuild the palace , this will not end the row .
opponents say the whole endeavor is much too costly and there is simply no need for a building of this kind in berlin .
many people also think that the " palace of the republic " , which the east german government built in place of the historic structure in the 1970s should be preserved .
if berlin decides to rebuild the historic palace , the newer structure would have to be torn down .
" i want to see a solution that brings something new to the city , something no other european city has , " explains hannes swoboda , chairman of an organization called ' historic city center berlin ' .
" secondly , i can certainly imagine elements of the palace being reconstructed , provided that a forward-looking solution can be found .
a purely historical reconstruction , both inside and out , is not what we should be building for tomorrow . "
the old stadtschloss the " stadtschloss " was formerly situated at the end of the unter den linden boulevard .
communist east german leader walter ulbricht ordered the palace to be blown up after the second world war .
its foundations below the asphalt are all that 's left .
only the reconstruction of the palace , say opponents of the idea , would revive the old face of the city and give other structures and the avenue as a whole its true focus .
the ' palace of the republic ' what poses a problem , however , is former east germany 's communist parliament : after the communists blew up the imperial palace , they erected the so-called " palace of the republic " in its place .
east germany 's last prime minister , lothar de maizière , admits the glass and asbestos behemoth is n't very charming , but he 's angry about how east germany 's history is being discarded .
he thinks tearing down the " palace of the republic " would not do justice to the place this building has in the history of 20th century berlin . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : berlin - the resurrected capital change is the only constant in berlin .

the performance was echoed at korean memory chip leader samsung electronics , whose own net profits dropped 65 % .
intel 's performance was buoyed by its success over the holiday period , during which it hit its ambitious christmas sales forecasts thanks to stronger-than-expected demand for pcs , led by rampant price cutting .
but profits for the final three months of 2001 were still down 77 % on last year at $ 504m , while sales fell by 20 % on the year to $ 6.98bn.
the company said it planned to cut capital investment by nearly a quarter to $ 5.5bn this year , a move which is expected to spread gloom through the semiconductor industry .
in october , intel boosted investor sentiment towards semiconductor stocks by announcing that it was sticking to its $ 7.3bn capital spending plans for 2001 despite difficult market conditions .
intel 's shares closed slightly lower on tuesday before the company published its earnings statement , and fell by a further 38 cents in after-hours trade to $ 34.30 .
struggling through samsung 's performance reflects the tough 12 months through which the once-booming chip industry has had to work .
its profits of 403bn won -lrb- $ 310m ; £ 213m -rrb- for the fourth quarter were even worse than the full year , which dropped 51 % to 2,950bn won .
the two companies are market leaders in their respective spheres , and the performance of their competitors was even worse .
in the memory sector in particular , few apart from samsung managed to turn a profit in 2001 .
no recovery yet intel , which is predicting flat sales over the next three months , said there is no sign yet of a broad-based pick-up in global demand .
" as to how this bodes for the overall economy , the indicators remain weak and we 're continuing to be cautious , " general manager for intel northern europe john woodget told bbc news online .
intel recorded its strongest sales growth in eastern europe and the asia pacific region , while sales remained flat or declined slightly in the us and western europe .
" this is showing that the investment we 've made in the emerging markets is paying off , " said mr woodget .
internet equipment maker suffering in another sign that it remains too soon to sound the all clear for the technology sector , internet networks equipment maker juniper on tuesday reported a sharp drop in revenues .
the company 's sales for final three months of 2001 fell by 49 % from the same period one year earlier to $ 151m .
juniper also reported losses of $ 5.1m for the period , down from a $ 62.2m profit during the final three months of 2000 .
