it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .
a prime example of such swords to plowshares projects is hahn airport , a former u.s. air force base that was converted into a civilian airport .

a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .

it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .
a prime example of such swords to plowshares projects is hahn airport , a former u.s. air force base that was converted into a civilian airport .
hahn is now the german hub for the fast-growing budget airline carrier ryanair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de military deployment : how do ordinary germans feel ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.05.2002 eu proposes radical reforms on fishing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's make or break time for eu fisheries , " said eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler .
a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .
" this year the european union ’ s 15 fisheries ministers will determine the future of our oceans , europe ’ s fishing communities and europe ’ s fish .
the ministers must stop the overfishing or fishing will be over , " said claude martin , director general of wwf international .

" like the commission , our central goal is to create a lasting and environmentally sensitive fishing industry , " german state secretary martin wille said during past discussions about reforms .
germany , with a fleet of 2,300 boats , has a relatively small fishing industry .
spain leads protest mediterranean countries led by spain , the biggest beneficiary of the one billion euro a year eu policy , are the prime opposition .
spain , portugal , france , italy and ireland have formed a group called the " friends of fishing " that blames industrial fishing by nordic countries , mainly to produce fishmeal , for the crisis .
spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .
" over-capacity is the enemy " fischler also proposed replacing the annual political haggling to set the year 's catch quotas with multi-year programs , which scientists say will better protect stocks .
the commissioner , who comes from austria , said : " the desperate race for fish has to stop .
over-capacity is the enemy – not only of the fish stocks , but also of the future of our fishermen . "
fischler also called for the increased use of satellites for tracking boats and a european inspection agency to enforce the rules .

a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .
" this year the european union ’ s 15 fisheries ministers will determine the future of our oceans , europe ’ s fishing communities and europe ’ s fish .
the ministers must stop the overfishing or fishing will be over , " said claude martin , director general of wwf international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , support for the changes comes mainly from northern european countries , including germany .
" like the commission , our central goal is to create a lasting and environmentally sensitive fishing industry , " german state secretary martin wille said during past discussions about reforms .
germany , with a fleet of 2,300 boats , has a relatively small fishing industry .
spain leads protest mediterranean countries led by spain , the biggest beneficiary of the one billion euro a year eu policy , are the prime opposition .
spain , portugal , france , italy and ireland have formed a group called the " friends of fishing " that blames industrial fishing by nordic countries , mainly to produce fishmeal , for the crisis .
spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .
" over-capacity is the enemy " fischler also proposed replacing the annual political haggling to set the year 's catch quotas with multi-year programs , which scientists say will better protect stocks .
the commissioner , who comes from austria , said : " the desperate race for fish has to stop .
over-capacity is the enemy – not only of the fish stocks , but also of the future of our fishermen . "
fischler also called for the increased use of satellites for tracking boats and a european inspection agency to enforce the rules .
and in an attempt to avoid entangling dolphins and seabirds , boats would have to invest in more tightly meshed nets .
the eu fisheries ministers will discuss the plan at a june meeting in luxemburg .
danish minister for food , marian fishir boel , was hopeful that the proposals could be adopted under the danish eu presidency , which begins in july .
british fisheries minister elliot morley agreed it was time for change but told bbc radio there would be tough talks ahead .
" the common fisheries policy has really failed to deliver in terms of conservation and it does need to be reformed , " he said .
meanwhile , the negotiation process leading up to the proposed reforms has brought uncertainty to the fishing industry .
and this is taking a human toll , fisherman alvaro reis of portugal told reuters .
" i have three sons , " he said , " and none of them wants to fish . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fishing the life out of the north sea europe ’ s environment ministers discuss the future of the north sea in bergen , norway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2002 global defense spending surges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional conflicts are fueling cold war-scale military outlays in the wake of september 11 , military spending is on the rise across the globe .
a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .
a prime example of such swords to plowshares projects is hahn airport , a former u.s. air force base that was converted into a civilian airport .
hahn is now the german hub for the fast-growing budget airline carrier ryanair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de military deployment : how do ordinary germans feel ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2002 piecing together the kaliningrad puzzle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fish from the heavily polluted baltic sea is the staple in kaliningrad the eu-russia summit failed to agree today on visa-free travel for kaliningrad - a russian enclave that will be in the middle of eu territory after enlargement . a lone crime-ridden russian island surrounded on all sides by eu territory – that ’ s what will happen once poland and lithuania join the european union .
it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2002 global defense spending surges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional conflicts are fueling cold war-scale military outlays in the wake of september 11 , military spending is on the rise across the globe .
a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .
a prime example of such swords to plowshares projects is hahn airport , a former u.s. air force base that was converted into a civilian airport .

a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .
a prime example of such swords to plowshares projects is hahn airport , a former u.s. air force base that was converted into a civilian airport .

back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .
a prime example of such swords to plowshares projects is hahn airport , a former u.s. air force base that was converted into a civilian airport .
hahn is now the german hub for the fast-growing budget airline carrier ryanair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de military deployment : how do ordinary germans feel ?

it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .
a prime example of such swords to plowshares projects is hahn airport , a former u.s. air force base that was converted into a civilian airport .
hahn is now the german hub for the fast-growing budget airline carrier ryanair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de military deployment : how do ordinary germans feel ?

a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .
a prime example of such swords to plowshares projects is hahn airport , a former u.s. air force base that was converted into a civilian airport .
hahn is now the german hub for the fast-growing budget airline carrier ryanair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de military deployment : how do ordinary germans feel ?

it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.05.2002 eu proposes radical reforms on fishing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's make or break time for eu fisheries , " said eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler .
a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .
" this year the european union ’ s 15 fisheries ministers will determine the future of our oceans , europe ’ s fishing communities and europe ’ s fish .
the ministers must stop the overfishing or fishing will be over , " said claude martin , director general of wwf international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , support for the changes comes mainly from northern european countries , including germany .
" like the commission , our central goal is to create a lasting and environmentally sensitive fishing industry , " german state secretary martin wille said during past discussions about reforms .
germany , with a fleet of 2,300 boats , has a relatively small fishing industry .
spain leads protest mediterranean countries led by spain , the biggest beneficiary of the one billion euro a year eu policy , are the prime opposition .
spain , portugal , france , italy and ireland have formed a group called the " friends of fishing " that blames industrial fishing by nordic countries , mainly to produce fishmeal , for the crisis .
spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .
" over-capacity is the enemy " fischler also proposed replacing the annual political haggling to set the year 's catch quotas with multi-year programs , which scientists say will better protect stocks .
the commissioner , who comes from austria , said : " the desperate race for fish has to stop .
over-capacity is the enemy – not only of the fish stocks , but also of the future of our fishermen . "
fischler also called for the increased use of satellites for tracking boats and a european inspection agency to enforce the rules .
and in an attempt to avoid entangling dolphins and seabirds , boats would have to invest in more tightly meshed nets .
the eu fisheries ministers will discuss the plan at a june meeting in luxemburg .
danish minister for food , marian fishir boel , was hopeful that the proposals could be adopted under the danish eu presidency , which begins in july .
british fisheries minister elliot morley agreed it was time for change but told bbc radio there would be tough talks ahead .
" the common fisheries policy has really failed to deliver in terms of conservation and it does need to be reformed , " he said .
meanwhile , the negotiation process leading up to the proposed reforms has brought uncertainty to the fishing industry .
and this is taking a human toll , fisherman alvaro reis of portugal told reuters .
" i have three sons , " he said , " and none of them wants to fish . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fishing the life out of the north sea europe ’ s environment ministers discuss the future of the north sea in bergen , norway .

a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .
" this year the european union ’ s 15 fisheries ministers will determine the future of our oceans , europe ’ s fishing communities and europe ’ s fish .
the ministers must stop the overfishing or fishing will be over , " said claude martin , director general of wwf international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , support for the changes comes mainly from northern european countries , including germany .
" like the commission , our central goal is to create a lasting and environmentally sensitive fishing industry , " german state secretary martin wille said during past discussions about reforms .
germany , with a fleet of 2,300 boats , has a relatively small fishing industry .
spain leads protest mediterranean countries led by spain , the biggest beneficiary of the one billion euro a year eu policy , are the prime opposition .
spain , portugal , france , italy and ireland have formed a group called the " friends of fishing " that blames industrial fishing by nordic countries , mainly to produce fishmeal , for the crisis .
spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .

once seen as a promising entrepreneurial newcomer in the turbulent economic landscape of the country 's former east german states , the scrappy startup was developing giant airships to transport heavy payloads over vast distances .
the enormous cl 160 blimp evoked the glory days of germany 's zeppelins , which plied the skies from berlin to lake constance during the early part of the 20th century .
a lack of working capital had already forced the berlin-based company to abandon its prestigious project .
cargolifter 's balloon of hope deflated even further on tuesday .
the company says it needs at least 70 million euro -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- to cover its financial commitments through autumn 2003 .
all efforts to secure an investment deal or a state-funded rescue package appear to have been in vain .
the company struck a deal earlier this month to work with u.s. aerospace giant boeing to develop commercial blimps , but few analysts feel the company will step in to save cargolifter .
insolvency proceedings are on hold for the time being as cargolifter hunts for a last-minute bailout .
the company 's shares lost eight percent on tuesday before being suspended from further trading . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cargolifter stranded financially strapped german airship developer cargolifter announced friday it has temporarily shelved plans to build its touted giant freight dirigible .

it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2002 piecing together the kaliningrad puzzle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fish from the heavily polluted baltic sea is the staple in kaliningrad the eu-russia summit failed to agree today on visa-free travel for kaliningrad - a russian enclave that will be in the middle of eu territory after enlargement . a lone crime-ridden russian island surrounded on all sides by eu territory – that ’ s what will happen once poland and lithuania join the european union .
it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .

a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .
a prime example of such swords to plowshares projects is hahn airport , a former u.s. air force base that was converted into a civilian airport .

a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .

it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .
" this year the european union ’ s 15 fisheries ministers will determine the future of our oceans , europe ’ s fishing communities and europe ’ s fish .
the ministers must stop the overfishing or fishing will be over , " said claude martin , director general of wwf international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , support for the changes comes mainly from northern european countries , including germany .
" like the commission , our central goal is to create a lasting and environmentally sensitive fishing industry , " german state secretary martin wille said during past discussions about reforms .
germany , with a fleet of 2,300 boats , has a relatively small fishing industry .
spain leads protest mediterranean countries led by spain , the biggest beneficiary of the one billion euro a year eu policy , are the prime opposition .
spain , portugal , france , italy and ireland have formed a group called the " friends of fishing " that blames industrial fishing by nordic countries , mainly to produce fishmeal , for the crisis .
spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .
" over-capacity is the enemy " fischler also proposed replacing the annual political haggling to set the year 's catch quotas with multi-year programs , which scientists say will better protect stocks .
the commissioner , who comes from austria , said : " the desperate race for fish has to stop .
over-capacity is the enemy – not only of the fish stocks , but also of the future of our fishermen . "
fischler also called for the increased use of satellites for tracking boats and a european inspection agency to enforce the rules .
and in an attempt to avoid entangling dolphins and seabirds , boats would have to invest in more tightly meshed nets .
the eu fisheries ministers will discuss the plan at a june meeting in luxemburg .
danish minister for food , marian fishir boel , was hopeful that the proposals could be adopted under the danish eu presidency , which begins in july .
british fisheries minister elliot morley agreed it was time for change but told bbc radio there would be tough talks ahead .
" the common fisheries policy has really failed to deliver in terms of conservation and it does need to be reformed , " he said .
meanwhile , the negotiation process leading up to the proposed reforms has brought uncertainty to the fishing industry .
and this is taking a human toll , fisherman alvaro reis of portugal told reuters .
" i have three sons , " he said , " and none of them wants to fish . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fishing the life out of the north sea europe ’ s environment ministers discuss the future of the north sea in bergen , norway .

once seen as a promising entrepreneurial newcomer in the turbulent economic landscape of the country 's former east german states , the scrappy startup was developing giant airships to transport heavy payloads over vast distances .
the enormous cl 160 blimp evoked the glory days of germany 's zeppelins , which plied the skies from berlin to lake constance during the early part of the 20th century .
a lack of working capital had already forced the berlin-based company to abandon its prestigious project .
cargolifter 's balloon of hope deflated even further on tuesday .
the company says it needs at least 70 million euro -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- to cover its financial commitments through autumn 2003 .
all efforts to secure an investment deal or a state-funded rescue package appear to have been in vain .
the company struck a deal earlier this month to work with u.s. aerospace giant boeing to develop commercial blimps , but few analysts feel the company will step in to save cargolifter .
insolvency proceedings are on hold for the time being as cargolifter hunts for a last-minute bailout .
the company 's shares lost eight percent on tuesday before being suspended from further trading . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cargolifter stranded financially strapped german airship developer cargolifter announced friday it has temporarily shelved plans to build its touted giant freight dirigible .

a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.05.2002 eu proposes radical reforms on fishing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's make or break time for eu fisheries , " said eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler .
a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .
" this year the european union ’ s 15 fisheries ministers will determine the future of our oceans , europe ’ s fishing communities and europe ’ s fish .
the ministers must stop the overfishing or fishing will be over , " said claude martin , director general of wwf international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , support for the changes comes mainly from northern european countries , including germany .
" like the commission , our central goal is to create a lasting and environmentally sensitive fishing industry , " german state secretary martin wille said during past discussions about reforms .
germany , with a fleet of 2,300 boats , has a relatively small fishing industry .
spain leads protest mediterranean countries led by spain , the biggest beneficiary of the one billion euro a year eu policy , are the prime opposition .
spain , portugal , france , italy and ireland have formed a group called the " friends of fishing " that blames industrial fishing by nordic countries , mainly to produce fishmeal , for the crisis .
spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .
" over-capacity is the enemy " fischler also proposed replacing the annual political haggling to set the year 's catch quotas with multi-year programs , which scientists say will better protect stocks .
the commissioner , who comes from austria , said : " the desperate race for fish has to stop .
over-capacity is the enemy – not only of the fish stocks , but also of the future of our fishermen . "
fischler also called for the increased use of satellites for tracking boats and a european inspection agency to enforce the rules .
and in an attempt to avoid entangling dolphins and seabirds , boats would have to invest in more tightly meshed nets .
the eu fisheries ministers will discuss the plan at a june meeting in luxemburg .
danish minister for food , marian fishir boel , was hopeful that the proposals could be adopted under the danish eu presidency , which begins in july .
british fisheries minister elliot morley agreed it was time for change but told bbc radio there would be tough talks ahead .
" the common fisheries policy has really failed to deliver in terms of conservation and it does need to be reformed , " he said .
meanwhile , the negotiation process leading up to the proposed reforms has brought uncertainty to the fishing industry .
and this is taking a human toll , fisherman alvaro reis of portugal told reuters .
" i have three sons , " he said , " and none of them wants to fish . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fishing the life out of the north sea europe ’ s environment ministers discuss the future of the north sea in bergen , norway .

once seen as a promising entrepreneurial newcomer in the turbulent economic landscape of the country 's former east german states , the scrappy startup was developing giant airships to transport heavy payloads over vast distances .
the enormous cl 160 blimp evoked the glory days of germany 's zeppelins , which plied the skies from berlin to lake constance during the early part of the 20th century .
a lack of working capital had already forced the berlin-based company to abandon its prestigious project .
cargolifter 's balloon of hope deflated even further on tuesday .
the company says it needs at least 70 million euro -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- to cover its financial commitments through autumn 2003 .
all efforts to secure an investment deal or a state-funded rescue package appear to have been in vain .
the company struck a deal earlier this month to work with u.s. aerospace giant boeing to develop commercial blimps , but few analysts feel the company will step in to save cargolifter .
insolvency proceedings are on hold for the time being as cargolifter hunts for a last-minute bailout .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , support for the changes comes mainly from northern european countries , including germany .
" like the commission , our central goal is to create a lasting and environmentally sensitive fishing industry , " german state secretary martin wille said during past discussions about reforms .
germany , with a fleet of 2,300 boats , has a relatively small fishing industry .
spain leads protest mediterranean countries led by spain , the biggest beneficiary of the one billion euro a year eu policy , are the prime opposition .
spain , portugal , france , italy and ireland have formed a group called the " friends of fishing " that blames industrial fishing by nordic countries , mainly to produce fishmeal , for the crisis .
spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .
" over-capacity is the enemy " fischler also proposed replacing the annual political haggling to set the year 's catch quotas with multi-year programs , which scientists say will better protect stocks .
the commissioner , who comes from austria , said : " the desperate race for fish has to stop .
over-capacity is the enemy – not only of the fish stocks , but also of the future of our fishermen . "
fischler also called for the increased use of satellites for tracking boats and a european inspection agency to enforce the rules .
and in an attempt to avoid entangling dolphins and seabirds , boats would have to invest in more tightly meshed nets .
the eu fisheries ministers will discuss the plan at a june meeting in luxemburg .
danish minister for food , marian fishir boel , was hopeful that the proposals could be adopted under the danish eu presidency , which begins in july .

a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2002 global defense spending surges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional conflicts are fueling cold war-scale military outlays in the wake of september 11 , military spending is on the rise across the globe .
a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .
a prime example of such swords to plowshares projects is hahn airport , a former u.s. air force base that was converted into a civilian airport .
hahn is now the german hub for the fast-growing budget airline carrier ryanair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de military deployment : how do ordinary germans feel ?

spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .
" over-capacity is the enemy " fischler also proposed replacing the annual political haggling to set the year 's catch quotas with multi-year programs , which scientists say will better protect stocks .
the commissioner , who comes from austria , said : " the desperate race for fish has to stop .
over-capacity is the enemy – not only of the fish stocks , but also of the future of our fishermen . "
fischler also called for the increased use of satellites for tracking boats and a european inspection agency to enforce the rules .
and in an attempt to avoid entangling dolphins and seabirds , boats would have to invest in more tightly meshed nets .
the eu fisheries ministers will discuss the plan at a june meeting in luxemburg .
danish minister for food , marian fishir boel , was hopeful that the proposals could be adopted under the danish eu presidency , which begins in july .
british fisheries minister elliot morley agreed it was time for change but told bbc radio there would be tough talks ahead .
" the common fisheries policy has really failed to deliver in terms of conservation and it does need to be reformed , " he said .
meanwhile , the negotiation process leading up to the proposed reforms has brought uncertainty to the fishing industry .
and this is taking a human toll , fisherman alvaro reis of portugal told reuters .
" i have three sons , " he said , " and none of them wants to fish . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fishing the life out of the north sea europe ’ s environment ministers discuss the future of the north sea in bergen , norway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2002 piecing together the kaliningrad puzzle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fish from the heavily polluted baltic sea is the staple in kaliningrad the eu-russia summit failed to agree today on visa-free travel for kaliningrad - a russian enclave that will be in the middle of eu territory after enlargement . a lone crime-ridden russian island surrounded on all sides by eu territory – that ’ s what will happen once poland and lithuania join the european union .
it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.05.2002 global defense spending surges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regional conflicts are fueling cold war-scale military outlays in the wake of september 11 , military spending is on the rise across the globe .
a german think tank warns that the u.s. is the leader in a 960 billion euro defense spending spree that could lead us back to the 1980s . in its annual report , " conversion survey 2002 , " the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- warns that after a decade of shrinking , military spending is climbing fast .
" when it comes to the magnitude of military spending and planned increases , the united states is the lone global leader , " says michael brzoska , one of the report 's authors .
with a military budget of $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- in 2002 -lrb- up from $ 310 billion the previous year -rrb- , the united states spends almost eight times as much as japan , which spends $ 45 billion , the report states .
it spends nine times more than france , great britain and china , which each spend under $ 40 billion .
the gap is even greater between the u.s. and germany , which spends twelve times less at about $ 30 billion annually .
fueled by threat of terrorism total global spending on defense this year is expected to soar to $ 900 billion -lrb- 960 billion euros -rrb- , the report estimates .
the organization believes the u.s.-led war against terror is fueling that trend .
since september 11 , the u.s. alone has allocated an additional $ 10 billion to its pentagon budget .
and by 2007 , the u.s. says it wants to increase its overall defense spending to $ 469 billion .
the u.s. is not alone in its increased spending .
the report states that russia , china , india , pakistan and the arab states are also adding to their annual military expenditures .
back to the ' 80s the upward trend marks a dramatic 180-degree turn from the peaceful gains of the mid- ' 80s and mid- ' 90s , when global military spending fell by 50 percent .
in recent years , it has climbed steadily .
with expected growth of five percent , the bicc says military spending this year will return to its 1992 levels .
and if the trend continues , spending could soon return to its 1987 historical peak by 2010 .
the bicc notes that europe does not appear to be following the american trend , despite pleas made by president george w. bush for nato partners to increase military spending .
such increases are unlikely in europe right now , with tight national budgets and a preference for conversion rather than expansion of military capabilities in many eu countries .
in germany during the 1990s , conversion and demobilization programs led to a 50 percent reduction in the country 's military spending .
a prime example of such swords to plowshares projects is hahn airport , a former u.s. air force base that was converted into a civilian airport .
hahn is now the german hub for the fast-growing budget airline carrier ryanair . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de military deployment : how do ordinary germans feel ?

once seen as a promising entrepreneurial newcomer in the turbulent economic landscape of the country 's former east german states , the scrappy startup was developing giant airships to transport heavy payloads over vast distances .
the enormous cl 160 blimp evoked the glory days of germany 's zeppelins , which plied the skies from berlin to lake constance during the early part of the 20th century .
a lack of working capital had already forced the berlin-based company to abandon its prestigious project .

the company says it needs at least 70 million euro -lrb- $ 65 million -rrb- to cover its financial commitments through autumn 2003 .
all efforts to secure an investment deal or a state-funded rescue package appear to have been in vain .
the company struck a deal earlier this month to work with u.s. aerospace giant boeing to develop commercial blimps , but few analysts feel the company will step in to save cargolifter .

a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .
" this year the european union ’ s 15 fisheries ministers will determine the future of our oceans , europe ’ s fishing communities and europe ’ s fish .
the ministers must stop the overfishing or fishing will be over , " said claude martin , director general of wwf international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , support for the changes comes mainly from northern european countries , including germany .
" like the commission , our central goal is to create a lasting and environmentally sensitive fishing industry , " german state secretary martin wille said during past discussions about reforms .
germany , with a fleet of 2,300 boats , has a relatively small fishing industry .
spain leads protest mediterranean countries led by spain , the biggest beneficiary of the one billion euro a year eu policy , are the prime opposition .
spain , portugal , france , italy and ireland have formed a group called the " friends of fishing " that blames industrial fishing by nordic countries , mainly to produce fishmeal , for the crisis .
spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .
" over-capacity is the enemy " fischler also proposed replacing the annual political haggling to set the year 's catch quotas with multi-year programs , which scientists say will better protect stocks .
the commissioner , who comes from austria , said : " the desperate race for fish has to stop .
over-capacity is the enemy – not only of the fish stocks , but also of the future of our fishermen . "
fischler also called for the increased use of satellites for tracking boats and a european inspection agency to enforce the rules .
and in an attempt to avoid entangling dolphins and seabirds , boats would have to invest in more tightly meshed nets .
the eu fisheries ministers will discuss the plan at a june meeting in luxemburg .
danish minister for food , marian fishir boel , was hopeful that the proposals could be adopted under the danish eu presidency , which begins in july .
british fisheries minister elliot morley agreed it was time for change but told bbc radio there would be tough talks ahead .
" the common fisheries policy has really failed to deliver in terms of conservation and it does need to be reformed , " he said .
meanwhile , the negotiation process leading up to the proposed reforms has brought uncertainty to the fishing industry .
and this is taking a human toll , fisherman alvaro reis of portugal told reuters .

spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .
" over-capacity is the enemy " fischler also proposed replacing the annual political haggling to set the year 's catch quotas with multi-year programs , which scientists say will better protect stocks .
the commissioner , who comes from austria , said : " the desperate race for fish has to stop .
over-capacity is the enemy – not only of the fish stocks , but also of the future of our fishermen . "
fischler also called for the increased use of satellites for tracking boats and a european inspection agency to enforce the rules .
and in an attempt to avoid entangling dolphins and seabirds , boats would have to invest in more tightly meshed nets .
the eu fisheries ministers will discuss the plan at a june meeting in luxemburg .
danish minister for food , marian fishir boel , was hopeful that the proposals could be adopted under the danish eu presidency , which begins in july .
british fisheries minister elliot morley agreed it was time for change but told bbc radio there would be tough talks ahead .
" the common fisheries policy has really failed to deliver in terms of conservation and it does need to be reformed , " he said .
meanwhile , the negotiation process leading up to the proposed reforms has brought uncertainty to the fishing industry .
and this is taking a human toll , fisherman alvaro reis of portugal told reuters .
" i have three sons , " he said , " and none of them wants to fish . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fishing the life out of the north sea europe ’ s environment ministers discuss the future of the north sea in bergen , norway .

a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .
" this year the european union ’ s 15 fisheries ministers will determine the future of our oceans , europe ’ s fishing communities and europe ’ s fish .
the ministers must stop the overfishing or fishing will be over , " said claude martin , director general of wwf international .

" like the commission , our central goal is to create a lasting and environmentally sensitive fishing industry , " german state secretary martin wille said during past discussions about reforms .

a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .
" this year the european union ’ s 15 fisheries ministers will determine the future of our oceans , europe ’ s fishing communities and europe ’ s fish .
the ministers must stop the overfishing or fishing will be over , " said claude martin , director general of wwf international .

it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.05.2002 eu proposes radical reforms on fishing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's make or break time for eu fisheries , " said eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler .
a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .
" this year the european union ’ s 15 fisheries ministers will determine the future of our oceans , europe ’ s fishing communities and europe ’ s fish .
the ministers must stop the overfishing or fishing will be over , " said claude martin , director general of wwf international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , support for the changes comes mainly from northern european countries , including germany .
" like the commission , our central goal is to create a lasting and environmentally sensitive fishing industry , " german state secretary martin wille said during past discussions about reforms .
germany , with a fleet of 2,300 boats , has a relatively small fishing industry .
spain leads protest mediterranean countries led by spain , the biggest beneficiary of the one billion euro a year eu policy , are the prime opposition .
spain , portugal , france , italy and ireland have formed a group called the " friends of fishing " that blames industrial fishing by nordic countries , mainly to produce fishmeal , for the crisis .
spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .
" over-capacity is the enemy " fischler also proposed replacing the annual political haggling to set the year 's catch quotas with multi-year programs , which scientists say will better protect stocks .
the commissioner , who comes from austria , said : " the desperate race for fish has to stop .
over-capacity is the enemy – not only of the fish stocks , but also of the future of our fishermen . "

a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .
" this year the european union ’ s 15 fisheries ministers will determine the future of our oceans , europe ’ s fishing communities and europe ’ s fish .
the ministers must stop the overfishing or fishing will be over , " said claude martin , director general of wwf international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , support for the changes comes mainly from northern european countries , including germany .
" like the commission , our central goal is to create a lasting and environmentally sensitive fishing industry , " german state secretary martin wille said during past discussions about reforms .
germany , with a fleet of 2,300 boats , has a relatively small fishing industry .
spain leads protest mediterranean countries led by spain , the biggest beneficiary of the one billion euro a year eu policy , are the prime opposition .
spain , portugal , france , italy and ireland have formed a group called the " friends of fishing " that blames industrial fishing by nordic countries , mainly to produce fishmeal , for the crisis .
spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .
" over-capacity is the enemy " fischler also proposed replacing the annual political haggling to set the year 's catch quotas with multi-year programs , which scientists say will better protect stocks .
the commissioner , who comes from austria , said : " the desperate race for fish has to stop .
over-capacity is the enemy – not only of the fish stocks , but also of the future of our fishermen . "
fischler also called for the increased use of satellites for tracking boats and a european inspection agency to enforce the rules .

it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .
restrictions on the time allowed for passage across eu soil and special sealed trains were further proposals .
but the european commission has termed the recommendations " unacceptable " .
visas are a matter of internal security , says brussels .
" it ’ s a question of security .
european union member states want to know who is on our territory , " a senior european commission official told reporters in brussels .
vested interests at play ?
there are also reports suggesting that eu officials would ask moscow at the summit to open negotiations on a " readmission agreement " under which it would undertake to take back illegal migrants and refused asylum seekers expelled from eu countries .
that , according to certain diplomats might lead to a trade-off between a kaliningrad solution and the readmission issue .
kaliningrad is not just a matter of national prestige to russian president putin , who is sticking to his guns over the issue and is determined to retain control of the territory .
once a major military asset , today kaliningrad is a stage where russian ’ s powerful energy industry play out its politics .
situated at the end of a natural pipeline , this strategic western-most port is the most lucrative way for russian companies to get into the eu markets .
eu taking more than a passing interest ?
but while it appears that the eu is now being forced to take a close interest in kaliningrad in view of its eastward expansion , brussels has ensured that it ’ s not just paying lip service to the region ’ s problems .
the eu has already committed over 40 million euro to kaliningrad to combat crime , pollution and disease .
in a meeting in kaliningrad on may 15 , 2002 , the eu outlined a package of measures to help the enclave .
they include working with russia to boost economic recovery in kaliningrad and assisting with border control and customs infrastructure to ease the issuing of visas and movement of goods . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it ’ s a scenario that ’ s causing jitters in brussels , for kaliningrad on the baltic sea – a relic of the cold war - is bordered by prospective eu members poland and lithuania .
so what will happen to this region - one-third the size of denmark and home to around 1 million people - after eu enlargement ?
the question has long been a sticking point between brussels and moscow .
today the two sides disagreed on visa-free travel for the kaliningrad enclave , an issue russian president vladimir putin said was a basic post-soviet right .
kaliningrad - going from bad to worse kaliningrad has not had it easy .
known as koenigsberg until the soviet union changed its name in 1946 – the city has historically been the stronghold of prussian kings .
it was battered by both the red army and the british royal force in the second world war before being occupied , resettled and renamed by stalin who needed a port for his baltic sea fleet .
during the height of the cold war , kaliningrad was a strong russian military base .
since the collapse of communism , the russian enclave has been riddled by organised crime , drug trafficking , prostitution and smuggling .
it is heavily polluted and crippled by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and diphtheria .
the region is also said to have the highest rate of hiv infection in europe .
though kaliningrad was declared a " free economic zone " in 1992 in the hope of attracting foreign investment , inconsistent economic policies pursued in russia have led to a general economic stagnation in the region .
eu eager to keep crumbling kaliningrad at arm 's length little wonder then that the eu ’ s biggest fear is the long-standing unrestricted movements of kalingrad ’ s residents and shuttle traders who regularly commute to neighbouring poland and lithuania .
both east european nations are prospective eu members and brussels is determined to clamp a more rigorous border control regime in place .
kaliningrad ’ s citizens are nonplussed by what they perceive as an attack on their freedom .
they are suddenly faced with the prospect of acquiring visas to open the eu gates – where earlier they could saunter into freely .
poland and lithuania have already tightened visa and trade policies with kaliningrad , in compliance with eu conditions for candidate countries .
the move has sparked allegations that the russian enclave is being further isolated .
visas a prickly issue the eu insists that russians will also have to have eu visas to enter and leave kaliningrad after enlargement , while moscow demands a right of free transit with visa-free travel through lithuania , which is expected to join the eu in 2004 . earlier this year the russian government presented a memorandum to romano prodi , president of the european commission which insisted on strictly regulated but visa-free travel along set transit routes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.05.2002 eu proposes radical reforms on fishing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's make or break time for eu fisheries , " said eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler .
a disputed plan to reform eu fishing would remove thousands of fishing vessels from european seas in an attempt to save threatened fish stocks and create a sustainable industry .
but mediterranean countries cry foul . after months of internal bargaining , the european commission on tuesday proposed the first major overhaul of europe ’ s fisheries policy in decades .
the changes , aimed at saving fish stocks near extinction and ensuring sustainable fisheries , would slash the eu fleet and cost thousands of jobs .
the bitterly disputed plan to reform the common fisheries policy would cut the total time eu trawlers spend at sea by between 30 and 60 per cent , depending on the region and state of local fish stocks .
it would mean the withdrawal of an estimated 8,600 vessels , representing 8.5 per cent of the eu fleet .
tens of thousands of the bloc 's 260,000 fishermen face an uncertain future – and critics say the plan could mean the loss of 28,000 jobs across europe .
eu fisheries commissioner franz fischler said , however , that the changes are crucial .
" it 's make or break time for eu fisheries .
if we want to give our fishermen a future , we need a new common fisheries policy .
either we have the courage to make bold reforms now , or we watch the demise of our fisheries sectors in the years ahead . "
the plans would free up some 460 million euros earmarked for vessel renewal and fleet moderization to help fishermen find jobs in other industries .
and some 272 million euros would be available for emergency ship scrapping between 2003 and 2006 .
warning from environmentalists scientists have warned for years that some fish stocks have fallen to dangerously low levels .
emergency measures are already in place to save north sea cod stocks .
and earlier this year , the world wildlife fund launched a campaign for radical reform of europe ’ s fisheries policy .
" this year the european union ’ s 15 fisheries ministers will determine the future of our oceans , europe ’ s fishing communities and europe ’ s fish .
the ministers must stop the overfishing or fishing will be over , " said claude martin , director general of wwf international .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : within the eu , support for the changes comes mainly from northern european countries , including germany .
" like the commission , our central goal is to create a lasting and environmentally sensitive fishing industry , " german state secretary martin wille said during past discussions about reforms .
germany , with a fleet of 2,300 boats , has a relatively small fishing industry .
spain leads protest mediterranean countries led by spain , the biggest beneficiary of the one billion euro a year eu policy , are the prime opposition .
spain , portugal , france , italy and ireland have formed a group called the " friends of fishing " that blames industrial fishing by nordic countries , mainly to produce fishmeal , for the crisis .
spanish opposition came from the highest levels and has prompted allegations of illegal intervention into commission matters .
last month , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar called commission president romano prodi about the issue .
and commission vice president loyola de palacio , a former spanish fisheries minister , wrote to fischler that the reforms brutally ignore the " conditions of life and work of our fishermen . "
on tuesday , prodi publicly endorsed the proposals in a statement stressing that their adoption " once again demonstrates that the commission acts in the common european interest . "
provisions that excluded spanish and portuguese fishermen from northern european waters will expire at the end of this year under the proposed reforms .
however , fishing rights for sought-after cod and haddock from the north sea and the baltic are already allocated to other eu states , effectively limiting their catch to less desirable fish .
" over-capacity is the enemy " fischler also proposed replacing the annual political haggling to set the year 's catch quotas with multi-year programs , which scientists say will better protect stocks .
the commissioner , who comes from austria , said : " the desperate race for fish has to stop .
over-capacity is the enemy – not only of the fish stocks , but also of the future of our fishermen . "
fischler also called for the increased use of satellites for tracking boats and a european inspection agency to enforce the rules .
and in an attempt to avoid entangling dolphins and seabirds , boats would have to invest in more tightly meshed nets .
the eu fisheries ministers will discuss the plan at a june meeting in luxemburg .
danish minister for food , marian fishir boel , was hopeful that the proposals could be adopted under the danish eu presidency , which begins in july .
british fisheries minister elliot morley agreed it was time for change but told bbc radio there would be tough talks ahead .
" the common fisheries policy has really failed to deliver in terms of conservation and it does need to be reformed , " he said .
meanwhile , the negotiation process leading up to the proposed reforms has brought uncertainty to the fishing industry .
and this is taking a human toll , fisherman alvaro reis of portugal told reuters .

emergency services , including mountain rescue teams , were involved in a four-hour operation at llaneglwys after chloe patel fell 15 feet down the gorge , injuring her spine .
but rescue efforts were held up by high winds and rain and the steep terrain .
it is believed the girl was with a group staying at an outdoor pursuits centre , but it is not known why they were out walking so late .
chloe patel was at an oudoor pursuits centre inspector terry davies of dyfed-powys police said rescuers had put their own safety at risk during the operation .
at one stage emergency services considered the risky use of a helicopter above the treeline to winch the girl out of the hole , said insp davies .
but mountain rescue workers were able to move the girl out of the gorge and she was found to be conscious and breathing .
a hospital spokesperson said she was in a comfortable condition .
rescuer mark jones said chloe had been moved out of the water to protect her from the cold .
she was flown by helicopter from raf chivenor to morriston hospital in swansea , where tests were carried out to assess the extent of her spinal injuries .
it is understood the teenager was injured after falling from a rope slide across a ravine , while making a second crossing without a harness .
" there was atrocious weather and high winds but because of the situation and the age of the child they wanted to ensure she was okay .
the accident took place on an adventure holiday " we 're talking about very steep contours .
it was very dangerous especially with the weather conditions .
the mountain rescue did a great job . "
mr davies added : " when they did eventually get the stretcher out , mountain rescue got her out by hand .
" they had to make their way across the fields to where the landing stretch was for the helicopter . "
the child 's parents were contacted and are driving to her bedside from the family home in hemel hempstead , hertfordshire .
an investigation will begin on wednesday with the health and safety executive to discover why the party was walking near the brecon beacons national park so late at night . watch / listen on this story bbc wales 's melanie doel " the rescuers had to manhandle the girl up the ravine from the stream " see also : 16 may 02 -pipe- wales rescuers continue walker search 18 mar 02 -pipe- wales drive to cut outdoor pursuits tragedies 19 may 02 -pipe- wales light plane crash-lands internet links : dyfed-powys police mountain safety - brecon beacons the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : boyfriend sought in murder inquiry girl will wait for jailed ' rapist ' lover cash boost for brecon jazz hello !

there were 31 births per 1,000 british girls aged between 15 and 19 in 1998 .
in the us the figure was 52 per 1,000 births .

there were 31 births per 1,000 british girls aged between 15 and 19 in 1998 .
in the us the figure was 52 per 1,000 births .
japan , korea , switzerland and the netherlands have the lowest teenage birth rates at fewer than seven per 1,000 .
the age at which british youngsters lose their virginity has fallen from 20 for men and 21 for women 40 years ago , to 17 for both sexes today .
the number of girls having underage sex has also doubled in the last 10 years , says the report .

in an effort to stem the tide of fleeing businesses and to bring others back , city and state officials have been pushing a commodity well known on wall street - cash .
a company relocating to downtown , the heart of new york 's financial district , may be eligible for millions of dollars in incentives as part of a concerted effort by local , state and federal governments to drive redevelopment .
despite the bonus , many firms displaced by the attacks have decided neighbouring communities surrounding manhattan are more attractive venues .
the world trade center complex housed more than 50,000 workers before suicidal hijackers slammed two airliners into them last september .
deadlines loom when officials gather thursday at 1029 edt -lrb- 1429 gmt -rrb- - the exact time when the second tower collapsed - to announce the end to the clean-up , they will be ushering in the movement to redevelop the area , since known as ground zero .
some fear the harmony and brotherhood that has been emblematic of the clean-up efforts will be lost among competing visions of what qualities a new world trade center should embody .
most contentious is likely to be the extent of a memorial to the 2,800 victims who perished when the towers collapsed .
a few surviving family member who had loved ones that died would like to see the entire area be made into memorial park - not a likely scenario .
design-firm beyer blinder belle has been selected to oversee the rebuilding of downtown .
the company is best known for its work on the restoration of grand central terminal as well as ellis island .
some deadlines are already in place .
by july , the design for a memorial is expected along with half a dozen plans for the trade centre site .
the proposals will be winnowed to one by december with an overall site design to be submitted in june 2003 .
construction is already set to begin next month on the land where 7 world trade center once stood - just north of ground zero .
stay or go ?
with businesses weighing numerous options , what will become of the 16-acre pit where buildings once stood remains to be seen .
some companies that formerly occupied the towers have scattered their operations in several offices in neighbouring new york counties and the states of new jersey and connecticut .
having satellite offices is a strategy more and more firms view as pragmatic following the terror attacks .
some point to the loss of 658 employees at bond-trader cantor fitzgerald , which occupied 250,000 square feet of space on five floors of the world trade center .
in march , cantor announced it was relocating many of the surviving employees to a temporary office in manhattan 's upper east side , after occupying several locations in new jersey , manhattan and connecticut .
other firms have elected to stay , rallying around wall street in the same way many americans have embraced the us flag as a show of patriotism .
earlier this month , financial-services giant american express reoccupied its headquarters at its building adjacent to the world trade center site at 3 world financial center .
the move followed a similar one by brokerage merrill lynch in march , which also has its offices in the world financial center .
financial centre also of concern is what is to become of the new york stock exchange -lrb- nyse -rrb- , which was set to begin building a new headquarters last november .
following the terror attacks , however , new york city is no longer able to afford the millions of dollars in subsidies once promised to the big board by former-mayor rudolph giuliani to fend off a defection to new jersey .
the city 's new mayor , billionaire michael bloomberg , has said he would like to see the nyse stay in lower manhattan .
at any rate , he said , " it is inconceivable to me that they would move out of town . "
" this is the big apple , " mayor bloomberg said .
" this is the world financial centre . "
that reasoning failed to influence another major stock exchange , the nasdaq , from announcing on tuesday that it , too , was abandoning lower manhattan for a midtown location .
nasdaq officials , however , noted their move had little to do with the september attacks .
rather , nasdaq is consolidating its operations in the city 's central business district where its premier nasdaq market site is already situated .

the superhero saga earned 67m rupees -lrb- £ 940,000 -rrb- in its first four days of release - and made more in its first weekend than any hollywood movie yet released in india . "
the word of mouth is electric for spider-man " uday singh , columbia tristar " it 's just amazing .
spider-man has rewritten all the previous records of foreign films , " said columbia tristar managing director uday singh .
the previous best performance for a foreign film in india was by the mummy returns , which grossed 42m rupees -lrb- £ 590,000 -rrb- in its opening weekend .
spider-man was released in india soon after its us debut on 3 may - allowing less time for pirate copies to circulate .
local languages the movie opened on friday in nearly 250 cinemas across the country .
it has also been released in three local languages - hindi , tamil and telugu - as well as english .
another factor in the film 's favour has been a lack of real competitors from bollywood .
the next major bollywood releases are hum kisise kum nahin -lrb- we are no less to anyone -rrb- starring legendary actor amitabh bachchan , which comes out on friday , and devdas -lrb- pining lover -rrb- , set for release on 28 june .
there is also much anticipation surrounding the release of three movies on legendary indian freedom fighter bhagat singh , the first of which will be in cinemas on 7 june .
but uday singh said columbia tristar would keep up their marketing campaign to maintain interest in spider-man , despite competition from bollywood .
" we will sustain the movie as long as the consumer wants .
" the word of mouth is electric for spider-man , with children being the key audience , " he said .
and an indian film business analyst said : " i do not see bollywood movies affecting spider-man at all - in fact spider-man has cast its web quite well and will eat into some of the biggest bollywood movies . "
