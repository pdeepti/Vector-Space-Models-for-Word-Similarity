but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .

their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money . the euro might have found a place in germans ’ wallets when cash machines started dispensing the bills on january 1st of this year , but the new money has yet to find a place in their hearts . a survey conducted by the european union commission of citizens of the 12 “ eurozone ” countries , states which have abandoned with previous national currencies for the euro , found that while half of europeans had embraced the currency , germans by far expressed the most dissatisfaction with the money that took the place of their beloved deutschmark . more than two thirds of germans -lrb- 67.8 percent -rrb- said they were dissatisfied or outright unhappy with the euro , the eu commission reported on thursday at a press conference taking stock of the euro ’ s acceptance as it approaches its one-year anniversary as a circulating currency . less than one third of germans expressed satisfaction with the new coins and bills . euro = “ teuro ” ? officials in brussels blame the lower acceptance rates in germany partly on the so-called “ teuro ” dabate that took place earlier this years .
the euro came to be popularly known by many as the “ teuro ” — a play on the german word for “ expensive ” — when some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .

after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .

after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "

their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money . the euro might have found a place in germans ’ wallets when cash machines started dispensing the bills on january 1st of this year , but the new money has yet to find a place in their hearts . a survey conducted by the european union commission of citizens of the 12 “ eurozone ” countries , states which have abandoned with previous national currencies for the euro , found that while half of europeans had embraced the currency , germans by far expressed the most dissatisfaction with the money that took the place of their beloved deutschmark . more than two thirds of germans -lrb- 67.8 percent -rrb- said they were dissatisfied or outright unhappy with the euro , the eu commission reported on thursday at a press conference taking stock of the euro ’ s acceptance as it approaches its one-year anniversary as a circulating currency . less than one third of germans expressed satisfaction with the new coins and bills . euro = “ teuro ” ? officials in brussels blame the lower acceptance rates in germany partly on the so-called “ teuro ” dabate that took place earlier this years .
the euro came to be popularly known by many as the “ teuro ” — a play on the german word for “ expensive ” — when some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
while analysts say actual overall price inflation was low -lrb- no more than 0.2 percent according to the eurostat statistics office -rrb- , real price hikes did occur in some food and service sectors , leading to a perception that the euro equalled less buying power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nostalgia for the old deutschmark also played a role in germans ’ less-than-adamant love affair with the new legal tender .
after the devastation of world war ii , for many the deutschmark symbolized the prosperity of the wirtschaftswunder , a strong german economy , and with it , a high level of security .
surrounded by unstable currencies like the italian lira or the french franc , the deutschmark proved itself time and again to be immune from severe fluctuations and runaway inflation . some retailers have taken advantage of this yearning for times past and have started accepting deutschmarks in their establishments again alongside the euro .
in the northern german town of kropp , almost all the businesses teamed up to run a campaign in november and december called “ the deutchmark is back . ”
people from the surrounding region have been pouring into shops in the town of 6,500 to spend their old deutschmarks , causing a mini economic boom that is the envy of the surrounding municipalities . better marks elsewhere overall , the eu reported on thursday that , in its estimation , the euro has been a success .
“ the successful changeover marked the beginning of a new era for europe , ” said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner .
many eu nations , particularly smaller ones , share his enthusiasm . nations with unstable , inflation-prone currencies like italy and greece were all too happy to join the european monetary project .
while the italians might complain that euro coins are too heavy , nearly one half -lrb- 49.7 percent -rrb- of europeans interviewed expressed basic satisfaction .
only 38.7 percent revealed negative feelings toward the euro one year on .
smaller nations , such as luxemburg , belgium and ireland , are the euro ’ s strongest advocates .
in these countries approval rates run over the 70 percent mark . psychological barriers despite the general levels of acceptance , the psychological changeover to the euro has yet to take place .
the survey found that only 42.2 percent of consumers calculate prices in euros .
most people still make mental calculations in their old currencies and then convert .
when it comes to big-ticket items like houses or cars , that percentage drops to 12.2 percent . one reason for this , officials in brussels say , is the dual display system used by many retailers which indicates prices in both euros and the old currency .
this double listing , which nearly half of consumers say they like , delays the mental changeover and could ever prove counterproductive , according to the eu .
the commission has called on retailers to end the practice by the end of july 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe goes euro three weeks after being introduced as europe ’ s common currency , the euro is enjoying an overwhelming acceptance , so much so in fact that sweden is considering joining the euro-zone .

in february germany , along with holland , takes over the leadership of the international security assistance force there . on friday , an overwhelming number of german parliamentarians voted to not only keep german troops on afghan soil for twelve more months , but also to double the number of soldiers patrolling this war-torn country struggling to put down democratic roots and establish the rule of law . the german parliament , the bundestag , voted 565 to nine to lengthen the military ’ s stay in the country , where it makes up part of a 22-nation peacekeeping force brought in to stabilize the capital kabul and the surrounding region after an american bombing campaign helped drive out the fundamentalist taliban regime last year . before friday ’ s vote , foreign minister joschka fischer stressed the importance of the military ’ s continuing presence in the region .
“ there is no alternative to international engagement in afghanistan if we want to learn from september 11 , ” fischer told parliamentarians , adding that the mission there would be a long and dangerous one . germany ’ s defense minister peter struck , a member of the governing social democrats , echoed those sentiments , saying the fight against international terrorism is far from over , evidenced by thursday ’ s grenade attack near the german base in kabul .
two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .
he called for isaf to concentrate on extending the relative stability enjoyed by the kabul region to the rest of the country , which is largely still under the control of regional warlords . the government however had rejected expanding the geographic region of its mandate beyond the area immediately around kabul . more to ship out the bundestag also agreed to double the number of german soldiers serving in afghanistan , from the current 1,300 to around 2,500 .
germany is scheduled to take over leadership of isaf forces along with holland in february , and the additional soldiers will be needed for that six-month responsibility , according to defense minister struck . although the support was widespread , there were a few voices of caution .
the defense spokeswoman for the green party , winfried nachwei , denied that germany ’ s taking over the isaf reins was a way of “ making up ” for not participating in a possible iraq war . one of the dissenting votes to the extension was petra pau , member of the pacifist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
she warned against making a decision to extend the mandate lightly , since in her opinion increasing the number of soldiers and taking on a leadership role put the operation on a new level .
the isaf ’ s success thus far , she said , has only been mediocre . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soldiers restore school in afghanistan german soldiers are helping refurbish a shattered school in a village near kabul , as rebuilding damaged infrastructure becomes an important task of the peacekeeping forces in afghanistan .

after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .
and what ’ s left ?

till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .
and what ’ s left ?
nothing but ruins and a poor image abroad .

their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money . the euro might have found a place in germans ’ wallets when cash machines started dispensing the bills on january 1st of this year , but the new money has yet to find a place in their hearts . a survey conducted by the european union commission of citizens of the 12 “ eurozone ” countries , states which have abandoned with previous national currencies for the euro , found that while half of europeans had embraced the currency , germans by far expressed the most dissatisfaction with the money that took the place of their beloved deutschmark . more than two thirds of germans -lrb- 67.8 percent -rrb- said they were dissatisfied or outright unhappy with the euro , the eu commission reported on thursday at a press conference taking stock of the euro ’ s acceptance as it approaches its one-year anniversary as a circulating currency . less than one third of germans expressed satisfaction with the new coins and bills . euro = “ teuro ” ? officials in brussels blame the lower acceptance rates in germany partly on the so-called “ teuro ” dabate that took place earlier this years .
the euro came to be popularly known by many as the “ teuro ” — a play on the german word for “ expensive ” — when some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
while analysts say actual overall price inflation was low -lrb- no more than 0.2 percent according to the eurostat statistics office -rrb- , real price hikes did occur in some food and service sectors , leading to a perception that the euro equalled less buying power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nostalgia for the old deutschmark also played a role in germans ’ less-than-adamant love affair with the new legal tender .
after the devastation of world war ii , for many the deutschmark symbolized the prosperity of the wirtschaftswunder , a strong german economy , and with it , a high level of security .
surrounded by unstable currencies like the italian lira or the french franc , the deutschmark proved itself time and again to be immune from severe fluctuations and runaway inflation . some retailers have taken advantage of this yearning for times past and have started accepting deutschmarks in their establishments again alongside the euro .
in the northern german town of kropp , almost all the businesses teamed up to run a campaign in november and december called “ the deutchmark is back . ”
people from the surrounding region have been pouring into shops in the town of 6,500 to spend their old deutschmarks , causing a mini economic boom that is the envy of the surrounding municipalities . better marks elsewhere overall , the eu reported on thursday that , in its estimation , the euro has been a success .
“ the successful changeover marked the beginning of a new era for europe , ” said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner .
many eu nations , particularly smaller ones , share his enthusiasm . nations with unstable , inflation-prone currencies like italy and greece were all too happy to join the european monetary project .
while the italians might complain that euro coins are too heavy , nearly one half -lrb- 49.7 percent -rrb- of europeans interviewed expressed basic satisfaction .
only 38.7 percent revealed negative feelings toward the euro one year on .
smaller nations , such as luxemburg , belgium and ireland , are the euro ’ s strongest advocates .
in these countries approval rates run over the 70 percent mark . psychological barriers despite the general levels of acceptance , the psychological changeover to the euro has yet to take place .
the survey found that only 42.2 percent of consumers calculate prices in euros .
most people still make mental calculations in their old currencies and then convert .
when it comes to big-ticket items like houses or cars , that percentage drops to 12.2 percent . one reason for this , officials in brussels say , is the dual display system used by many retailers which indicates prices in both euros and the old currency .

but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .

then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .

and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .

during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .

the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .

here , the government adopted the so-called " chancellor 's majority " - a method seen as a last resort to push through laws which have not been approved by the bundesrat - where it was finally voted through . the approval comes as a relief to the german government , after a turbulent week which saw various central elements of the hartz reform proposals up for implementation under severe criticism from the opposition . earlier this week , a proposal relating to the employment of temporary staff was rejected by the bundesrat , where the conservatives have a majority , and had to undergo the joint mediation committee representing both chambers of parliament before it was passed back to the bundesrat and bundestag at the end of this week . new " mini-jobs " regulation makes it worth working all three proposals are drawn from recommendations by the government-sponsored employment commission headed by former volkswagen manager peter hartz .

the minister for economy and labor , wolfgang clement , estimates this will create at least 300,000 new jobs . the plans will still cost money however , the plan does have its critics .

they were originally introduced to increase job security and force companies to offer contractually-regulated permanent employment . the relaxation of regulations governing mini-jobs and the conditions of self-employment represent an about-face for the government , which originally pushed them through against the protests of a business community which said they would lead to less , not more , employment . temp jobs a sticking point the third provision , relating to temporary employment , was the contentious one .
its main aim is to regulate the way private short-term employment agencies work , but the way temporary workers should be treated by companies is still a major cause of disagreement . both the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats want temporary jobs to be free of contractual constraint , but the government insists that temporary workers must be paid the same as permanent workers after six weeks at most .

their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money . the euro might have found a place in germans ’ wallets when cash machines started dispensing the bills on january 1st of this year , but the new money has yet to find a place in their hearts . a survey conducted by the european union commission of citizens of the 12 “ eurozone ” countries , states which have abandoned with previous national currencies for the euro , found that while half of europeans had embraced the currency , germans by far expressed the most dissatisfaction with the money that took the place of their beloved deutschmark . more than two thirds of germans -lrb- 67.8 percent -rrb- said they were dissatisfied or outright unhappy with the euro , the eu commission reported on thursday at a press conference taking stock of the euro ’ s acceptance as it approaches its one-year anniversary as a circulating currency . less than one third of germans expressed satisfaction with the new coins and bills . euro = “ teuro ” ? officials in brussels blame the lower acceptance rates in germany partly on the so-called “ teuro ” dabate that took place earlier this years .
the euro came to be popularly known by many as the “ teuro ” — a play on the german word for “ expensive ” — when some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
while analysts say actual overall price inflation was low -lrb- no more than 0.2 percent according to the eurostat statistics office -rrb- , real price hikes did occur in some food and service sectors , leading to a perception that the euro equalled less buying power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nostalgia for the old deutschmark also played a role in germans ’ less-than-adamant love affair with the new legal tender .
after the devastation of world war ii , for many the deutschmark symbolized the prosperity of the wirtschaftswunder , a strong german economy , and with it , a high level of security .
surrounded by unstable currencies like the italian lira or the french franc , the deutschmark proved itself time and again to be immune from severe fluctuations and runaway inflation . some retailers have taken advantage of this yearning for times past and have started accepting deutschmarks in their establishments again alongside the euro .
in the northern german town of kropp , almost all the businesses teamed up to run a campaign in november and december called “ the deutchmark is back . ”
people from the surrounding region have been pouring into shops in the town of 6,500 to spend their old deutschmarks , causing a mini economic boom that is the envy of the surrounding municipalities . better marks elsewhere overall , the eu reported on thursday that , in its estimation , the euro has been a success .
“ the successful changeover marked the beginning of a new era for europe , ” said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner .
many eu nations , particularly smaller ones , share his enthusiasm . nations with unstable , inflation-prone currencies like italy and greece were all too happy to join the european monetary project .
while the italians might complain that euro coins are too heavy , nearly one half -lrb- 49.7 percent -rrb- of europeans interviewed expressed basic satisfaction .
only 38.7 percent revealed negative feelings toward the euro one year on .
smaller nations , such as luxemburg , belgium and ireland , are the euro ’ s strongest advocates .
in these countries approval rates run over the 70 percent mark . psychological barriers despite the general levels of acceptance , the psychological changeover to the euro has yet to take place .
the survey found that only 42.2 percent of consumers calculate prices in euros .
most people still make mental calculations in their old currencies and then convert .
when it comes to big-ticket items like houses or cars , that percentage drops to 12.2 percent . one reason for this , officials in brussels say , is the dual display system used by many retailers which indicates prices in both euros and the old currency .
this double listing , which nearly half of consumers say they like , delays the mental changeover and could ever prove counterproductive , according to the eu .
the commission has called on retailers to end the practice by the end of july 2003 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe goes euro three weeks after being introduced as europe ’ s common currency , the euro is enjoying an overwhelming acceptance , so much so in fact that sweden is considering joining the euro-zone .

two of them see the government backtracking on previous labor policies a long way . the first three provisions of the german government ’ s far-reaching labor market reforms were approved by the german parliament , the bundestag on friday . after the bundesrat , the country ’ s upper house , rejected one of the proposals on friday , it was returned to the bundestag .
here , the government adopted the so-called " chancellor 's majority " - a method seen as a last resort to push through laws which have not been approved by the bundesrat - where it was finally voted through . the approval comes as a relief to the german government , after a turbulent week which saw various central elements of the hartz reform proposals up for implementation under severe criticism from the opposition . earlier this week , a proposal relating to the employment of temporary staff was rejected by the bundesrat , where the conservatives have a majority , and had to undergo the joint mediation committee representing both chambers of parliament before it was passed back to the bundesrat and bundestag at the end of this week . new " mini-jobs " regulation makes it worth working all three proposals are drawn from recommendations by the government-sponsored employment commission headed by former volkswagen manager peter hartz .
the one that has generated most enthusiasm is one which should make low-paid part-time jobs - so-called " mini-jobs " - more attractive .
it will exempt people earning less than 400 euros a month from making social welfare insurance contributions – until now , the cut-off point has been 325 euros . in addition , reduced contributions will be introduced for jobs paying less than 800 euros a month .
employers will also pay reduced contributions up to that limit .
the minister for economy and labor , wolfgang clement , estimates this will create at least 300,000 new jobs . the plans will still cost money however , the plan does have its critics .
according to the unions the new regulations will undermine sector wage settlements , while health insurers complain that the new jobs will lead to cuts in revenues .
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung this week quoted unnamed sources within the governing coalition as saying the mini-jobs could cost as much as a billion marks in lost tax revenues and contributions . the second provision is the withdrawal of the regulations defining the conditions under which a person can be counted as self-employed .
they were originally introduced to increase job security and force companies to offer contractually-regulated permanent employment . the relaxation of regulations governing mini-jobs and the conditions of self-employment represent an about-face for the government , which originally pushed them through against the protests of a business community which said they would lead to less , not more , employment . temp jobs a sticking point the third provision , relating to temporary employment , was the contentious one .
its main aim is to regulate the way private short-term employment agencies work , but the way temporary workers should be treated by companies is still a major cause of disagreement . both the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats want temporary jobs to be free of contractual constraint , but the government insists that temporary workers must be paid the same as permanent workers after six weeks at most .
the government said it was not prepared to make any changes to this provision and would force it through in spite of the bundesrat ’ s opposition . getting these employment provisions into law marks the government ’ s first major reform in this legislative period , one that it had made an integral part of its election campaign . “ we wanted to send out a call to positive action , ” said the social democrats ’ employment spokesman klaus brandner .

but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.12.2002 uncontrollable freedom in a parallel world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are incapable of controlling what goes on in internet chat rooms the recent cannibalism case in germany with its origins in the internet raises new questions about policing cyberspace .
but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .

after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .

the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .

their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money . the euro might have found a place in germans ’ wallets when cash machines started dispensing the bills on january 1st of this year , but the new money has yet to find a place in their hearts . a survey conducted by the european union commission of citizens of the 12 “ eurozone ” countries , states which have abandoned with previous national currencies for the euro , found that while half of europeans had embraced the currency , germans by far expressed the most dissatisfaction with the money that took the place of their beloved deutschmark . more than two thirds of germans -lrb- 67.8 percent -rrb- said they were dissatisfied or outright unhappy with the euro , the eu commission reported on thursday at a press conference taking stock of the euro ’ s acceptance as it approaches its one-year anniversary as a circulating currency . less than one third of germans expressed satisfaction with the new coins and bills . euro = “ teuro ” ? officials in brussels blame the lower acceptance rates in germany partly on the so-called “ teuro ” dabate that took place earlier this years .
the euro came to be popularly known by many as the “ teuro ” — a play on the german word for “ expensive ” — when some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
while analysts say actual overall price inflation was low -lrb- no more than 0.2 percent according to the eurostat statistics office -rrb- , real price hikes did occur in some food and service sectors , leading to a perception that the euro equalled less buying power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nostalgia for the old deutschmark also played a role in germans ’ less-than-adamant love affair with the new legal tender .
after the devastation of world war ii , for many the deutschmark symbolized the prosperity of the wirtschaftswunder , a strong german economy , and with it , a high level of security .
surrounded by unstable currencies like the italian lira or the french franc , the deutschmark proved itself time and again to be immune from severe fluctuations and runaway inflation . some retailers have taken advantage of this yearning for times past and have started accepting deutschmarks in their establishments again alongside the euro .
in the northern german town of kropp , almost all the businesses teamed up to run a campaign in november and december called “ the deutchmark is back . ”
people from the surrounding region have been pouring into shops in the town of 6,500 to spend their old deutschmarks , causing a mini economic boom that is the envy of the surrounding municipalities . better marks elsewhere overall , the eu reported on thursday that , in its estimation , the euro has been a success .
“ the successful changeover marked the beginning of a new era for europe , ” said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner .
many eu nations , particularly smaller ones , share his enthusiasm . nations with unstable , inflation-prone currencies like italy and greece were all too happy to join the european monetary project .
while the italians might complain that euro coins are too heavy , nearly one half -lrb- 49.7 percent -rrb- of europeans interviewed expressed basic satisfaction .
only 38.7 percent revealed negative feelings toward the euro one year on .
smaller nations , such as luxemburg , belgium and ireland , are the euro ’ s strongest advocates .

the survey found that only 42.2 percent of consumers calculate prices in euros .
most people still make mental calculations in their old currencies and then convert .
when it comes to big-ticket items like houses or cars , that percentage drops to 12.2 percent . one reason for this , officials in brussels say , is the dual display system used by many retailers which indicates prices in both euros and the old currency .

after the devastation of world war ii , for many the deutschmark symbolized the prosperity of the wirtschaftswunder , a strong german economy , and with it , a high level of security .
surrounded by unstable currencies like the italian lira or the french franc , the deutschmark proved itself time and again to be immune from severe fluctuations and runaway inflation . some retailers have taken advantage of this yearning for times past and have started accepting deutschmarks in their establishments again alongside the euro .
in the northern german town of kropp , almost all the businesses teamed up to run a campaign in november and december called “ the deutchmark is back . ”

“ the successful changeover marked the beginning of a new era for europe , ” said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner .
many eu nations , particularly smaller ones , share his enthusiasm . nations with unstable , inflation-prone currencies like italy and greece were all too happy to join the european monetary project .
while the italians might complain that euro coins are too heavy , nearly one half -lrb- 49.7 percent -rrb- of europeans interviewed expressed basic satisfaction .
only 38.7 percent revealed negative feelings toward the euro one year on .

they were originally introduced to increase job security and force companies to offer contractually-regulated permanent employment . the relaxation of regulations governing mini-jobs and the conditions of self-employment represent an about-face for the government , which originally pushed them through against the protests of a business community which said they would lead to less , not more , employment . temp jobs a sticking point the third provision , relating to temporary employment , was the contentious one .
its main aim is to regulate the way private short-term employment agencies work , but the way temporary workers should be treated by companies is still a major cause of disagreement . both the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats want temporary jobs to be free of contractual constraint , but the government insists that temporary workers must be paid the same as permanent workers after six weeks at most .
the government said it was not prepared to make any changes to this provision and would force it through in spite of the bundesrat ’ s opposition . getting these employment provisions into law marks the government ’ s first major reform in this legislative period , one that it had made an integral part of its election campaign . “ we wanted to send out a call to positive action , ” said the social democrats ’ employment spokesman klaus brandner .
so-called “ super-minister ” clement was less reserved in his assessment .
“ it ’ s a breakthrough , ” he said after the vote on friday .

their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money . the euro might have found a place in germans ’ wallets when cash machines started dispensing the bills on january 1st of this year , but the new money has yet to find a place in their hearts . a survey conducted by the european union commission of citizens of the 12 “ eurozone ” countries , states which have abandoned with previous national currencies for the euro , found that while half of europeans had embraced the currency , germans by far expressed the most dissatisfaction with the money that took the place of their beloved deutschmark . more than two thirds of germans -lrb- 67.8 percent -rrb- said they were dissatisfied or outright unhappy with the euro , the eu commission reported on thursday at a press conference taking stock of the euro ’ s acceptance as it approaches its one-year anniversary as a circulating currency . less than one third of germans expressed satisfaction with the new coins and bills . euro = “ teuro ” ? officials in brussels blame the lower acceptance rates in germany partly on the so-called “ teuro ” dabate that took place earlier this years .
the euro came to be popularly known by many as the “ teuro ” — a play on the german word for “ expensive ” — when some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
while analysts say actual overall price inflation was low -lrb- no more than 0.2 percent according to the eurostat statistics office -rrb- , real price hikes did occur in some food and service sectors , leading to a perception that the euro equalled less buying power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nostalgia for the old deutschmark also played a role in germans ’ less-than-adamant love affair with the new legal tender .
after the devastation of world war ii , for many the deutschmark symbolized the prosperity of the wirtschaftswunder , a strong german economy , and with it , a high level of security .
surrounded by unstable currencies like the italian lira or the french franc , the deutschmark proved itself time and again to be immune from severe fluctuations and runaway inflation . some retailers have taken advantage of this yearning for times past and have started accepting deutschmarks in their establishments again alongside the euro .
in the northern german town of kropp , almost all the businesses teamed up to run a campaign in november and december called “ the deutchmark is back . ”
people from the surrounding region have been pouring into shops in the town of 6,500 to spend their old deutschmarks , causing a mini economic boom that is the envy of the surrounding municipalities . better marks elsewhere overall , the eu reported on thursday that , in its estimation , the euro has been a success .
“ the successful changeover marked the beginning of a new era for europe , ” said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner .
many eu nations , particularly smaller ones , share his enthusiasm . nations with unstable , inflation-prone currencies like italy and greece were all too happy to join the european monetary project .
while the italians might complain that euro coins are too heavy , nearly one half -lrb- 49.7 percent -rrb- of europeans interviewed expressed basic satisfaction .
only 38.7 percent revealed negative feelings toward the euro one year on .
smaller nations , such as luxemburg , belgium and ireland , are the euro ’ s strongest advocates .
in these countries approval rates run over the 70 percent mark . psychological barriers despite the general levels of acceptance , the psychological changeover to the euro has yet to take place .
the survey found that only 42.2 percent of consumers calculate prices in euros .
most people still make mental calculations in their old currencies and then convert .
when it comes to big-ticket items like houses or cars , that percentage drops to 12.2 percent . one reason for this , officials in brussels say , is the dual display system used by many retailers which indicates prices in both euros and the old currency .

their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money . the euro might have found a place in germans ’ wallets when cash machines started dispensing the bills on january 1st of this year , but the new money has yet to find a place in their hearts . a survey conducted by the european union commission of citizens of the 12 “ eurozone ” countries , states which have abandoned with previous national currencies for the euro , found that while half of europeans had embraced the currency , germans by far expressed the most dissatisfaction with the money that took the place of their beloved deutschmark . more than two thirds of germans -lrb- 67.8 percent -rrb- said they were dissatisfied or outright unhappy with the euro , the eu commission reported on thursday at a press conference taking stock of the euro ’ s acceptance as it approaches its one-year anniversary as a circulating currency . less than one third of germans expressed satisfaction with the new coins and bills . euro = “ teuro ” ? officials in brussels blame the lower acceptance rates in germany partly on the so-called “ teuro ” dabate that took place earlier this years .
the euro came to be popularly known by many as the “ teuro ” — a play on the german word for “ expensive ” — when some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
while analysts say actual overall price inflation was low -lrb- no more than 0.2 percent according to the eurostat statistics office -rrb- , real price hikes did occur in some food and service sectors , leading to a perception that the euro equalled less buying power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nostalgia for the old deutschmark also played a role in germans ’ less-than-adamant love affair with the new legal tender .
after the devastation of world war ii , for many the deutschmark symbolized the prosperity of the wirtschaftswunder , a strong german economy , and with it , a high level of security .
surrounded by unstable currencies like the italian lira or the french franc , the deutschmark proved itself time and again to be immune from severe fluctuations and runaway inflation . some retailers have taken advantage of this yearning for times past and have started accepting deutschmarks in their establishments again alongside the euro .
in the northern german town of kropp , almost all the businesses teamed up to run a campaign in november and december called “ the deutchmark is back . ”
people from the surrounding region have been pouring into shops in the town of 6,500 to spend their old deutschmarks , causing a mini economic boom that is the envy of the surrounding municipalities . better marks elsewhere overall , the eu reported on thursday that , in its estimation , the euro has been a success .
“ the successful changeover marked the beginning of a new era for europe , ” said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner .
many eu nations , particularly smaller ones , share his enthusiasm . nations with unstable , inflation-prone currencies like italy and greece were all too happy to join the european monetary project .
while the italians might complain that euro coins are too heavy , nearly one half -lrb- 49.7 percent -rrb- of europeans interviewed expressed basic satisfaction .
only 38.7 percent revealed negative feelings toward the euro one year on .
smaller nations , such as luxemburg , belgium and ireland , are the euro ’ s strongest advocates .
in these countries approval rates run over the 70 percent mark . psychological barriers despite the general levels of acceptance , the psychological changeover to the euro has yet to take place .
the survey found that only 42.2 percent of consumers calculate prices in euros .
most people still make mental calculations in their old currencies and then convert .
when it comes to big-ticket items like houses or cars , that percentage drops to 12.2 percent . one reason for this , officials in brussels say , is the dual display system used by many retailers which indicates prices in both euros and the old currency .
this double listing , which nearly half of consumers say they like , delays the mental changeover and could ever prove counterproductive , according to the eu .

in february germany , along with holland , takes over the leadership of the international security assistance force there . on friday , an overwhelming number of german parliamentarians voted to not only keep german troops on afghan soil for twelve more months , but also to double the number of soldiers patrolling this war-torn country struggling to put down democratic roots and establish the rule of law . the german parliament , the bundestag , voted 565 to nine to lengthen the military ’ s stay in the country , where it makes up part of a 22-nation peacekeeping force brought in to stabilize the capital kabul and the surrounding region after an american bombing campaign helped drive out the fundamentalist taliban regime last year . before friday ’ s vote , foreign minister joschka fischer stressed the importance of the military ’ s continuing presence in the region .
“ there is no alternative to international engagement in afghanistan if we want to learn from september 11 , ” fischer told parliamentarians , adding that the mission there would be a long and dangerous one . germany ’ s defense minister peter struck , a member of the governing social democrats , echoed those sentiments , saying the fight against international terrorism is far from over , evidenced by thursday ’ s grenade attack near the german base in kabul .
two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .
he called for isaf to concentrate on extending the relative stability enjoyed by the kabul region to the rest of the country , which is largely still under the control of regional warlords . the government however had rejected expanding the geographic region of its mandate beyond the area immediately around kabul . more to ship out the bundestag also agreed to double the number of german soldiers serving in afghanistan , from the current 1,300 to around 2,500 .
germany is scheduled to take over leadership of isaf forces along with holland in february , and the additional soldiers will be needed for that six-month responsibility , according to defense minister struck . although the support was widespread , there were a few voices of caution .
the defense spokeswoman for the green party , winfried nachwei , denied that germany ’ s taking over the isaf reins was a way of “ making up ” for not participating in a possible iraq war . one of the dissenting votes to the extension was petra pau , member of the pacifist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .

in february germany , along with holland , takes over the leadership of the international security assistance force there . on friday , an overwhelming number of german parliamentarians voted to not only keep german troops on afghan soil for twelve more months , but also to double the number of soldiers patrolling this war-torn country struggling to put down democratic roots and establish the rule of law . the german parliament , the bundestag , voted 565 to nine to lengthen the military ’ s stay in the country , where it makes up part of a 22-nation peacekeeping force brought in to stabilize the capital kabul and the surrounding region after an american bombing campaign helped drive out the fundamentalist taliban regime last year . before friday ’ s vote , foreign minister joschka fischer stressed the importance of the military ’ s continuing presence in the region .
“ there is no alternative to international engagement in afghanistan if we want to learn from september 11 , ” fischer told parliamentarians , adding that the mission there would be a long and dangerous one . germany ’ s defense minister peter struck , a member of the governing social democrats , echoed those sentiments , saying the fight against international terrorism is far from over , evidenced by thursday ’ s grenade attack near the german base in kabul .
two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .
he called for isaf to concentrate on extending the relative stability enjoyed by the kabul region to the rest of the country , which is largely still under the control of regional warlords . the government however had rejected expanding the geographic region of its mandate beyond the area immediately around kabul . more to ship out the bundestag also agreed to double the number of german soldiers serving in afghanistan , from the current 1,300 to around 2,500 .
germany is scheduled to take over leadership of isaf forces along with holland in february , and the additional soldiers will be needed for that six-month responsibility , according to defense minister struck . although the support was widespread , there were a few voices of caution .
the defense spokeswoman for the green party , winfried nachwei , denied that germany ’ s taking over the isaf reins was a way of “ making up ” for not participating in a possible iraq war . one of the dissenting votes to the extension was petra pau , member of the pacifist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
she warned against making a decision to extend the mandate lightly , since in her opinion increasing the number of soldiers and taking on a leadership role put the operation on a new level .
the isaf ’ s success thus far , she said , has only been mediocre . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soldiers restore school in afghanistan german soldiers are helping refurbish a shattered school in a village near kabul , as rebuilding damaged infrastructure becomes an important task of the peacekeeping forces in afghanistan .

but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .

though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .
for those of us not well-versed in the intricacies of the net , irc is a new venue to explore .
and for those who value keeping their actions secret , it 's ideal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

in february germany , along with holland , takes over the leadership of the international security assistance force there . on friday , an overwhelming number of german parliamentarians voted to not only keep german troops on afghan soil for twelve more months , but also to double the number of soldiers patrolling this war-torn country struggling to put down democratic roots and establish the rule of law . the german parliament , the bundestag , voted 565 to nine to lengthen the military ’ s stay in the country , where it makes up part of a 22-nation peacekeeping force brought in to stabilize the capital kabul and the surrounding region after an american bombing campaign helped drive out the fundamentalist taliban regime last year . before friday ’ s vote , foreign minister joschka fischer stressed the importance of the military ’ s continuing presence in the region .
“ there is no alternative to international engagement in afghanistan if we want to learn from september 11 , ” fischer told parliamentarians , adding that the mission there would be a long and dangerous one . germany ’ s defense minister peter struck , a member of the governing social democrats , echoed those sentiments , saying the fight against international terrorism is far from over , evidenced by thursday ’ s grenade attack near the german base in kabul .
two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .
he called for isaf to concentrate on extending the relative stability enjoyed by the kabul region to the rest of the country , which is largely still under the control of regional warlords . the government however had rejected expanding the geographic region of its mandate beyond the area immediately around kabul . more to ship out the bundestag also agreed to double the number of german soldiers serving in afghanistan , from the current 1,300 to around 2,500 .
germany is scheduled to take over leadership of isaf forces along with holland in february , and the additional soldiers will be needed for that six-month responsibility , according to defense minister struck . although the support was widespread , there were a few voices of caution .
the defense spokeswoman for the green party , winfried nachwei , denied that germany ’ s taking over the isaf reins was a way of “ making up ” for not participating in a possible iraq war . one of the dissenting votes to the extension was petra pau , member of the pacifist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
she warned against making a decision to extend the mandate lightly , since in her opinion increasing the number of soldiers and taking on a leadership role put the operation on a new level .

after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .

in february germany , along with holland , takes over the leadership of the international security assistance force there . on friday , an overwhelming number of german parliamentarians voted to not only keep german troops on afghan soil for twelve more months , but also to double the number of soldiers patrolling this war-torn country struggling to put down democratic roots and establish the rule of law . the german parliament , the bundestag , voted 565 to nine to lengthen the military ’ s stay in the country , where it makes up part of a 22-nation peacekeeping force brought in to stabilize the capital kabul and the surrounding region after an american bombing campaign helped drive out the fundamentalist taliban regime last year . before friday ’ s vote , foreign minister joschka fischer stressed the importance of the military ’ s continuing presence in the region .
“ there is no alternative to international engagement in afghanistan if we want to learn from september 11 , ” fischer told parliamentarians , adding that the mission there would be a long and dangerous one . germany ’ s defense minister peter struck , a member of the governing social democrats , echoed those sentiments , saying the fight against international terrorism is far from over , evidenced by thursday ’ s grenade attack near the german base in kabul .
two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .
he called for isaf to concentrate on extending the relative stability enjoyed by the kabul region to the rest of the country , which is largely still under the control of regional warlords . the government however had rejected expanding the geographic region of its mandate beyond the area immediately around kabul . more to ship out the bundestag also agreed to double the number of german soldiers serving in afghanistan , from the current 1,300 to around 2,500 .
germany is scheduled to take over leadership of isaf forces along with holland in february , and the additional soldiers will be needed for that six-month responsibility , according to defense minister struck . although the support was widespread , there were a few voices of caution .
the defense spokeswoman for the green party , winfried nachwei , denied that germany ’ s taking over the isaf reins was a way of “ making up ” for not participating in a possible iraq war . one of the dissenting votes to the extension was petra pau , member of the pacifist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .

here , the government adopted the so-called " chancellor 's majority " - a method seen as a last resort to push through laws which have not been approved by the bundesrat - where it was finally voted through . the approval comes as a relief to the german government , after a turbulent week which saw various central elements of the hartz reform proposals up for implementation under severe criticism from the opposition . earlier this week , a proposal relating to the employment of temporary staff was rejected by the bundesrat , where the conservatives have a majority , and had to undergo the joint mediation committee representing both chambers of parliament before it was passed back to the bundesrat and bundestag at the end of this week . new " mini-jobs " regulation makes it worth working all three proposals are drawn from recommendations by the government-sponsored employment commission headed by former volkswagen manager peter hartz .

the minister for economy and labor , wolfgang clement , estimates this will create at least 300,000 new jobs . the plans will still cost money however , the plan does have its critics .
according to the unions the new regulations will undermine sector wage settlements , while health insurers complain that the new jobs will lead to cuts in revenues .

they were originally introduced to increase job security and force companies to offer contractually-regulated permanent employment . the relaxation of regulations governing mini-jobs and the conditions of self-employment represent an about-face for the government , which originally pushed them through against the protests of a business community which said they would lead to less , not more , employment . temp jobs a sticking point the third provision , relating to temporary employment , was the contentious one .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.12.2002 uncontrollable freedom in a parallel world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are incapable of controlling what goes on in internet chat rooms the recent cannibalism case in germany with its origins in the internet raises new questions about policing cyberspace .
but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .
for those of us not well-versed in the intricacies of the net , irc is a new venue to explore .
and for those who value keeping their actions secret , it 's ideal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .

anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .

the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .

after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .
and what ’ s left ?
nothing but ruins and a poor image abroad .

but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world -pipe- 20.12.2002 keeping the peace for another year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops in afghanistan are to continue their mission next year the german parliament has approved extending its peacekeeping mission in afghanistan for one year .
in february germany , along with holland , takes over the leadership of the international security assistance force there . on friday , an overwhelming number of german parliamentarians voted to not only keep german troops on afghan soil for twelve more months , but also to double the number of soldiers patrolling this war-torn country struggling to put down democratic roots and establish the rule of law . the german parliament , the bundestag , voted 565 to nine to lengthen the military ’ s stay in the country , where it makes up part of a 22-nation peacekeeping force brought in to stabilize the capital kabul and the surrounding region after an american bombing campaign helped drive out the fundamentalist taliban regime last year . before friday ’ s vote , foreign minister joschka fischer stressed the importance of the military ’ s continuing presence in the region .
“ there is no alternative to international engagement in afghanistan if we want to learn from september 11 , ” fischer told parliamentarians , adding that the mission there would be a long and dangerous one . germany ’ s defense minister peter struck , a member of the governing social democrats , echoed those sentiments , saying the fight against international terrorism is far from over , evidenced by thursday ’ s grenade attack near the german base in kabul .
two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .

in february germany , along with holland , takes over the leadership of the international security assistance force there . on friday , an overwhelming number of german parliamentarians voted to not only keep german troops on afghan soil for twelve more months , but also to double the number of soldiers patrolling this war-torn country struggling to put down democratic roots and establish the rule of law . the german parliament , the bundestag , voted 565 to nine to lengthen the military ’ s stay in the country , where it makes up part of a 22-nation peacekeeping force brought in to stabilize the capital kabul and the surrounding region after an american bombing campaign helped drive out the fundamentalist taliban regime last year . before friday ’ s vote , foreign minister joschka fischer stressed the importance of the military ’ s continuing presence in the region .
“ there is no alternative to international engagement in afghanistan if we want to learn from september 11 , ” fischer told parliamentarians , adding that the mission there would be a long and dangerous one . germany ’ s defense minister peter struck , a member of the governing social democrats , echoed those sentiments , saying the fight against international terrorism is far from over , evidenced by thursday ’ s grenade attack near the german base in kabul .
two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .

but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .
for those of us not well-versed in the intricacies of the net , irc is a new venue to explore .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.12.2002 still mourning the mark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they just ca n't compare nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .
their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money . the euro might have found a place in germans ’ wallets when cash machines started dispensing the bills on january 1st of this year , but the new money has yet to find a place in their hearts . a survey conducted by the european union commission of citizens of the 12 “ eurozone ” countries , states which have abandoned with previous national currencies for the euro , found that while half of europeans had embraced the currency , germans by far expressed the most dissatisfaction with the money that took the place of their beloved deutschmark . more than two thirds of germans -lrb- 67.8 percent -rrb- said they were dissatisfied or outright unhappy with the euro , the eu commission reported on thursday at a press conference taking stock of the euro ’ s acceptance as it approaches its one-year anniversary as a circulating currency . less than one third of germans expressed satisfaction with the new coins and bills . euro = “ teuro ” ? officials in brussels blame the lower acceptance rates in germany partly on the so-called “ teuro ” dabate that took place earlier this years .
the euro came to be popularly known by many as the “ teuro ” — a play on the german word for “ expensive ” — when some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
while analysts say actual overall price inflation was low -lrb- no more than 0.2 percent according to the eurostat statistics office -rrb- , real price hikes did occur in some food and service sectors , leading to a perception that the euro equalled less buying power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nostalgia for the old deutschmark also played a role in germans ’ less-than-adamant love affair with the new legal tender .
after the devastation of world war ii , for many the deutschmark symbolized the prosperity of the wirtschaftswunder , a strong german economy , and with it , a high level of security .
surrounded by unstable currencies like the italian lira or the french franc , the deutschmark proved itself time and again to be immune from severe fluctuations and runaway inflation . some retailers have taken advantage of this yearning for times past and have started accepting deutschmarks in their establishments again alongside the euro .
in the northern german town of kropp , almost all the businesses teamed up to run a campaign in november and december called “ the deutchmark is back . ”
people from the surrounding region have been pouring into shops in the town of 6,500 to spend their old deutschmarks , causing a mini economic boom that is the envy of the surrounding municipalities . better marks elsewhere overall , the eu reported on thursday that , in its estimation , the euro has been a success .
“ the successful changeover marked the beginning of a new era for europe , ” said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner .
many eu nations , particularly smaller ones , share his enthusiasm . nations with unstable , inflation-prone currencies like italy and greece were all too happy to join the european monetary project .
while the italians might complain that euro coins are too heavy , nearly one half -lrb- 49.7 percent -rrb- of europeans interviewed expressed basic satisfaction .

after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .

after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .
and what ’ s left ?
nothing but ruins and a poor image abroad . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's immigration law comes to grinding halt germany ’ s highest court has put the brakes on chancellor schröder ’ s first ever immigration law for germany that was to come into force early next year , much to the delight of the conservative opposition .

the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .

in february germany , along with holland , takes over the leadership of the international security assistance force there . on friday , an overwhelming number of german parliamentarians voted to not only keep german troops on afghan soil for twelve more months , but also to double the number of soldiers patrolling this war-torn country struggling to put down democratic roots and establish the rule of law . the german parliament , the bundestag , voted 565 to nine to lengthen the military ’ s stay in the country , where it makes up part of a 22-nation peacekeeping force brought in to stabilize the capital kabul and the surrounding region after an american bombing campaign helped drive out the fundamentalist taliban regime last year . before friday ’ s vote , foreign minister joschka fischer stressed the importance of the military ’ s continuing presence in the region .
“ there is no alternative to international engagement in afghanistan if we want to learn from september 11 , ” fischer told parliamentarians , adding that the mission there would be a long and dangerous one . germany ’ s defense minister peter struck , a member of the governing social democrats , echoed those sentiments , saying the fight against international terrorism is far from over , evidenced by thursday ’ s grenade attack near the german base in kabul .
two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .
he called for isaf to concentrate on extending the relative stability enjoyed by the kabul region to the rest of the country , which is largely still under the control of regional warlords . the government however had rejected expanding the geographic region of its mandate beyond the area immediately around kabul . more to ship out the bundestag also agreed to double the number of german soldiers serving in afghanistan , from the current 1,300 to around 2,500 .
germany is scheduled to take over leadership of isaf forces along with holland in february , and the additional soldiers will be needed for that six-month responsibility , according to defense minister struck . although the support was widespread , there were a few voices of caution .
the defense spokeswoman for the green party , winfried nachwei , denied that germany ’ s taking over the isaf reins was a way of “ making up ” for not participating in a possible iraq war . one of the dissenting votes to the extension was petra pau , member of the pacifist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
she warned against making a decision to extend the mandate lightly , since in her opinion increasing the number of soldiers and taking on a leadership role put the operation on a new level .

their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money . the euro might have found a place in germans ’ wallets when cash machines started dispensing the bills on january 1st of this year , but the new money has yet to find a place in their hearts . a survey conducted by the european union commission of citizens of the 12 “ eurozone ” countries , states which have abandoned with previous national currencies for the euro , found that while half of europeans had embraced the currency , germans by far expressed the most dissatisfaction with the money that took the place of their beloved deutschmark . more than two thirds of germans -lrb- 67.8 percent -rrb- said they were dissatisfied or outright unhappy with the euro , the eu commission reported on thursday at a press conference taking stock of the euro ’ s acceptance as it approaches its one-year anniversary as a circulating currency . less than one third of germans expressed satisfaction with the new coins and bills . euro = “ teuro ” ? officials in brussels blame the lower acceptance rates in germany partly on the so-called “ teuro ” dabate that took place earlier this years .
the euro came to be popularly known by many as the “ teuro ” — a play on the german word for “ expensive ” — when some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
while analysts say actual overall price inflation was low -lrb- no more than 0.2 percent according to the eurostat statistics office -rrb- , real price hikes did occur in some food and service sectors , leading to a perception that the euro equalled less buying power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nostalgia for the old deutschmark also played a role in germans ’ less-than-adamant love affair with the new legal tender .
after the devastation of world war ii , for many the deutschmark symbolized the prosperity of the wirtschaftswunder , a strong german economy , and with it , a high level of security .
surrounded by unstable currencies like the italian lira or the french franc , the deutschmark proved itself time and again to be immune from severe fluctuations and runaway inflation . some retailers have taken advantage of this yearning for times past and have started accepting deutschmarks in their establishments again alongside the euro .
in the northern german town of kropp , almost all the businesses teamed up to run a campaign in november and december called “ the deutchmark is back . ”
people from the surrounding region have been pouring into shops in the town of 6,500 to spend their old deutschmarks , causing a mini economic boom that is the envy of the surrounding municipalities . better marks elsewhere overall , the eu reported on thursday that , in its estimation , the euro has been a success .
“ the successful changeover marked the beginning of a new era for europe , ” said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner .
many eu nations , particularly smaller ones , share his enthusiasm . nations with unstable , inflation-prone currencies like italy and greece were all too happy to join the european monetary project .
while the italians might complain that euro coins are too heavy , nearly one half -lrb- 49.7 percent -rrb- of europeans interviewed expressed basic satisfaction .
only 38.7 percent revealed negative feelings toward the euro one year on .
smaller nations , such as luxemburg , belgium and ireland , are the euro ’ s strongest advocates .

the survey found that only 42.2 percent of consumers calculate prices in euros .
most people still make mental calculations in their old currencies and then convert .
when it comes to big-ticket items like houses or cars , that percentage drops to 12.2 percent . one reason for this , officials in brussels say , is the dual display system used by many retailers which indicates prices in both euros and the old currency .
this double listing , which nearly half of consumers say they like , delays the mental changeover and could ever prove counterproductive , according to the eu .

after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .

after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .

in february germany , along with holland , takes over the leadership of the international security assistance force there . on friday , an overwhelming number of german parliamentarians voted to not only keep german troops on afghan soil for twelve more months , but also to double the number of soldiers patrolling this war-torn country struggling to put down democratic roots and establish the rule of law . the german parliament , the bundestag , voted 565 to nine to lengthen the military ’ s stay in the country , where it makes up part of a 22-nation peacekeeping force brought in to stabilize the capital kabul and the surrounding region after an american bombing campaign helped drive out the fundamentalist taliban regime last year . before friday ’ s vote , foreign minister joschka fischer stressed the importance of the military ’ s continuing presence in the region .
“ there is no alternative to international engagement in afghanistan if we want to learn from september 11 , ” fischer told parliamentarians , adding that the mission there would be a long and dangerous one . germany ’ s defense minister peter struck , a member of the governing social democrats , echoed those sentiments , saying the fight against international terrorism is far from over , evidenced by thursday ’ s grenade attack near the german base in kabul .
two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .
he called for isaf to concentrate on extending the relative stability enjoyed by the kabul region to the rest of the country , which is largely still under the control of regional warlords . the government however had rejected expanding the geographic region of its mandate beyond the area immediately around kabul . more to ship out the bundestag also agreed to double the number of german soldiers serving in afghanistan , from the current 1,300 to around 2,500 .
germany is scheduled to take over leadership of isaf forces along with holland in february , and the additional soldiers will be needed for that six-month responsibility , according to defense minister struck . although the support was widespread , there were a few voices of caution .
the defense spokeswoman for the green party , winfried nachwei , denied that germany ’ s taking over the isaf reins was a way of “ making up ” for not participating in a possible iraq war . one of the dissenting votes to the extension was petra pau , member of the pacifist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.12.2002 three reforms forward , two reforms back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister minister wolfgang clement called the reforms " a breakthough " the first of the german hartz commission 's labor market reforms were approved by parliament on friday .
two of them see the government backtracking on previous labor policies a long way . the first three provisions of the german government ’ s far-reaching labor market reforms were approved by the german parliament , the bundestag on friday . after the bundesrat , the country ’ s upper house , rejected one of the proposals on friday , it was returned to the bundestag .
here , the government adopted the so-called " chancellor 's majority " - a method seen as a last resort to push through laws which have not been approved by the bundesrat - where it was finally voted through . the approval comes as a relief to the german government , after a turbulent week which saw various central elements of the hartz reform proposals up for implementation under severe criticism from the opposition . earlier this week , a proposal relating to the employment of temporary staff was rejected by the bundesrat , where the conservatives have a majority , and had to undergo the joint mediation committee representing both chambers of parliament before it was passed back to the bundesrat and bundestag at the end of this week . new " mini-jobs " regulation makes it worth working all three proposals are drawn from recommendations by the government-sponsored employment commission headed by former volkswagen manager peter hartz .
the one that has generated most enthusiasm is one which should make low-paid part-time jobs - so-called " mini-jobs " - more attractive .
it will exempt people earning less than 400 euros a month from making social welfare insurance contributions – until now , the cut-off point has been 325 euros . in addition , reduced contributions will be introduced for jobs paying less than 800 euros a month .
employers will also pay reduced contributions up to that limit .
the minister for economy and labor , wolfgang clement , estimates this will create at least 300,000 new jobs . the plans will still cost money however , the plan does have its critics .
according to the unions the new regulations will undermine sector wage settlements , while health insurers complain that the new jobs will lead to cuts in revenues .
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung this week quoted unnamed sources within the governing coalition as saying the mini-jobs could cost as much as a billion marks in lost tax revenues and contributions . the second provision is the withdrawal of the regulations defining the conditions under which a person can be counted as self-employed .
they were originally introduced to increase job security and force companies to offer contractually-regulated permanent employment . the relaxation of regulations governing mini-jobs and the conditions of self-employment represent an about-face for the government , which originally pushed them through against the protests of a business community which said they would lead to less , not more , employment . temp jobs a sticking point the third provision , relating to temporary employment , was the contentious one .
its main aim is to regulate the way private short-term employment agencies work , but the way temporary workers should be treated by companies is still a major cause of disagreement . both the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats want temporary jobs to be free of contractual constraint , but the government insists that temporary workers must be paid the same as permanent workers after six weeks at most .
the government said it was not prepared to make any changes to this provision and would force it through in spite of the bundesrat ’ s opposition . getting these employment provisions into law marks the government ’ s first major reform in this legislative period , one that it had made an integral part of its election campaign . “ we wanted to send out a call to positive action , ” said the social democrats ’ employment spokesman klaus brandner .
so-called “ super-minister ” clement was less reserved in his assessment .
“ it ’ s a breakthrough , ” he said after the vote on friday .
“ it ’ s a first big step towards employment , and more will follow . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accord reached on aspect of labor reform despite a compromise in the conciliation committee on changes in the low-pay job sector , several central aspects of the the government 's labor reforms remain unresolved .

under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .

in february germany , along with holland , takes over the leadership of the international security assistance force there . on friday , an overwhelming number of german parliamentarians voted to not only keep german troops on afghan soil for twelve more months , but also to double the number of soldiers patrolling this war-torn country struggling to put down democratic roots and establish the rule of law . the german parliament , the bundestag , voted 565 to nine to lengthen the military ’ s stay in the country , where it makes up part of a 22-nation peacekeeping force brought in to stabilize the capital kabul and the surrounding region after an american bombing campaign helped drive out the fundamentalist taliban regime last year . before friday ’ s vote , foreign minister joschka fischer stressed the importance of the military ’ s continuing presence in the region .
“ there is no alternative to international engagement in afghanistan if we want to learn from september 11 , ” fischer told parliamentarians , adding that the mission there would be a long and dangerous one . germany ’ s defense minister peter struck , a member of the governing social democrats , echoed those sentiments , saying the fight against international terrorism is far from over , evidenced by thursday ’ s grenade attack near the german base in kabul .
two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .
he called for isaf to concentrate on extending the relative stability enjoyed by the kabul region to the rest of the country , which is largely still under the control of regional warlords . the government however had rejected expanding the geographic region of its mandate beyond the area immediately around kabul . more to ship out the bundestag also agreed to double the number of german soldiers serving in afghanistan , from the current 1,300 to around 2,500 .
germany is scheduled to take over leadership of isaf forces along with holland in february , and the additional soldiers will be needed for that six-month responsibility , according to defense minister struck . although the support was widespread , there were a few voices of caution .
the defense spokeswoman for the green party , winfried nachwei , denied that germany ’ s taking over the isaf reins was a way of “ making up ” for not participating in a possible iraq war . one of the dissenting votes to the extension was petra pau , member of the pacifist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.12.2002 three reforms forward , two reforms back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics and labor minister minister wolfgang clement called the reforms " a breakthough " the first of the german hartz commission 's labor market reforms were approved by parliament on friday .
two of them see the government backtracking on previous labor policies a long way . the first three provisions of the german government ’ s far-reaching labor market reforms were approved by the german parliament , the bundestag on friday . after the bundesrat , the country ’ s upper house , rejected one of the proposals on friday , it was returned to the bundestag .
here , the government adopted the so-called " chancellor 's majority " - a method seen as a last resort to push through laws which have not been approved by the bundesrat - where it was finally voted through . the approval comes as a relief to the german government , after a turbulent week which saw various central elements of the hartz reform proposals up for implementation under severe criticism from the opposition . earlier this week , a proposal relating to the employment of temporary staff was rejected by the bundesrat , where the conservatives have a majority , and had to undergo the joint mediation committee representing both chambers of parliament before it was passed back to the bundesrat and bundestag at the end of this week . new " mini-jobs " regulation makes it worth working all three proposals are drawn from recommendations by the government-sponsored employment commission headed by former volkswagen manager peter hartz .
the one that has generated most enthusiasm is one which should make low-paid part-time jobs - so-called " mini-jobs " - more attractive .
it will exempt people earning less than 400 euros a month from making social welfare insurance contributions – until now , the cut-off point has been 325 euros . in addition , reduced contributions will be introduced for jobs paying less than 800 euros a month .
employers will also pay reduced contributions up to that limit .
the minister for economy and labor , wolfgang clement , estimates this will create at least 300,000 new jobs . the plans will still cost money however , the plan does have its critics .
according to the unions the new regulations will undermine sector wage settlements , while health insurers complain that the new jobs will lead to cuts in revenues .
munich ’ s süddeutsche zeitung this week quoted unnamed sources within the governing coalition as saying the mini-jobs could cost as much as a billion marks in lost tax revenues and contributions . the second provision is the withdrawal of the regulations defining the conditions under which a person can be counted as self-employed .
they were originally introduced to increase job security and force companies to offer contractually-regulated permanent employment . the relaxation of regulations governing mini-jobs and the conditions of self-employment represent an about-face for the government , which originally pushed them through against the protests of a business community which said they would lead to less , not more , employment . temp jobs a sticking point the third provision , relating to temporary employment , was the contentious one .
its main aim is to regulate the way private short-term employment agencies work , but the way temporary workers should be treated by companies is still a major cause of disagreement . both the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats want temporary jobs to be free of contractual constraint , but the government insists that temporary workers must be paid the same as permanent workers after six weeks at most .
the government said it was not prepared to make any changes to this provision and would force it through in spite of the bundesrat ’ s opposition . getting these employment provisions into law marks the government ’ s first major reform in this legislative period , one that it had made an integral part of its election campaign . “ we wanted to send out a call to positive action , ” said the social democrats ’ employment spokesman klaus brandner .
so-called “ super-minister ” clement was less reserved in his assessment .
“ it ’ s a breakthrough , ” he said after the vote on friday .
“ it ’ s a first big step towards employment , and more will follow . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de accord reached on aspect of labor reform despite a compromise in the conciliation committee on changes in the low-pay job sector , several central aspects of the the government 's labor reforms remain unresolved .
minister denies diluting labor reforms german labor minister wolfgang clement dismissed criticism that the government is not properly implementing the reforms proposed by the hartz commission .

armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .

months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "

on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .

the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .

internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.12.2002 german parties squabble over immigration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bit too late to be bickering over immigration ?
after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .

but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .
for those of us not well-versed in the intricacies of the net , irc is a new venue to explore .

in february germany , along with holland , takes over the leadership of the international security assistance force there . on friday , an overwhelming number of german parliamentarians voted to not only keep german troops on afghan soil for twelve more months , but also to double the number of soldiers patrolling this war-torn country struggling to put down democratic roots and establish the rule of law . the german parliament , the bundestag , voted 565 to nine to lengthen the military ’ s stay in the country , where it makes up part of a 22-nation peacekeeping force brought in to stabilize the capital kabul and the surrounding region after an american bombing campaign helped drive out the fundamentalist taliban regime last year . before friday ’ s vote , foreign minister joschka fischer stressed the importance of the military ’ s continuing presence in the region .
“ there is no alternative to international engagement in afghanistan if we want to learn from september 11 , ” fischer told parliamentarians , adding that the mission there would be a long and dangerous one . germany ’ s defense minister peter struck , a member of the governing social democrats , echoed those sentiments , saying the fight against international terrorism is far from over , evidenced by thursday ’ s grenade attack near the german base in kabul .
two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .
he called for isaf to concentrate on extending the relative stability enjoyed by the kabul region to the rest of the country , which is largely still under the control of regional warlords . the government however had rejected expanding the geographic region of its mandate beyond the area immediately around kabul . more to ship out the bundestag also agreed to double the number of german soldiers serving in afghanistan , from the current 1,300 to around 2,500 .
germany is scheduled to take over leadership of isaf forces along with holland in february , and the additional soldiers will be needed for that six-month responsibility , according to defense minister struck . although the support was widespread , there were a few voices of caution .
the defense spokeswoman for the green party , winfried nachwei , denied that germany ’ s taking over the isaf reins was a way of “ making up ” for not participating in a possible iraq war . one of the dissenting votes to the extension was petra pau , member of the pacifist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
she warned against making a decision to extend the mandate lightly , since in her opinion increasing the number of soldiers and taking on a leadership role put the operation on a new level .
the isaf ’ s success thus far , she said , has only been mediocre . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soldiers restore school in afghanistan german soldiers are helping refurbish a shattered school in a village near kabul , as rebuilding damaged infrastructure becomes an important task of the peacekeeping forces in afghanistan .

after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .

our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .
and what ’ s left ?
nothing but ruins and a poor image abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.12.2002 uncontrollable freedom in a parallel world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are incapable of controlling what goes on in internet chat rooms the recent cannibalism case in germany with its origins in the internet raises new questions about policing cyberspace .
but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .
for those of us not well-versed in the intricacies of the net , irc is a new venue to explore .
and for those who value keeping their actions secret , it 's ideal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

in february germany , along with holland , takes over the leadership of the international security assistance force there . on friday , an overwhelming number of german parliamentarians voted to not only keep german troops on afghan soil for twelve more months , but also to double the number of soldiers patrolling this war-torn country struggling to put down democratic roots and establish the rule of law . the german parliament , the bundestag , voted 565 to nine to lengthen the military ’ s stay in the country , where it makes up part of a 22-nation peacekeeping force brought in to stabilize the capital kabul and the surrounding region after an american bombing campaign helped drive out the fundamentalist taliban regime last year . before friday ’ s vote , foreign minister joschka fischer stressed the importance of the military ’ s continuing presence in the region .
“ there is no alternative to international engagement in afghanistan if we want to learn from september 11 , ” fischer told parliamentarians , adding that the mission there would be a long and dangerous one . germany ’ s defense minister peter struck , a member of the governing social democrats , echoed those sentiments , saying the fight against international terrorism is far from over , evidenced by thursday ’ s grenade attack near the german base in kabul .
two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .
he called for isaf to concentrate on extending the relative stability enjoyed by the kabul region to the rest of the country , which is largely still under the control of regional warlords . the government however had rejected expanding the geographic region of its mandate beyond the area immediately around kabul . more to ship out the bundestag also agreed to double the number of german soldiers serving in afghanistan , from the current 1,300 to around 2,500 .
germany is scheduled to take over leadership of isaf forces along with holland in february , and the additional soldiers will be needed for that six-month responsibility , according to defense minister struck . although the support was widespread , there were a few voices of caution .
the defense spokeswoman for the green party , winfried nachwei , denied that germany ’ s taking over the isaf reins was a way of “ making up ” for not participating in a possible iraq war . one of the dissenting votes to the extension was petra pau , member of the pacifist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .

two afghans died and two french civilians were injured when a man threw two grenades outside one of the main international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- bases . politically popular approval to extend the german mandate crossed party lines , with both the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- voting in favor . the cdu ’ s foreign affairs spokesman friedbert pflüger said removing the peacekeeping troops now would be a belated victory for the taliban .
he called for isaf to concentrate on extending the relative stability enjoyed by the kabul region to the rest of the country , which is largely still under the control of regional warlords . the government however had rejected expanding the geographic region of its mandate beyond the area immediately around kabul . more to ship out the bundestag also agreed to double the number of german soldiers serving in afghanistan , from the current 1,300 to around 2,500 .
germany is scheduled to take over leadership of isaf forces along with holland in february , and the additional soldiers will be needed for that six-month responsibility , according to defense minister struck . although the support was widespread , there were a few voices of caution .
the defense spokeswoman for the green party , winfried nachwei , denied that germany ’ s taking over the isaf reins was a way of “ making up ” for not participating in a possible iraq war . one of the dissenting votes to the extension was petra pau , member of the pacifist party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- .
she warned against making a decision to extend the mandate lightly , since in her opinion increasing the number of soldiers and taking on a leadership role put the operation on a new level .

after germany ’ s first attempt to regulate immigration was blocked in court , political haggling threatens to further delay the process .
the conservatives are now proposing their own law for the integration of foreigners . german chancellor schröder ’ s government is in for some tough talks with the opposition as it tries to salvage the country ’ s first ever immigration legislation that was struck down by the constitutional court earlier this week .
the law that was aimed at simplifying regulations governing residency permits and making it easier for foreigners to work and live in germany was due to come into force on jan 1 , 2003 .
but it was declared unconstitutional by the highest court in karlsruhe on wednesday this week , after opposition conservatives complained that the bill had been illegally passed in the bundesrat or upper house of parliament in march this year .
conservative opposition not happy with present law the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who signaled their readiness to talk with the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens after the constitutional court ’ s decision , are now using their increased clout in the bundesrat to force schröder ’ s government to take on board several far-reaching changes to the immigration legislation .
some members of the cdu , have even gone as far as to say that the government should change the existing blueprint for an immigration law that is due to be reintroduced in both houses of parliament in jan 2003 .
the present law includes among other things provisions for a points system to lure skilled and qualified workers from abroad and a range of measures from language to citizenship courses to help their integration into german society .
four conditions for immigrations , says opposition but the conservatives say the law doesn ’ t go far enough to help integration of foreigners already living in germany and are now proposing their own integration law .
reinhold bocklet of the opposition christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- and the bavarian minister for the bundesrat said that the christian democratic parties would stipulate " four clear conditions " for passing a new immigration law .
these include setting a strict limit on the number of immigrants , especially on those coming from non-eu countries , limitations on access to the social security system by immigrants and political asylum seekers , ensuring that immigrants are well-qualified and needed by the german economy and measures to ease the integration of foreigners already living in germany .
the conservative opposition parties have also made it clear that they would also apply for the 91 changes to the immigration law that they introduced early this year , if the government insisted on pushing through with the immigration law in its present form .
the deputy parliamentary leader of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach reckons with hard negotiations with the government .
in an interview with the financial times deutschland he said , " the greens will exert a lot of pressure on the spd .
that ’ s why interior minister , otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- will not be ready for substantial concessions . "
in a separate interview , bosbach demanded a separate integration law .
" it ’ s entirely possible , " he said .
immigration emotional issue for the greens the conservatives ‘ hard talk has set alarm bells ringing in the ruling coalition , who now fear that they may be forced to change the bill beyond recognition , given the majority that the conservatives enjoy in the bundesrat .
parliamentary leader of the pacifist greens , volker beck told the berliner zeitung , " we want to in principle stick to the humanitarian goals of the law .
our soul hinges on that and we won ’ t sell our soul during the negotiations . "
the federal government commissioner for foreigners and integration , marieluise beck of the green party welcomed the conservatives ‘ suggestion that foreigners already living in germany should also have the right to participate in proposed language courses .
till now provisions in the immigration law foresaw that only for new immigrants .
but the green politician described as " absurd " another opposition proposal that the present freeze on luring foreign workers should be maintained .
beck said that the proposal contradicts the original motive for the immigration law in the first place .
" we won ’ t allow the intended purpose of the law to be reversed , " she said .
making immigration an electoral issue beck has also warned the opposition of exploiting the immigration law for electoral gains in upcoming regional polls in the states of hessen and lower saxony in february .
" there ’ s a danger that other battles will be defeated at the cost of foreigner issues , " she said .
it ’ s a fear echoed by memet kilic , chairman of the federal advisory council on foreigners ‘ affairs .
in an interview with the f.a.z. weekly , he said , " important legislation has thus fallen victim to party-political warfare , with this new law , germany wanted to prove that it is an open , modern immigration country .
and what ’ s left ?
nothing but ruins and a poor image abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 20.12.2002 uncontrollable freedom in a parallel world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are incapable of controlling what goes on in internet chat rooms the recent cannibalism case in germany with its origins in the internet raises new questions about policing cyberspace .
but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .
for those of us not well-versed in the intricacies of the net , irc is a new venue to explore .
and for those who value keeping their actions secret , it 's ideal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money . the euro might have found a place in germans ’ wallets when cash machines started dispensing the bills on january 1st of this year , but the new money has yet to find a place in their hearts . a survey conducted by the european union commission of citizens of the 12 “ eurozone ” countries , states which have abandoned with previous national currencies for the euro , found that while half of europeans had embraced the currency , germans by far expressed the most dissatisfaction with the money that took the place of their beloved deutschmark . more than two thirds of germans -lrb- 67.8 percent -rrb- said they were dissatisfied or outright unhappy with the euro , the eu commission reported on thursday at a press conference taking stock of the euro ’ s acceptance as it approaches its one-year anniversary as a circulating currency . less than one third of germans expressed satisfaction with the new coins and bills . euro = “ teuro ” ? officials in brussels blame the lower acceptance rates in germany partly on the so-called “ teuro ” dabate that took place earlier this years .
the euro came to be popularly known by many as the “ teuro ” — a play on the german word for “ expensive ” — when some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
while analysts say actual overall price inflation was low -lrb- no more than 0.2 percent according to the eurostat statistics office -rrb- , real price hikes did occur in some food and service sectors , leading to a perception that the euro equalled less buying power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nostalgia for the old deutschmark also played a role in germans ’ less-than-adamant love affair with the new legal tender .
after the devastation of world war ii , for many the deutschmark symbolized the prosperity of the wirtschaftswunder , a strong german economy , and with it , a high level of security .
surrounded by unstable currencies like the italian lira or the french franc , the deutschmark proved itself time and again to be immune from severe fluctuations and runaway inflation . some retailers have taken advantage of this yearning for times past and have started accepting deutschmarks in their establishments again alongside the euro .
in the northern german town of kropp , almost all the businesses teamed up to run a campaign in november and december called “ the deutchmark is back . ”
people from the surrounding region have been pouring into shops in the town of 6,500 to spend their old deutschmarks , causing a mini economic boom that is the envy of the surrounding municipalities . better marks elsewhere overall , the eu reported on thursday that , in its estimation , the euro has been a success .
“ the successful changeover marked the beginning of a new era for europe , ” said pedro solbes , the eu ’ s economic and monetary affairs commissioner .
many eu nations , particularly smaller ones , share his enthusiasm . nations with unstable , inflation-prone currencies like italy and greece were all too happy to join the european monetary project .
while the italians might complain that euro coins are too heavy , nearly one half -lrb- 49.7 percent -rrb- of europeans interviewed expressed basic satisfaction .
only 38.7 percent revealed negative feelings toward the euro one year on .
smaller nations , such as luxemburg , belgium and ireland , are the euro ’ s strongest advocates .
in these countries approval rates run over the 70 percent mark . psychological barriers despite the general levels of acceptance , the psychological changeover to the euro has yet to take place .
the survey found that only 42.2 percent of consumers calculate prices in euros .
most people still make mental calculations in their old currencies and then convert .
when it comes to big-ticket items like houses or cars , that percentage drops to 12.2 percent . one reason for this , officials in brussels say , is the dual display system used by many retailers which indicates prices in both euros and the old currency .
this double listing , which nearly half of consumers say they like , delays the mental changeover and could ever prove counterproductive , according to the eu .

they were originally introduced to increase job security and force companies to offer contractually-regulated permanent employment . the relaxation of regulations governing mini-jobs and the conditions of self-employment represent an about-face for the government , which originally pushed them through against the protests of a business community which said they would lead to less , not more , employment . temp jobs a sticking point the third provision , relating to temporary employment , was the contentious one .
its main aim is to regulate the way private short-term employment agencies work , but the way temporary workers should be treated by companies is still a major cause of disagreement . both the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats want temporary jobs to be free of contractual constraint , but the government insists that temporary workers must be paid the same as permanent workers after six weeks at most .
the government said it was not prepared to make any changes to this provision and would force it through in spite of the bundesrat ’ s opposition . getting these employment provisions into law marks the government ’ s first major reform in this legislative period , one that it had made an integral part of its election campaign . “ we wanted to send out a call to positive action , ” said the social democrats ’ employment spokesman klaus brandner .

but novel ways of avoiding detection in the internet has made the task tougher for cops . the internet plays a bit part in this story , but an important one .
last week germans received the news that a man killed and ate another man with the victim 's consent .
police controls may have been able to stop the gruesome events , but the authorities stepped in far too late .
armin m. and bernd b. met through an internet chat room for bizarre sex .
under the pseudonym “ franky , ” armin used the site to find a cohort : “ hi , are you between 18 and 30 years old and have a normal build , and would you like to be slaughtered ?
then come to me and i ’ ll do it . ”
bernd responded .
in march 2001 he disappeared after taking a day off work as a computer chip developer in berlin to attend to " personal matters . "
he apparently went to meet his chat partner , armin .
last week police arrested armin and charged him with murder .
he subsequently confessed to castrating , killing and eating bernd .
the police reportedly recovered a video , a human skeleton and frozen human flesh from armin ’ s house in the town of rotenburg .
the video allegedly shows not only that bernd agreed to armin cutting off his penis - which the two men ate - and killing him , but also the acts themselves .
limited surveillance were it not for the internet , the two men may never have met .
months after bernd ’ s disappearance , the police started to investigate armin m. the german federal office of criminal investigation -lrb- bka -rrb- received a tip from an internet user who came across one of armin 's ads looking for men to " slaughter . "
though that chance lead may have led police to armin 's covert activities , in reality police agencies can do little to prevent criminal activities in the internet .
in late 1998 the bka set up a department devoted to fighting crimes - mainly child pornography - in the net .
now 19 officers patrol cyberspace night and day .
when they come across signs of criminal activity , they pass them on to local authorities , who open investigations .
but , as birgit heib , a spokesperson for the bka admits , the state is unable to hinder online dealings like the advertisement that bernd responded to .
freedom of expression - enshrined in the german constitution - prevents police authorities from banning web sites or chat rooms .
easy , anonymous access on the world wide web , sites like the one where armin m. and bernd b. met are easy to find for anyone who cares to look .
and , while software exists to control chat rooms and sites on the web , there are other ways to go undetected , explains burkhard schröder , a journalist and internet expert .
on a sort of parallel plane outside of the web , internet relay chat -lrb- irc -rrb- allows users to communicate invisibly and in total anonymity .
just like the web , which is actually a protocol called http , irc is a protocol .
it allows an unlimited number of people to chat with each other in real time .
the system was created in finland in 1988 by jarkko oikarinen , a computer administer at a finnish university .
oikarinen aimed to develop a system to improve the on-campus bulletin board .
irc first gained popularity during the 1991 gulf war , when events were transmitted live on the system .
during the 1991 russian coup and the 1994 californian earthquake , eyewitnesses reported on events as they unfolded .
internet relay chat is made up of servers that are linked to each other in a tree-like fashion .
a program -lrb- called a " client " -rrb- connects users to servers or networks where they can chat publicly or privately with an unlimited number of people on different channels .
the clients are available online for free or for a nominal fee .
the different channels , often discussion topics , are run by channel operators , who choose who joins , who must leave and who may speak .
anyone can be a channel operator .
channels disappear when the last person leaves .
one of the biggest nets and the first one , efnet , has 105,000 users , 370 operators , 41,000 channels and 50 servers .
irc continues to be developed by volunteers all over the world .
irc users communicate with others by sending text messages through the system .
even when they are public , irc channels are difficult to monitor , and the users can not always be tracked .
they use nicknames and are not required to reveal personal information at anytime .
even internet service providers are unable to detect irc activity .
like the world wide web , irc is accessible throughout the world .
the system is administered by irc operators -lrb- called ircops -rrb- , who neither take part in exchanges nor police them .
in fact , there is no way to police irc so far .
the only chance authorities have to prevent crimes planned through irc is to go undercover .
dangers of irc while clandestine activities can not be detected , irc harbors other dangers .
users have to be especially careful to avoid viruses and hackers .
the four biggest irc nets are regularly subjected to attacks that hinder or block use , so that increasingly users are getting access through smaller nets .
the irc help archive warns newcomers to learn as much as they can about the system to avoid risks before actually joining a chat .
malicious users can hack into other people 's computers or flood them with text or with certain requests that will make the server automatically disconnect them .
irc faq sites also advise users not to reveal they are female because they are likely to be subjected to harassment .
for those of us not well-versed in the intricacies of the net , irc is a new venue to explore .
and for those who value keeping their actions secret , it 's ideal . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

it has always held that , in the end , it has the right to decide whether iraq has complied with the terms of the resolution , whatever the council itself might say .
now it can play this card when it wants .
iraqi material unaccounted for nearly four tons of vx nerve agents growth media for 20,000 litres of biological warfare agents 15,000 shells for use in biological warfare 6,000 chemical warfare bombs nuclear information click here for full analysis for the moment , it is choosing not to do so - perhaps because its position has weaknesses .
for a start , the british allies have not yet come alongside .
the british ambassador to the un , sir jeremy greenstock , said after the security council had met the chief weapons inspectors that a false declaration made by iraq about its weapons was not enough for it to be found in material breach .
iraq had , he said , to show a lack of co-operation with the inspectors as well - as laid down by paragraph four of the resolution , which says that " false statements or omissions ... and failure at any time to ... co-operate ... shall constitute a further material breach . "
" we will be faithful to the text of 1441 , " said the british diplomat .
the united states , however , appears to be going beyond the terms of the resolution by asserting a material breach on the basis of an alleged false declaration alone .
the french and russians argued in negotiations leading up to the resolution that both a false statement and a failure to co-operate would be needed .
that is why they insisted on the use of " and " in paragraph four and not " or " .
washington seems to be ignoring this distinction .
britain is not .
absence of evidence another factor holding up us action is that the assessment about iraqi omissions is based on the absence of evidence .
it is argued that iraq has not explained what happened to material it was believed to have had in 1998 when the inspectors left .
saying that someone has not proved they destroyed something is not as good as proving that they have it .
it would not convince large sections of world , or even american opinion .
take one piece of " missing " material as an example - 1.5 tons of vx nerve agent .
the british and us governments say that this has not been accounted for .
for now , the inspections go on but according to a report in january 1999 by the previous un weapons inspection group unscom , the iraqis said that they had destroyed the vx by dumping it and un scientists found traces at the site .
iraq will now be asked to produce some evidence to support its claim - the technicians who dumped it , the dates , the documents .
the us state department has also revealed the name of the african country from which iraq has allegedly tried to obtain uranium - niger .
this was another test case for iraq to explain its intentions , yet it has not it seems done so .
if evidence is withheld in this and other such cases , britain might then adopt the same position as the united states .
but that moment has not yet arrived .
the more immediate expectation is that the inspections regime will be toughened in order to test all this .
it is likely to be extended from sites and buildings to people .
iraqi scientists are the ones who really know what might have been hidden .
taking up position another factor holding up american action is the simple one that not enough us troops are in position yet to wage a war .
the us secretary of state says that , if there is a war , it will be as " swift as possible " .
that presupposes the use of overwhelming force , which was mr powell 's trademark in the gulf war .
that force is not yet available .
so it is convenient for washington to allow more time and to give baghdad another chance , even though the american un ambassador john negroponte - a determined character who showed his steel in the reagan administration - said that it had already " spurned its last opportunity to comply " .
if saddam hussein explains all - if he can - even at this stage he could just get off the hook .
but his window of opportunity is getting narrower and narrower .

secretary of state colin powell said on thursday that omissions in the document meant that baghdad was " well on its way to losing this last chance " to avoid military action .
the pattern of ... gaps in iraq 's declaration is not the result of accidents or editing oversights or technical mistakes colin powell mr powell stressed that the us still accepted that weapons inspectors should continue their work in iraq , but warned that the burden was on baghdad to prove that it did not have weapons of mass destruction .
he was speaking soon after the chief weapons inspector , hans blix , told the un security council that the declaration showed that baghdad had missed an opportunity to fill in gaps in the evidence .
bbc washington correspondent justin webb says there is a sense of satisfaction in the white house at the outcome of the security council meeting .
the us is optimistic that it is winning its argument at the un that iraq can not be trusted to disarm itself , our correspondent says .
resolution 1441 , which led to the return of weapons inspectors to iraq , threatens baghdad with " serious consequences " if it fails to comply with un disarmament demands .
' uranium search ' the white house is now expected to provide more intelligence to the weapons inspectors and to push for interviews to be conducted with iraqi scientists .
omissions reported by washington and un inspectors include attempts to procure uranium and aluminium tubes needed to enrich it .
iraqi material unaccounted for nearly four tons of vx nerve agents growth media for 20,000 litres of biological warfare agents 15,000 shells for use in biological warfare 6,000 chemical warfare bombs nuclear information click here for full analysis a fact sheet issued by the us state department accused baghdad of seeking to procure uranium from niger for the creation of nuclear weapons , and omitting this from the arms declaration .
it is the first time the us has officially identified a country it believes was contacted by iraq in order to find uranium .
the international atomic energy agency , which supplies some of the un weapons inspectors working in iraq , said additional information was needed .
" there is nothing in the report about the effort to procure aluminium tubes .
that is the kind of evidence we need , " said iaea director mohamed elbaradei .
new inspections iraq 's deputy un ambassador mohammed salmane insisted the arms declaration was " complete and comprehensive " and would be borne out by un inspectors .
but the un 's chief weapons inspector , hans blix , also criticised the declaration .
" there has been relatively little given in the declaration by way of evidence concerning the programmes of weapons of mass destruction , " mr blix said after briefing the security council .
mr blix said evidence that weapons that were known to exist in the 1990s had really been destroyed was missing from the document .
promising further analysis and new inspections , he added that he and mr elbaradei would return to the security council on 27 january .

uk prime minister tony blair on monday invited palestinian ministers to london in january , for a conference on palestinian " reforms " .
there 's about as much chance of having significant reforms under arafat as there are ... under saddam hussein binyamin netanyahu israeli foreign minister but binyamin netanyahu said the talks would be futile as long as yasser arafat - not himself invited to the talks - was leader of the palestinian authority .
mr netanyahu , who is flying to london on friday for a meeting with british foreign secretary jack straw , said there was no political room for reform under mr arafat 's leadership .
syria visit criticised " i 'd like to hear what prime minister blair has in mind , " mr netanyahu told a news conference in rome .
" if he 's talking about changing palestinian politics , changing palestinian economy , changing palestinian education , that would be a welcome thing .
mr netanyahu said the uk 's invitation to syria rewarded terrorists " but if he 's entrusting this to arafat there 's about as much chance of having significant reforms in any of these areas under arafat as there are ... any significant reforms under saddam hussein . "
mr netanyahu also criticised london for hosting syrian president bashar al-assad earlier this week .
" to win the war on terror you need moral and political clarity and consistency , " he said .
" for example i think it 's a mistake to invite the leader of a terrorist state par excellence , like bashar al-assad , to european capitals because it sends a message that terror pays . "
in september , mr arafat scheduled the first palestinian general election since 1996 for january after coming under intense pressure at home and abroad to introduce sweeping democratic reforms .
earlier this month , he said the 20 january ballot would have to be postponed unless israeli forces withdrew from west bank cities which they reoccupied after a wave of suicide bombings against israelis .
israel blames mr arafat for palestinian militant attacks and refuses to negotiate with him .
' road map ' the palestinian authority says its efforts to crack down on radical groups have been hindered by israeli occupation and military attacks on its infrastructure .
the london talks will run parallel to efforts by the united states , the european union , the united nations and russia to draw up a " road map " for peace in the region and lay the groundwork for a palestinian state .
the british conference will be attended by mr blair and chaired by foreign secretary mr straw .
egypt , saudi arabia and jordan have also been asked to send representatives .
israel is not expected to attend the talks , and has asked the us to delay adoption of the so-called road map until after its own general elections in late january . watch / listen on this story israeli foreign minister benjamin netanyahu " the palestinian people has no choice in who is their leader " key stories israel 's early elections bombs and labour israel seeks us cash hamas resurgent profiles ariel sharon binyamin netanyahu amram mitzna yasser arafat factfile voices from the conflict talking point what will stop the suicide bombings ?

grampian university hospitals nhs trust is set to lose four posts after being penalised under the scottish executive 's " three strikes and you 're out " rule .
the executive has warned that trusts must comply with new deal terms over doctors ' hours or face losing staff .
six more posts in scotland are also at risk , including positions in three other parts of the country .
we have endeavoured to look at patients ' safety ... and in so doing are not willing to compromise that for an hours target dr clifford eastmond grampian hospitals nhs trust the executive said the trusts had only themselves to blame for their problems after being given " ample opportunity " to satisfy the terms of the new deal .
the government 's new deal for junior doctors was introduced in 1991 .
by august last year , all training doctors in their final year of medical education were supposed to be working no more than an average of 56 hours a week .
despite two warnings , the rotas at the cardiothoracic department at grampian university hospitals trust in aberdeen still did not comply .
the trust said it had received a letter saying approval for four posts in the department had been withdrawn .
compliance ' vital ' the latest edition of the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- news says that grampian also risks losing three further posts , while fife , south glasgow and west lothian trusts may each lose one general medical post .
the british medical association said it was " ridiculous " that any trust failed to comply with the new deal .
the chairman of its scottish junior doctors committee , jim mccaul , said : " i am disappointed that it has come to this in grampian , but -lrb- the stripped posts -rrb- should be seen as a warning to trusts that they have to get this right for the sake of junior doctors and patients .
we are very disappointed that grampian have not taken the chances given to them mary mulligan , junior health minister " i am pleased the executive has lived up to its word and withdrawn approval for the posts .
" it sends a message that new deal compliance is vital . "
deputy health minister mary mulligan said : " we are very disappointed that grampian have not taken the chances given to them previously to put in place the correct rotas to ensure that they are compliant .
" therefore we have had to take the actions we have , which is to withdraw the training posts from the trust . "
she said funding for the training posts would be removed from the trust as soon as the staff were moved to another hospital .
" however , we will continue to work with the trust to try to reinstate those posts and at that stage the funding would be returned , " said ms mulligan .
inadequate levels the trust will have 18 months to comply with the regulations .
however , assistant medical director dr clifford eastmond defended the trust 's actions .
" it is certainly possible to write rotas which are compliant , " he said .
" it is certainly possible to ensure that junior doctors work to those rotas as much as possible .
" the problem is that some of those compliant rotas leave some very inadequate levels of doctors at some times .
