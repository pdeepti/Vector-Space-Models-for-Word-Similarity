but today , north korea has been added to a us state department list of countries which washington says denies religious freedom to its people .
anyone can become a christian if they want to and everyone is free to practice their faith chang sung bok pastor at pongsu church north korea 's constitution grants freedom of religious belief , but also states that no-one should use religion as a means to drag in foreign powers or to destroy the state or social order .
three churches operate in pyongyang - but human rights groups say that outside officially sanctioned churches , north korean christians can face harsh penalties .
there are about 12,000 practising christians in north korea , and those who can not come to church are able to worship in small groups in homes .
foreign delegations the pastor chang sung bok at pongsu church in pyongyang insists there are no controls .
" there 's no religious persecution .
anyone can become a christian if they want to and everyone is free to practice their faith , " he said .
" and there are more than 500 house churches throughout the country where christians can go to pray , " he added .
to counter the critics , officials are allowing more foreigners to visit its churches - including a south korean christian delegation , which i joined .
" at a time when inter-korean relations are facing difficulty , we christians should work harder than ever .
by building contacts with north korea , we can help to bring peace to the korean peninsula , " said reverend kim dong wan , a member of the delegation .
reunification hope reverend bok agrees with his counterpart from the south that the visits are a good thing .
" through these visits we exchange our views mainly on the peaceful reunification of our country .
we pray for the reunification and through this prayers , we hope reunification can come closer , " he said .
the constitution says there is religion , but it is only on paper kim sang chul human rights campaigner but upon returning to south korea , reverend wan explained that despite his visits to churches in the north it was still impossible to verify just how free people were to worship .
" its impossible to tell how much they represent genuine opportunities for worship , or are simply showcase churches for visitors .
i 'm not given the chance to talk to any of the congregation , " he said .
from what i witnessed at pongsu church , there was little sign of spontaneity .
nor were there any signs of festive spirit - though i was told that the church is decorated on christmas day .
crackdown critics - including the us state department - believe independent religious activity is banned in the north .
they say there are many reports of crackdowns against christian members of underground churches and those who have had contact with foreign missionaries .
kim sang chul is secretary general of a south korean non-governmental group helping defectors , which is affiliated to a church group in seoul .
" you know in north korea there is a god named kim il-sung .
when one believes in god , not in kim il-sung or his successor , kim jong-il , it means it is real betrayal or defection against the nation , " he said .
" the constitution says there is religion , but it is only on paper , " he added .
fraught relations churchgoers , i notice , do not openly wear the badge that all north koreans prominently display - depicting the late kim il-sung , or his son , the current leader , kim jong-il .
but allegations of religious repression in north korea are hard to verify - its one of the most secretive countries in the world .
the us state department report has been angrily rejected by north korea 's official media - and it is likely to increase already tense relations between the two countries .

a television programme being screened on sunday on bbc two at 2100 gmt reveals how forbidden love and political frustration drove crown prince dipendra to murder .
interviews with massacre survivors , royal cousins , courtiers and friends allow viewers a new insight into the secretive nepalese royal family and dismiss conspiracy theories that the crown prince was not the murderer .
all his life he had always got what he wanted - nobody would say no to a crown prince gorahk rana dipendra 's brother-in-law in an emotional interview , princess ketaki , dipendra 's aunt , who was present at the massacre , reveals that the crown prince 's attack was premeditated and not , as some reports suggested at the time , the result of him taking a combination of drink and drugs .
she tells how the crown prince looked before he shot his father , king birendra : " he looked exactly like the terminator , absolutely expressionless and very focused , and that look still haunts me .
" he was out there spraying bullets like a madman .
he was kicking bodies and just shooting them at close range just to ensure that they had died . "
frustration the programme also reveals how the crown prince became increasingly frustrated at his role within the royal family .
in 1990 , the people of nepal took to the streets to demand an end to absolute monarchy and the introduction of multi-party democracy .
fearing a revolution , king birendra caved into their demands .
princess ketaki claims that the crown prince was frustrated at the thought of fulfilling the role of a modern monarch and was reluctant to relinquish the feudal role of absolute king .
forbidden love the tragedy was fuelled by the king 's refusal to let the crown prince marry his lover , devyani rana , who he met in 1989 .
the crown prince 's mother , queen aishwarya , was particularly opposed to the union because devyani rana 's mother came from the royal family of the indian state of gwalior - considered to be of lower social status than the nepalese royal family .
devyani 's father was also a politician , and came from a rival clan to the queen 's .
ten years on from his first meeting with devyani rana , crown prince dipendra was given an ultimatum by his parents - his royal position or marriage to his lover .
crown prince dipendra 's brother-in-law , gorahk rana , who was married to dipendra 's sister , princess shruti , remembers the crown prince 's surprise : " all his life he had always got what he wanted .
nobody would say no to a crown prince . "
tragedy on 1 june 2001 , crown prince dipendra went on the shooting spree in the royal palace , killing his parents , sister , younger brother and five other royals .
crown prince dipendra was found with a single bullet wound through the head .
on 2 june he was proclaimed king , but died two days later in hospital .
his uncle , gyanendra , became nepal 's third king in three days .
devyani rana fled nepal and is reported to be in europe .
her uncle , the maharajah of kashmir and an indian politician , dr karen singh , says she is also a victim : " devyani was no less a victim than the people who were actually killed .
she was lucky to escape alive , but the psychological toll it took on her was very deep . "

news of a possible scientific breakthrough in the quest for a reliable lie-detector throws the spotlight on the age-old problem of sorting out lies from truth .
the business of sifting truth from lies is literally heating up .
in the united states scientists claim to have come up with a lie detector that uses a super-sensitive thermal imaging camera to spot minute heat rushes around the eyes .
we are reaching the point where we will have no alternative other than to use truth serums on the suspects we are holding fbi source quoted by the washington post at the same time , the us authorities are contemplating the use of " truth serums " to obtain information about terror groups .
the problem of working out who is lying and who is telling the truth - especially in the fields of international diplomacy and the legal system - is as old as civilisation itself .
but the idea that a person 's truthfulness can be detected , regardless of what they are actually saying , may be not much more than a throwback to ancient ideas of trial by ordeal .
in english medieval courts truth was tested by ordeals of fire and water , on the basis a truthful person would be protected by god .
someone suspected of lying would have to carry a red-hot iron bar for nine paces .
alternatively he could opt to walk across nine red-hot ploughshares .
either way , if the suspect was burned then this was proof that he was lying and so could be promptly hung .
other courts went in for trial by water .
in the ultimate " no-win " situation , the person accused of lying was put into a sack and thrown into a pond .
if the accused sank this showed he was innocent , but he might well drown anyway .
if he floated this was taken proof that he was lying and he would be hanged .
such practices were ended in 1215 by edict of the latern council .
by the 1600s the idea arose that the truth of any statement could be arrived at by the means of detailed questioning and the application of scientific and logical reasoning to what was being said .
modern legal conventions of cross-examination and the presumption that somebody is telling the truth unless it can be proved otherwise " beyond reasonable doubt " date from this time .
the philosopher descartes wrote that " the power of distinguishing the true from the false , which is properly speaking what is called good sense or reason , is by nature equal in all men " .
trying to work out whether somebody was lying was a matter of questioning , debate and the clash between different points of view based on the gathering and analysis of evidence .
the 19th century saw a reversion to ideas of truthfulness and lying as moral conditions embedded in the unique personality of the accused person .
the new " sciences " of phrenology - measurement of " bumps " on a person 's skull - and psychology - led to the idea that lies could be detected by looking at physical symptoms .
it was eventually argued by phrenologists that pathological liars and " criminal personality " could be determined by measuring the shape of a person 's skull .
psychologists concentrated on of past personal life , " personality type " and even the content of someone 's dreams .
phrenological " evidence " of criminal personality type was presented in victorian murder trials and used to secure conviction of " guilty types " whose evidence could not be relied upon .
the search for " scientific " ways of spotting liars moved from bumps on the head to brain chemistry , with the search for a " truth serum " drug .
barbiturates including scopolamine , sodium amytal and sodium pentothal were given to suspects in the hope that drugs could somehow rewire the brain , making it incapable of telling a deliberate lie .
the " medicine " had the intended effect of causing the victim to lose control over what he was saying .
but the result was normally an endless stream of drug-addled gibberish rather than " the truth " .
in 1963 the us supreme court said " serum-induced confession " was in effect a form of torture and the practice was ruled unconstitutional .
the latest attempt at scientific detection of truth and falsehood comes , fashionably enough , in the application of sophisticated electronics to the problem .
makers of the latest lie detector machine - which measures supposedly tell-tale changes in temperature around the eye sockets when somebody is telling a deliberate untruth - claim a " success rate " of 83 % in detecting liars .
but whether it will prove any more reliable that conventional " polygraph " lie detectors , which rely on sensors to detect breathing rate , pulse , blood pressure and perspiration , remains open to question .
