europe is sending an unmanned spacecraft to map the satellite early in 2003 .
the mission , smart-1 , will fly over all of the apollo landing sites in the process .
i think the conspiracy theorists will always believe what they want to believe no matter what the scientists say dr sara russell , natural history museum meanwhile , us scientists are calling on their space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- to seriously consider sending spacecraft , rovers , and even astronauts back " up there " .
it comes amid conflicting reports that the emerging space power , china , may launch a manned moon mission .
the new interest in lunar exploration stems in part from the desire to understand how life on earth began .
earthly fossils many scientists believe dust on the moon contains relics of rocks blasted off the face of the earth about four billion years ago by comets and asteroids .
lunar craters could even harbour fossils of some of earth 's earliest microbial life , according to a team of us scientists .
craters on the moon betray its violent past " the most exciting discovery would be actual preserved fossils or even original organic fragments of early life , " says guillermo gonzalez , assistant professor of physics and astronomy at iowa state university .
" we expect them to be relatively rare ; most fragments from the earth will be melted rock , " he told bbc news online .
" but even the melted rock bits will be useful in helping us date the individual impact events on the earth , which are presently unknown . "
dr gonzalez is one of three us scientists who air their views in the forthcoming edition of the international astronomy journal icarus .
' only place ' co-author john armstrong of the university of washington says there are good reasons for taking a new look at the moon .
" a nasa researcher , kevin zahnle , said : ' it is not that the moon is the best place to look , it is the only place ' , " he told bbc news online .
mr armstrong says the most likely option for searching for fossils on the moon is a robotic mission .
but he thinks grabbing a chunk of rock " with earth 's name on it " is a task better suited to astronauts .
" people can scan a surface and spot odd looking rocks much better than a robot , " he says .
" a robot would have to grab a bunch of soil and sift through it piece by piece .
" i do n't advocate sending a manned mission just to look for earth rocks , " he adds .
" but if we do go back , we should keep our eyes open . "
deep space the next opportunity to go back to the moon is in early 2003 when the european space agency launches its smart-1 mission .
the main objective is to test a new type of engine technology - solar electric propulsion - which could power future missions very long distances into deep space .
solar propulsion could help us explore deep space in the process , the mission will attempt to answer questions that have long fascinated humankind : how was the moon formed ?
what role did it play in the early history of the earth ?
orion , the lunar module dropped by apollo 16 on 21 april 1972 , carried six hand-held cameras to photograph the moon 's surface .
in contrast , smart-1 will be using the latest x-ray and infrared imaging techniques to map the moon 's surface more accurately than before .
some of the scientific instruments are being built in the uk .
dr sara russell , a meteorite researcher at london 's natural history museum , says the data should help plug gaps in our knowledge of the moon .
conspiracy theories " the apollo missions in their day were an incredible technological advance but they still left a lot of questions unanswered , " she told bbc news online .
smart-1 mission aims to look for the first time at the darker parts of the moon 's south pole to map the peak of eternal light , the mountain bathed in sunlight to help scientists to understand if ice is present at the lunar poles the apollo astronauts brought back 382 kg of lunar rock and three unmanned soviet probes returned another 300 g .
but the samples were taken from particular places on the lunar surface , which do not necessarily represent the moon as a whole .
" what we want to do on the smart-1 mission is look at the composition of the entire moon , " says dr russell , so could the new data satisfy conspiracy theorists who believe the moon landings never happened , once and for all ?
" i think the conspiracy theorists will always believe what they want to believe no matter what the scientists say , " says dr russell .

some 18,000 seals in northern europe died of the highly infectious phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- in 1988 .
the virus returned to denmark in may 2002 and has so far killed 2,000 seals in denmark , sweden and the netherlands .
wildlife experts say it is only a matter of time before the disease return to british shores .
about 3,000 seals died off the coast of norfolk in the 1988 epidemic .
post-mortem tests are being carried out at the norfolk wildlife hospital on the two seals found near skegness this week .
a spokeswoman for the rspca said : " although we have n't found distemper we are very worried , we know it 's imminent and it 's bound to hit our shores .
" we are worried because it 's taken 12 years to get back to the figures of seals there were in 1988 . "

some 18,000 seals in northern europe died of the highly infectious phocine distemper virus -lrb- pdv -rrb- in 1988 .
the virus returned to denmark in may 2002 and has so far killed 2,000 seals in denmark , sweden and the netherlands .
wildlife experts say it is only a matter of time before the disease return to british shores .
distemper has hit denmark , sweden and the netherlands about 3,000 seals died off the coast of norfolk in the 1988 epidemic .
post-mortem tests are being carried out at the norfolk wildlife hospital on the two seals found near skegness this week .
a spokeswoman for the rspca said : " although we have n't found distemper we are very worried , we know it 's imminent and it 's bound to hit our shores .
" we are worried because it 's taken 12 years to get back to the figures of seals there were in 1988 . "
ian robinson , rspca veterinary manager at the hospital near king 's lynn , said : " we hope it 's not as destructive as last time but it 's a vicious virus .
" it 's not so much when it 's going to hit the uk but how badly . "

first minister rhodri morgan joined 300 of the 800 staff for a crisis meeting on saturday .
the castle works plant in tremorfa closed on friday after attempts by receivers kpmg to find a buyer for the site failed .
the meeting - attended by officials from the istc steel union - began at 0930bst at the railway club in sanqhuar street , splott , cardiff .
workers have been told that the fund - which showed a £ 21m deficit on 31 december last year - had worsened with the continuing fall of the stock market .
the bbc 's personal finance correspondent , andrew verity , said existing asw pensioners would be the first in the queue to receive whatever funds existed . "
the workforce are at the bottom of the ladder " carl webber , asw worker that would prove a big drain on the scheme leaving not much for the remaining workers .
" if a company goes bust and a pension scheme is not fully funded , unfortunately some workers will not get all their benefits . "
workers at the cardiff plant will meet on saturday to seek legal advice .
employees such as carl webber , with more than 25 years of service at asw , are anxious about the state of the pension fund .
" my basic understanding is that if there 's any money left over after paying the creditors , the workforce , at the bottom of the ladder , will be paid , " said mr webber .
the disastrous downturn on the world markets has seen more than 20 % wiped off many company pensions , creating a double blow for asw staff .
on friday , cardiff council called on the welsh assembly to take immediate action to help those laid off .
they demanded an urgent meeting with first minister rhodri morgan , and an assurance that the former employees be given the same sort of support as was given to redundant corus workers .
" there are more people living in deprived areas in cardiff than anywhere else in the country , " said councillor marion drake , cabinet member for enterprise .
she said the council was working with others to do what they could to help the situation but it was the assembly which had the power to make a real difference .
many employees failed to turn up for work at thetremorfa plant since receivers kpmg revealed earlier this week that the site was closing .
there is still a chance a buyer for the asw works could be found and workers re-employed , but kpmg took the decision to close the plant ahead of the annual august shutdown .
the welsh assembly said it was powerless under eu competition rules to step in and help save asw .
more than 100 workers at the castle nails plant - which is on the same site - will keep their jobs , following interest from other firms .
asw has blamed harsh trading conditions for its downturn , with the influx of cheap european imports and increasing costs of raw materials .
kpmg said the firm 's history of trading at a loss meant it could not allow asw to continue trading .
istc general secretary michael leahy said it was " devastating news " for workers .
asw went into receivership on 10 july .
the firm 's share price had dropped to just 2.5p after riding high at more than 100 times as much at its peak .

the exhibition ' themes and variations : a select retrospective ' concentrates on the musical and poetic themes that influenced the career of ceri richards over four decades .
next year sees the centenary of the artist who grew up in dunvant near swansea and trained at the swansea school of art and royal college of london .
he died in 1971 .
the pianist no 2 painted by richards in 1948 curator mel gooding believes the exhibition , the first major show of richards ' since the tate , will open the doors for a re-examination of the artist 's work .
" one of the things about the show is that i hope it begins an appraisal of richards ' work , " said the critic .
he has drawn together 70 pieces by the artist , some in public collections here and abroad , and others borrowed from private ownership .
some works have deliberately been left out of gooding 's choice .
but the retrospective charts richards ' inspiration , sometimes drawn from the forceful poetry of dylan thomas and at others from the musical preludes of debussy .
for the first time the art is presented in a series of five themes and , according to gooding , does away with any notion that richards was not methodical and was always changing direction .
' dazzling virtuosity ' " few artists of his time have encompassed such oppositions of subject , theme and mood .
" richards ' extraordinary versatility enabled him to shift styles and to treat his subjects with a dazzling virtuosity .
" one thing about this show is that it gives you a very clear and in depth picture of how concentrated his work could be . "
from cardiff a selected exhibition will go on to tour visiting leeds- where one of richards ' work is still on display since a major surrealist show in the 1980s - and the glyn vivian art gallery in swansea .
" i hope the exhibition in swansea will help form the centre piece of the centenary celebrations , " said gooding .
one disappointment , however , is that the show will not go on to london , where a lack of a suitably big art space has been a factor .
' themes and variations : a select retrospective ' is at the national museum and gallery of wales until 27 october ; leeds city art gallery from 16 january to 30 march , 2003 ; and glyn vivian art gallery from 3 may to 29 june , 2003 .

he arrives in delhi on saturday and later moves on to pakistan , before visiting six countries in south-east asia .
both india and pakistan feel they have made more than enough concessions to the united states mr powell is still the " rock star " of the bush administration - the one with unrivalled charisma and enduring popularity , both at home and abroad .
but that is proving no guarantee of success - either in washington or abroad .
the immediate threat of war between india and pakistan may have receded , but the situation between the two countries is still very tense .
colin powell will be attempting to stabilise relations for the longer term .
dialogue he will be looking for the reopening of direct talks between india and pakistan .
" i will see if there are any other actions that can be taken that will reduce the level of violence or the potential for violence , " mr powell told reporters before leaving washington .
kashmir - powell hopes for a dialogue over the disputed region " i 'm sure we will have discussions on the possibility of a dialogue at some point in the future between the two sides that will deal with the question of kashmir . "
but on this , his third visit in less than a year , the secretary of state could receive quite a frosty reception .
as yet , no meeting with the indian prime minister has been scheduled - there is even some doubt over whether mr powell will see the pakistani president , pervez musharraf .
hardening attitudes both india and pakistan feel they have made more than enough concessions to the united states .
powell tour india pakistan thailand malaysia singapore brunei indonesia philippines the prospect of elections in both countries in the next few months is also hardening attitudes .
" musharraf can not be seen to give any more .
he 's not in a position to go any further because it will be difficult for him politically , " explained aqil shah , an analyst with the international crisis group .
by contrast the indian foreign ministry spokeswoman , nirupama rao , warned that delhi would convey its concern over what it believes is continuing infiltration by militants across the line of control - the ceasefire line that separates indian- and pakistani-controlled kashmir .
powell 's future mr powell may be on surer ground when he goes on to south-east asia - where there are important issues to discuss on the war on terror .
the secretary of state will be looking for more co-operation on freezing the financial assets of those suspected of terrorism .
for some reason the press feels it is necessary every two weeks to write a story about whether i am up or whether i am down colin powell he will also be looking at possible further military co-operation with the philippine and indonesian governments .
this trip comes at a time when questions are asked , almost daily , about mr powell 's own future within the bush administration .
president bush 's decision to stop funding the un population fund is just the latest of a series of policy reverses suffered by mr powell .
he is known to be a reluctant supporter of the policy of isolating yasser arafat .
and from the first days of the administration he has advocated a dialogue with the north koreans which has still not got off the ground .
bad patch ironically , mr powell is one of the most popular secretaries of state within his own department for perhaps two decades .
staff at " state " are enjoying having a boss who seems genuinely to care for their welfare - even while their department 's influence dwindles within the administration .
mr powell himself answer those questions about his future with a weary denial : " now for all those resignation stories , i do n't know , " he told one group of reporters earlier this week .
" i can go back and do a lexis-nexis -lsb- a computer search -rsb- and you 've been doing them every two weeks since i came in here last year , but i 'm sure you 'll continue to do them .
it 's great reading . "
to another group of reporters he said : " for some reason the press feels it is necessary every two weeks to write a story about whether i am up or whether i am down , whether i am in or whether i am out , and whether i am going to resign or whether i 'm going to stay forever . "
" but i have no intentions to resign , no plans to resign . "
those who know him say mr powell is not the sort of person who would even consider resigning .
but within the internal policy battles inside the bush administration he certainly seems to be going through a bad patch .
