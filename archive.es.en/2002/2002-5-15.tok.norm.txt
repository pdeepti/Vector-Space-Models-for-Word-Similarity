the auditors said efforts to clamp down on licence dodgers were being hampered by lack of accurate information .
as a result , last year a fifth of visits made by inquiry officers - 646,000 calls - were to properties that were either vacant or still under construction .

scientists have found that brisk walking has a much more beneficial effect on health .
my advice would be for people to share the housework with their partner and then for both of them to go and do something more energetic professor shah embrahim the finding raises a question mark about public health policy in recent years .
there has been a shift in policy from recommending three bouts of vigorous exercise a week to more moderate activity that fits into a daily routine .
this includes housework such as vacuum cleaning and window cleaning , gardening , and diy , on the grounds that this confers health benefits and will be more feasible , especially for older people .
the researchers selected over 2,300 women aged between 60 and 79 from 15 british towns .
lifestyle questions previous research has indicated that most women in this age group are relatively inactive .
the women gave details of how much exercise they took each week .
this included walking , cycling , fitness classes , sport , gardening , diy and housework .
when heavy housework was included in the tally , over two thirds of the women reached recommended levels of physical activity .
but when this was excluded , only one in five reached target levels .
in general women who took little exercise were more likely to suffer from poor health , in particular heart or respiratory disease .
those who walked briskly for at least 2.5 hours a week were much less likely to be obese , or to show signs of heart and lung problems .
however , heavy housework produced no such positive effect .
no benefit the researchers say that defining housework as a vigorous physical activity may mean that a larger proportion of people will achieve exercise targets - but they say that their work suggests that it will do little to improve the general health of the population .
the list used in the paper seems to be significantly less active than previous classifications hugo crombie lead researcher professor shah ebrahim , of the university of bristol , told bbc news online that it might be that older women did not gain any health benefit from heavy housework because they did it in a relatively leisurely way .
but he said : " my advice would be for people to share the housework with their partner and then for both of them to go and do something more energetic than might confer health benefits . "
professor ebrahim said that lack of exercise was a problem among all age groups .
classification hugo crombie , the health development agency 's public health adviser on physical activity , said the type of housework classed as heavy activity in the study could in part be responsible for the conclusion that there is little benefit to health from domestic activity .
in the study paper examples include hoovering and window cleaning , while the health survey for england uses walking with heavy shopping for more than five minutes , moving heavy furniture and scrubbing floors .
mr crombie said : " the list used in the paper seems to be significantly less active than previous classifications and this difference in activity levels could account for this new research finding little benefit to health . "

the rebound in the health of asian economies as well as china 's own meant that industrial output was 12.1 % up in april over the previous year , beating the government 's target of 9 % growth .
sustained surge both numbers show an acceleration over the performance for the first quarter of 2002 , after a sharp slowdown - as in the rest of the world - in the last three months of 2001 .

de niro has produced the musical , which was written by comedian and author ben elton .
queen 's guitarist brian may also attended with his wife , former eastenders soap opera star anita dobson .
" the show gives new life to most of the songs .
the actors are fantastic and just take you to another place , " said may .
" we 're hoping it will run for about 20 years , " he joked .
the futuristic £ 7.5m production , six years in the making , is one of the most expensive musicals ever staged in london .
playing at the dominion theatre , it portrays a world where musical instruments have been banned , and boy bands and girl bands dominate .
but a group of rebels set out to find mythical electric guitars which were set in stone many years earlier .
the idea for the musical hit de niro more than six years ago when he met queen members brian may and roger taylor at the venice film festival .
the actor has said that the idea was something he was " interested in " and that he knew it would be a " great idea " for a musical .
originally there were plans to base the musical on the story of the band queen , but guitarist may has said that would have been " embarrassing " for the figures involved .
queen were one of the biggest bands in the world in the late 1970s and 1980s but lost their main creative force and lead singer freddie mercury , when he died in 1991 .
' painful ' taylor told the evening standard newspaper that he " could n't bear the idea " of a musical based on the band 's history .
he added : " it would be too painful , too close , and a bit grand .
it would be for somebody else to do .
you ca n't supervise your own history . "
we will rock you weaves in lyrics and characters from some of the band 's best-known hits - bohemian rhapsody , radio ga ga and i want to break free .
the story features a hero , galileo , who is trying to find electric guitars because there is no rock music .
however he is being chased by the ga ga cops who want to bring him to the killer queen .
actor nigel planer , who has starred in the young ones and comic strip , is one of the show 's stars .

sewage is among the waste spread on land the villagers set up an action group in 1997 to complain about the problems they say are associated with the waste spreading .
there have been complaints of sore throats , eye infections , rashes and even scarlet fever .
but there is no actual evidence that the waste has caused illnesses .
mid scotland fife msp george reid is delighted that the investigation is to be reconvened .
in march , the scottish parliament 's environment committee said in a report that the rules on animal waste disposal should be tightened .
it also called for a full review of the health and environmental side-effects of recycling sewage on land as an organic fertiliser .
national importance msps said they were surprised and concerned to learn that the law permitted such waste disposal with little regulation .
msps said it was an issue of national importance as other communities in scotland had also complained about the method of waste disposal .
the msps also called for the creation of a special investigation team by sepa to consider the effects of sewage and waste spreading on public health and the environment .
mr reid said the health inquiry team should have taken evidence from the villagers .

under the plan , kingfisher will issue new shares worth £ 2bn in order to help fund the purchase of the 45 % stake in castorama that it does not already own .
the company said on wednesday that it planned to offer £ 3.2bn for the outstanding castorama stock .
the deal is aimed at consolidating kingfisher 's diy operations , which also include the b & q chain in the uk .
at present , kingfisher does not have full management control over castorama despite owning 55 % of its shares .
electrical goods split kingfisher said it also planned to set up a separate company to run its electrical goods retail business , which includes the uk 's comet chain and darty in france .
" the moves announced today are designed to capture the full potential of our group and so enhance value for our shareholders , " said kingfisher chairman francis mackay .
kingfisher added that it had started looking for a successor to its chief executive sir geoff mulcahy , who has been in the job for 20 years .
the overhaul is designed to restore investor confidence in the company , battered by the underperformance of castorama relative to b & q. kingfisher 's own share price has lagged that of other major british retailers in recent months , despite a sustained boom in property prices and consumer spending .
the company 's stock edged slightly lower in early trade on wednesday in response to the new share issue , falling 3p to 382p .

a report from the cross-party health committee raises the prospect of possible conflicts of interest when consultants do both private and nhs work .
the mps also express concerns that paying for some patients to have private treatment in a bid to cut waiting lists may not represent value for money .
they are concerned that the nhs may become too dependent on private health care , putting private hospitals in a position where they can increase prices in the longer term .
nhs links with private sector 60,000 nhs patients have operations in the private sector every year there are 11 pfi hospitals - more than 50 others are being planned 75 % of nhs consultants do some private work but they also found that private finance initiatives -lrb- pfi -rrb- - where contractors pay for construction and lease finished buildings back to the nhs - is still being blamed for " numerous ills " not directly related to it .
the report has prompted a senior member of health workers union unison to accuse the government of undermining the nhs .
geoff martin , unison 's london convenor , told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " i do not think they are wedded and committed to the principle of an national health service at all .
" i think they want to see it broken up and fragmented in a way that even the thatcherites would have baulked at . "

pfi is still being blamed for numerous ills not directly related to it health committee report it said some may decide it is to their advantage to keep nhs waiting lists long , so more patients come to them for private treatment .
the new report says very few would exploit their position .
but it does call for a formal job plan outlining how much work they are expected to do for the nhs .
direct threat the committee warns of regional inequalities in the standard of care patients receive because of differences in the way the private sector is used .
it also found wide variations in the cost of private treatments used and called for an urgent review by the audit commission .
the report suggests the nhs can use the independent sector in the short-term , where it has too little capacity .
hinchliffe hopes using the private sector can be avoided in future but it says it is crucial to ensure the nhs itself has the capacity , resources and staff to keep down waiting times .
it warns money aimed at cutting lists should not be directed solely towards use of the independent sector , but to whatever services would best serve local need - including the nhs .
the report said it had still to be shown that using the private sector more posed no threat to nhs resources .
committee chairman david hinchliffe told today : " we believe that the nhs itself must develop sufficient acute capacity to avoid in future having to make use of the private sector . "
the extra money promised by ministers should make that possible , he added .
transparent the committee says pfi may have become a " convenient scapegoat " for problems such as reductions in bed numbers , which were actually down to poor bed planning .
" pfi is still being blamed for numerous ills not directly related to it whereas the many benefits to pfi have yet to be proved , " it said .
it calls for decisions about pfis to be more open and transparent .
staff in pfi hospitals have regularly complained they have problems because of basic errors in the way they are built .
the health committee says in future pfis , staff should have a greater input into the building 's design - even to the extent of asking for a mock-up of a whole ward to be constructed in advance of building work .

a spokesman for the department of health said : " it is particularly encouraging to see that the committee have scotched some of the common myths and scare stories about pfi . "
but the conservative shadow health secretary liam fox accused the committee of being more concerned keeping the system than helping patients .
dr fox said : " it completely overlooks the huge amount which the private sector has already done in helping to tackle the shortcomings of the nhs . "

in the latest good omens , motorbike maker yamaha motor and car firm mazda both announced higher profits on wednesday .
but the healthy state of firms like yamaha and mazda belies the continuing depression gripping the domestic market .
the result is a mismatch between imports and exports to and from japan , which widened in march for the sixth month in a row .
without a solid improvement in domestic demand , economists say , the chances of a proper recovery in japan are slim to none .
tipping the scales the imbalance showed up in a leap in the current account surplus , the widest measure of import-export performance , of more than 50 % compared to a year ago to 2.2 trillion yen -lrb- $ 17.1bn ; £ 11.8bn -rrb- .
the figure was the second highest since march 1993 , and was considerably bigger than many economists had expected .
exports were down 2.9 % on the previous year , although the decline has slowed sharply .
but imports , meanwhile , were down 12.3 % on the year .
the export strength could well be enough to break japan out of its series of three straight quarters of contraction .
trouble at home but exports only make up 10 % of the overall economy .
without a rise in consumer spending - difficult because prices are falling in japan and the once-prolific japanese shopper long ago turned cautious amid rising unemployment and insecurity - growth would be unsustainable .
" the recovery in the global economy is the main factor for the rise in the trade surplus , " a ministry of finance official told reporters .
" looking forward , the main point will be whether domestic , capital spending will pick up . "
bikes in demand the performance of the motor firms offers some consolation .
yamaha told investors that its net profits for the year ending in march were 9.54bn yen -lrb- $ 74.3m ; £ 51.3m -rrb- , up 25.3 % on the year before .
sales , meanwhile , were up 7.1 % to 946.82bn yen , an all-time record as it restructured to cut costs and rescue its domestic business .
with sales in north america firm and the yen remaining weak , the company said it hopes to boost global market share to 20 % in 2010 from 8 % now .
in the nearer term , the current year should see net profit more than double , it said .
mazda turnaround mazda , too , reported a rosy picture , back in the black in 2001-2 after recording a loss the previous year .
consolidated net profit for the group was 8.83bn yen , mazda said , a huge turnaround from the 155.24bn yen loss in 2000-2001 after six years of restructuring led by one-third owner ford .
mazda , too , promised profits would double in the year ahead - although the balance of overseas sales would shift from north america to europe .

the company said on wednesday that pre-tax profits for the year to late march rose 11 % on the previous year to £ 355m , while sales edged up 5 % to £ 9.4bn.
safeway added that its refurbishment programme - aimed at offering customers a wider range of foods in an " attractive and appealing " environment - continued apace , with 71 stores now refitted .
but it acknowledged that in-store construction work deterred some shoppers , trimming sales growth during the final six months of the year .
builders displace shoppers " during the second half , the sales lost from stores undergoing transformation was greater than the sales gained from those relaunched , " the company said in a statement .
but safeway predicted that revenue growth will pick up again as the store overhaul nears completion .
" we expect performance in the remainder of our first quarter to progressively strengthen as the pace of new format store relaunches picks up , " said safeway chief executive carlos criado-perez .
in the city , safeway shares fell 9.5p to 308p in early trade on wednesday .

the company said on wednesday that pre-tax profits for the year to late march rose 11 % on the previous year to £ 355m , while sales edged up 5 % to £ 9.4bn.
safeway added that its refurbishment programme - aimed at offering customers a wider range of foods in an " attractive and appealing " environment - continued apace , with 71 stores now refitted .
but it acknowledged that in-store construction work deterred some shoppers , trimming sales growth during the final six months of the year .
builders displace shoppers " during the second half , the sales lost from stores undergoing transformation was greater than the sales gained from those relaunched , " the company said in a statement .
but safeway predicted that revenue growth will pick up again as the store overhaul nears completion .
" we expect performance in the remainder of our first quarter to progressively strengthen as the pace of new format store relaunches picks up , " said safeway chief executive carlos criado-perez .
in the city , safeway shares fell 9.5p to 308p in early trade on wednesday .

defence minister daniel chea made the announcement after the authorities had instructed all military personnel to report to the main barracks in the capital , monrovia .
mr chea said government forces had been fighting rebels - who call themselves liberians united for reconciliation and democracy -lrb- lurd -rrb- - in the strategic town of gbarnga in central liberia .
earlier , the government said the rebels had been driven out of the town of arthington , 25 kilometres from the capital .
the liberian authorities say a united nations arms embargo has hindered their attempts to defeat the lurd which , they claim , has overwhelming external support .
the un and lurd accuse the liberian government of destabilising the region .
chaos fierce fighting was reported on monday in arthington and in gbarnga , liberia 's second city .
mr chea told the bbc that government forces had now cut off the rebels ' retreat on the main highway to gbarnga , and were attacking them from three different locations .
" we have managed to keep them in , and this time they are going to pay a heavy price for coming in to central liberia , " he said .
charles taylor declared a state of emergency in february the government has faced an insurgency in northern liberia since mid-2000 , and in recent months lurd rebels have pushed towards monrovia .
there was panic in the capital on monday when artillery fire was heard from arthington , the president 's home town .
children in the capital were taken out of schools and residents prepared to flee as soldiers bristling with rocket-launchers sped out in military vehicles towards the fighting .
president taylor appealed for calm , saying he would not let the city " be placed in a chaotic position " .
army under pressure the rebels are believed to include fighters and politicians from the losing side in liberia 's 1989-96 civil war with at least some support from neighbouring guinea .
thousands have been displaced by the fighting in february , mr taylor declared a state of emergency as the fighting created thousands of refugees .
the liberian army is being hampered by a un arms embargo imposed a year ago to counter mr taylor 's support for sierra leone 's rebel revolutionary united front .
the un security council voted unanimously last week to renew the sanctions , which also include a travel ban on liberia 's leaders and a ban on diamond sales .
a liberian soldier told the bbc that " up to 10 men have to rely on one rifle to fight the rebels " .

with president fidel castro looking on , mr carter said that the united states " should take the first step " towards improving relations between the two countries .
your constitution recognises freedom of speech and association , but other laws deny these freedoms to those who disagree with the government jimmy carter he also urged president castro to allow un human rights commissioner mary robinson to visit cuba and praised a project by cuban dissidents seeking a referendum on broad political and economic reforms .
washington has not yet officially reacted to the speech .
bbc washington correspondent steve kingstone says mr carter could be said to have breached a long-standing political protocol whereby former presidents refrain from criticising the current administration while travelling abroad .
cuban exiles in america welcomed mr carter 's criticism of cuba 's political system .
executive director of the cuban american national foundation , joe garcia , said : " fidel castro had to sit there while he was given a speech on democracy , something the cuban people have not been able to hear for 43 years . "
three-point plan mr carter 's speech - which he made in spanish at havana university on tuesday - was broadcast live and uncensored on cuban tv and radio .
fidel castro strongly denies being involved in biological weaponry it came on the third day of his landmark visit to the island , which has been dominated by a row over us claims that cuba is involved in the development of biological weapons .
the bbc 's ian pannell , in havana , said it was an optimistic and diplomatic speech which gave a three-point plan to improving us-cuba relations .
first , he wanted the us - as the world 's most powerful nation - to take the first step by allowing unrestricted travel and repealing the trade embargo .
our washington correspondent says mr carter 's call for the lifting of the embargo directly contradicts government policy and mr bush wo n't take kindly to being told that america must make the first move if relations with cuba are to improve .
mr carter also said that property disputes between cuba and us firms and cuban exiles should be resolved and suggested cuban exiles could be used to bridge the gap between the two countries .
movement for change mr carter gave his support to moves by dissidents to bring about changes to cuba 's one-party communist system .
my nation is hardly perfect in human rights jimmy carter his mention of the initiative - known as the varela project - was the first time many cubans had learned of the campaign .
organisers of the project have handed in a petition bearing 11,020 signatures to the cuban national assembly asking for a referendum on civil liberties .
the referendum would ask voters if they are in favour of human rights , an amnesty for political prisoners , the right to have own a business and electoral reform .
" when cubans exercise this freedom to change laws peacefully by a direct vote , the world will see that cubans , and not foreigners , will decide the future of this country , " said mr carter .
human rights mr carter also touched on concerns about human rights in cuba .
" cuba has adopted a socialist government where one political party dominates and people are not permitted to organise any opposition movements , " he said .
" your constitution recognises freedom of speech and association , but other laws deny these freedoms to those who disagree with the government . "
he added : " my nation is hardly perfect in human rights .
" a very large number of our citizens are incarcerated in prison and there is little doubt that the death penalty is imposed most harshly on those who are poor , black , or mentally ill , " he said . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's ian pannell in havana " what jimmy carter has done in havana is set out a roadmap to normal relations " talking point cold thaw is it time to lift the embargo against cuba ?

with president fidel castro looking on , mr carter said that the united states " should take the first step " towards improving relations between the two countries . "
your constitution recognises freedom of speech and association , but other laws deny these freedoms to those who disagree with the government " jimmy carter he also urged president castro to allow un human rights commissioner mary robinson to visit cuba and praised a project by cuban dissidents seeking a referendum on broad political and economic reforms .
washington has not yet officially reacted to the speech .
bbc washington correspondent steve kingstone says mr carter could be said to have breached a long-standing political protocol whereby former presidents refrain from criticising the current administration while travelling abroad .
cuban exiles in america welcomed mr carter 's criticism of cuba 's political system .
executive director of the cuban american national foundation , joe garcia , said : " fidel castro had to sit there while he was given a speech on democracy , something the cuban people have not been able to hear for 43 years . "
three-point plan mr carter 's speech - which he made in spanish at havana university on tuesday - was broadcast live and uncensored on cuban tv and radio .
it came on the third day of his landmark visit to the island , which has been dominated by a row over us claims that cuba is involved in the development of biological weapons .
the bbc 's ian pannell , in havana , said it was an optimistic and diplomatic speech which gave a three-point plan to improving us-cuba relations .
first , he wanted the us - as the world 's most powerful nation - to take the first step by allowing unrestricted travel and repealing the trade embargo .
our washington correspondent says mr carter 's call for the lifting of the embargo directly contradicts government policy and mr bush wo n't take kindly to being told that america must make the first move if relations with cuba are to improve .
mr carter also said that property disputes between cuba and us firms and cuban exiles should be resolved and suggested cuban exiles could be used to bridge the gap between the two countries .
movement for change mr carter gave his support to moves by dissidents to bring about changes to cuba 's one-party communist system . "
my nation is hardly perfect in human rights " jimmy carter his mention of the initiative - known as the varela project - was the first time many cubans had learned of the campaign .
organisers of the project have handed in a petition bearing 11,020 signatures to the cuban national assembly asking for a referendum on civil liberties .
the referendum would ask voters if they are in favour of human rights , an amnesty for political prisoners , the right to have own a business and electoral reform .
" when cubans exercise this freedom to change laws peacefully by a direct vote , the world will see that cubans , and not foreigners , will decide the future of this country , " said mr carter .
human rights mr carter also touched on concerns about human rights in cuba .
" cuba has adopted a socialist government where one political party dominates and people are not permitted to organise any opposition movements , " he said .
" your constitution recognises freedom of speech and association , but other laws deny these freedoms to those who disagree with the government . "
he added : " my nation is hardly perfect in human rights .
" a very large number of our citizens are incarcerated in prison and there is little doubt that the death penalty is imposed most harshly on those who are poor , black , or mentally ill , " he said .

mr mrksic faces the more serious charges .
he is accused of crimes against humanity for the alleged killing of at least 200 non-serbs near the croatian city of vukovar in 1991 .
mr martic is accused of ordering the shelling of the croatian capital zagreb in 1995 , in which at least seven civilians were killed .

the office for national statistics -lrb- ons -rrb- said the number of benefit claimants in april rose by 5,400 from march to a total of 953,000 .
the rise in the claimant count wrong-footed predictions of a slight decrease , with most economists forecasting a fall of about 3,000 .
the monthly increase - the second so far this year - suggests that the uk labour market is softening , raising questions over the strength of the economic recovery .
underlying strength however , the uk 's minister for work nick brown said the jobs market remained fundamentally strong , with historically high numbers of people in employment .
" at a time when other countries have experienced greater difficulty , this demonstrates the resilience and hard-won stability of the british economy and labour market , " he said in a statement .
the uk unemployment rate is still only slightly above a low last seen in 1976 .
high rates of employment are critical to the uk 's overall economic health , with consumer spending accounting for about two thirds of all economic activity .
the uk economy 's capacity to keep on creating jobs during last year 's downturn was a major factor in staving off a full-blown recession .
the unemployment rate by claimant count for april was unchanged from march at 3.2 % , ons said .
the international labour organisation unemployment rate - which includes those out of work but not claiming benefit - was 5.1 % .
wage pressures separate ons data showed that average salaries were 4.4 % higher last month compared with april 2001 , in a sign that inflationary pressures are still present in the economy .
however , the increase came in below the 4.5 % threshold which the bank of england believes is the maximum level compatible with low inflation .
" the underlying message is that market conditions are still historically tight but that overall wage cost pressures remain contained , " said jeremy hawkins , chief economist at the bank of america .
moderate wage growth makes it less likely that the bank of england will raise interest rates from their current 37-year low of 4 % at its next monthly meeting .
the bank slashed borrowing costs by two percentage points in an attempt at warding off recession last year .
but most economists expect that with economic growth now showing signs of picking up , the next move in interest rates will be upwards .

three more cases have been reported since police set up a telephone hotline on 6 may .
it followed allegations that as many as six priests in hong kong abused children in cases going back several decades .
one priest was detained last week for questioning .
superintendent shirley chu told reporters the three new cases allegedly took place in the 1960s and 1970s and involved boys studying at secondary schools .
the allegations come as the roman catholic church worldwide grapples with accusations that it covered up abuse by priests .
the biggest scandal broke in the united states where cases of abuse have come to light in at least 17 dioceses .
pope john paul ii has said there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young .
public anger since the hong kong allegations broke , church officials there have referred serious cases to the police , saying they are adopting a " zero tolerance " policy toward sexual abuse of children .
however the bbc 's damian grammaticas in hong kong says the church has been criticised for not publicly acknowledging cases of paedophilia much sooner .
the church 's admission earlier this month that some priests were under suspicion in hong kong came only after allegations appeared in the south china morning post - the chinese territory 's english-language daily .
the priest who was questioned last week , michael lau , was arrested on 4 may but was released the next day on bail .
no charges have been filed yet .
the priest was defrocked after the church found in an internal investigation that he had sexually molested a 15-year-old boy twice in 1994 , but church officials did not report the case to police .
the church had said earlier that one of the cases took place in another country before the priest was transferred to hong kong and that at least two of the other accused priests have moved away , one to canada and one to australia .
there are about a quarter of a million catholics in hong kong and the church runs more than 300 schools and nurseries .
about 300 priests work in the former british colony .
