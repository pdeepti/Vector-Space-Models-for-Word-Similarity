who will pay for it is another question . a decade-long debate came to an end wednesday when an international commission voted to rebuild the palace of the prussian kings in berlin .
the 15-member commission was the second body to approve the reconstruction of the baroque palace - be it in an altered form .
but the debate looks to continue .
in its decision , the commission narrowly voted to use the original baroque facade , which remained even after the communist east german government dynamited the building 's remains in 1950 .
several prominent politicians , among them germany 's culture minister and berlin 's mayor are against the use of the original facade .
culture minister julian nida-rümelin argued the facade of the berlin palace was never one of the most significant examples of baroque architecture in germany .
he would have preferred holding a competition among international architects for the right solution .
who will pick up the check ?
berlin mayor klaus wowereit is also against the facade .
but he has other concerns .
his city is 40 billion euro in debt .
swimming pools are closing and the city 's police have already lost their helicopter and are looking at getting their gas money cut significantly as well .
paying even some of the estimated 670 million euro bill for an 18th century palace is out of the question .
" otherwise , " said wowereit .
" we would be discussing this for the next 10 years . "
baroque palace over a communist relic wednesday 's decision means the death knell for the modernistic " palace of the republic , " east germany 's monument to itself . following the almost total destruction of the palace in wwii , the communist government forgoed a rebuild attempt , preferring to blow up the remains of a building they believed symbolized germany 's feudalistic past .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " palace of the republic " in its place , they built a building of glass , marble and steel , which housed the east german parliament , cafés and restaurants .
over the years , it became popular with many east-berliners and an integral part of east german identity .
but after german reunification in 1990 , scientists discovered that the " palace of the republic " was contaminated with cancer-causing asbestos and closed the building down .
for the past eleven years it 's been sitting unused .
it 's seriously deteriorated and has become an eye-sore in the heart of berlin .
the reconstructed prussian palace is due to house cultural and scientific institutions .
the layout inside will be modern , the facade baroque .
" the architecture will continue to be debated , " said commission head hannes swoboda in addressing the facade controversy .
" even after its built . "
swoboda , once a member of vienna 's architectural council , said the experts had n't been guided by nostalgia .
rather , the facade would just fit better in an area which already houses a number of architectural landmarks .
just across from the palace is berlin 's historical museum complex museumsinsel , which was dedicated an un cultural heritage site .
and next to the palace are other historical buildings dating back to prussian times . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : re-building berlin 's royal palace berlin was largely destroyed during world war ii .

bbc news -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- parkinson 's brain renewal advance categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : sci / tech front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 18 april , 2002 , 04:10 gmt 05:10 uk parkinson 's brain renewal advance roger nelson -lrb- right -rrb- has shown dramatic improvements by pallab ghosh bbc science correspondent doctors in bristol , uk , have developed an experimental treatment which , they suspect , has regenerated the brains of five patients with parkinson 's disease .
i burst out laughing , which i had n't been able to do for several years roger nelson one patient has learned to laugh again and has regained his sense of smell .
the doctors say it is too soon to tell whether the treatment is long lasting or could be used on all sufferers of parkinson 's .
but they have been astonished at how effective the treatment has been so far .
the treatment involves putting a drug called gdnf -lrb- glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor -rrb- into a mechanical pump , two of which feed it to the most damaged parts of the brain .
mr gill and colleagues were surprised at the results " we can deliver a drug very precisely to areas in the brain in the concentrations that we need to cause recovery and we can control that very precisely , " said stephen gill , consultant neurosurgeon at frenchay hospital .
he said he and his colleagues were very surprised at the effects of the treatment .
rapid progress " we thought that this drug would take some months or years to be effective -lsb- but -rsb- we found that really within a month or two patients were noticing significant changes . "
two pumps in mr nelson 's body feed the drug to his brain patients with parkinson 's disease lose their sense of smell and taste but this recovered very early , he said .
roger nelson , who took part in the bristol trial , told the bbc what the treatment had meant for him .
" being able to talk better , walk better , smile and also laugh again .
" my wife passed a slightly risque comment just after i got home from hospital and i burst out laughing , which i had n't been able to do for several years , " he said .
further research nik patel , consultant neurosurgeon at frenchay hospital , counsels caution .
the treatment targets degenerated brain areas " i think we 're a way from a possible cure yet and we have many hurdles to cross and many theories to prove but that remains a possibility .
" we have to prove that this drug is continually effective , safe and does reverse the disease , and in time we may see the results on a pet -lrb- positron emission tomography -rrb- scan confirming these cells have re-grown , " he told the bbc .
the new treatment has worked well on five people - but that is too few to know for sure whether it is an effective therapy .
but the results so far are promising and it has given roger a new lease of life .

after meeting senior members of congress in washington , mr pastrana said colombia needed to use military equipment for operations against left-wing rebels , whom he described as narco-terrorists . "

but a bbc correspondent in washington says members of congress have previously voiced concern about the suspected links between the drugs trade , right-wing paramilitaries and elements within the colombian armed forces .
they fear us military aid might end up in the wrong hands .
mr pastrana is due to meet president bush at the white house on thursday .
colombia 's decades-long conflict has escalated since 20 february when mr pastrana 's government broke off peace talks with the country 's main rebel group , the farc .
negotiations with the second-largest insurgency , the national liberation army -lrb- eln -rrb- , are still under way .
us qualms as the country suffers a wave of rebel bombings , the colombians are trying to establish their country as another front in the war on terrorism , says the bbc 's bogota correspondent jeremy mcdermott .
president pastrana has likened colombia 's struggle to that of the us against al-qaeda and has pointed to a recent rash of rebel car bombings which have killed dozens of civilians in the last month to prove his point .
he wants the restrictions on $ 1bn of us military aid granted by former president bill clinton lifted , so that it can be used to contain the latest guerrilla offensive .
but the us congress has reservations , and there is the shadow of vietnam hanging over the american psyche .
there are fears that further commitment in colombia could drag america into the 40-year civil conflict .

the lawyer , raoul felder , made the claim in court in manhattan , where the former mayor 's divorce case is once again making headlines .
it dominated new york tabloid newspapers and talk shows before the 11 september attacks on the city which made mr giuliani into a household name around the world .
he became the only mayor in the city 's history to have to move out of the mayoral mansion because of his domestic difficulties .
mr giuliani 's estranged wife , - the actress donna hanover - had been granted a court ruling that his new companion , judith nathan , could n't stay in the mansion , while she and their two children were living there .
' fair ' figure now , the divorce case is back in court and in the headlines .
donna hanover 's lawyer says the $ 1m a year settlement she is seeking from the former mayor is fair , as he is now earning that much every month , with speaking engagements and his new management consultancy business .
if the couple have not settled by june , the divorce will go to trial , with what has been already a very acrimonious case , then out in public view .
it is not likely to do much for rudoplh giuliani 's reputation .
he was named man of the year , and his popularity soared after the attacks on the world trade center .
but now , a new opinion poll says only 10 % of americans would like to see him run for public office again .

only one in 25 theatre staff are from ethnic minorities , says the eclipse report , with a " distinct lack " of black and asian workers .
the report was commissioned by the arts council of england and the theatrical management association -lrb- tma -rrb- .
it was a matter of major concern that people from minority backgrounds were rarely in positions of management , the report said .

and of the 463 board members of uk theatres , just 13 were non-white .

the report was commissioned following the 1999 macpherson report into the death of teenager stephen lawrence , which drew attention to institutional racism .
the theatre industry took a long look at itself and realised it was not encouraging ethnic minorities into the profession .
" the aim of the eclipse report is to change the mindset and artistic theatre practice to reflect the diverse society of england in the 21st century , " added mr hewitt .
action plans " the imperative to conquer institutional racism and to embrace and celebrate the diversity of the world 's cultures has never been more acute , especially after the events of 2001 . "
the report recommends financial investment to change the culture of the industry .
a review of equal opportunities policies and " positive action plans " to develop opportunities for black and asian people in the theatre should be also implemented by senior staff , it said .
the report also recommends an independent group be set up to monitor progress .
maggie saxon , president of the tma and managing director of the west yorkshire playhouse , said the report would bring very important results .

the report calls for more to be done to improve cleanliness and sanitation at swansea prison , particularly for vulnerable inmates who are housed away from other prisoners .
the jail 's b wing has been closed however , staff have won praise for their efforts in rehabilitating offenders .
the jail has recently had problems housing some of its inmates .
just over a year ago 87 inmates had to be transferred after traces of asbestos were found in the heating system .
and the prison 's b wing has been closed down completely , condemned as unsafe to house prisoners .
the latest report commends improvements made by the prison 's governor but said more needed to be done to modernise conditions , especially where segregated inmates are held .
the inspection - which was unannounced -was carried out in july 2001 at the prison which currently houses around 350 inmates .
inspectors said it was unacceptable that prisoners in cells in the underground section of the jail , which houses vulnerable and segregated prisoners , do not have toilets .
it means inmates have to call on staff during the night to let them out to use other facilities .
the jail 's education programme has been praised they also criticised the lack of showers in all areas which means that not all inmates are able to shower every day .
parts of the prison are described as " grubby " in the report , and the inspectors called for cleanliness standards to be improved as well as more furniture , blankets and pillows to be provided in cells .
the inspectors were positive about the standard of education for inmates , and the efforts made to give offenders very basic skills as part of their rehabilitation .
segregated prisoners but there was criticism of the way segregated prisoners are served , with very limited resources being made available to them .
the report concludes not enough is being done to put new inmates through an induction programme , and to plan out their sentence .
also , at the time of the inspection , the report said insufficient monitoring of bullying was being carried out .
however , governor vicky o 'dea said a wide ranging anti-bullying strategy has since been implemented . watch / listen on this story bbc wales 's hywel griffith " swansea prison is a victorian institution struggling to meet modern standards " see also : 01 sep 01 -pipe- wales inquiry into custody death 30 apr 01 -pipe- wales police guilty of neglect in cell death 15 mar 01 -pipe- wales police attacked for cell death ' neglect ' 12 mar 01 -pipe- wales inquest opens into cell death 01 jul 01 -pipe- wales inquiry after death in custody 18 feb 00 -pipe- wales couple 's prison sex inquiry internet links : hm prison service prison officers ' association the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : soap actor killed in holiday fall wales leads uk bust firms league husband jailed for rape attack festival town prepares for euros plea for more kidney donors rowing team arrives back in uk families opt for single jabs hain turns fire on greens links to more wales stories are at the foot of the page .
