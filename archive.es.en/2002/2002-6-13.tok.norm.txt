german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .
" effectively combating terror must be in the foreground , but it 's well understood in the united states that constitutional norms must be respected , " schröder said .

he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .
on wednesday , gew called a demonstration in berlin .
30,000 teachers and educators took to the streets of the german capital , demanding a reform of the country 's education system .
the head of gew , eva-maria stange , voiced strong support for the chancellor 's plans to strengthen the education sector .
she criticized plans of the german federal states , or länder , to cut back on education .
the berlin demonstration marked the start of a country-wide gew campaign called " save education " .
over the next few weeks , gew and the federal german parents association bundeselternrat -lrb- ber -rrb- will be highlighting the miserable state of the german education system through posters , discussions and demonstrations across the country .
education for export since germany is a country low in natural resources , the only thing the country can export is high quality products and technical know-how .
and that 's what makes education and training vitally important for germany : the country will only be able to succeed in a globalized world economy in the future if german workers , engineers and scientists maintain their high level of training and efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in germany most germans are aware of the fact that the country can only keep its edge on the competition through good training .
that 's why germans were shocked earlier this year , when an international study revealed that students here were lagging far behind school kids in other countries in basic skills like reading and mathematics .
german students finished far behind schoolchildren from finland , spain , italy and the u.s. up to then , germans had been proud of their education system , thinking it one of the best in the world .
but the international " pisa " test , in which the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- compared students in 32 countries , shocked the germans out of their complacency .

he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .

all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .
" effectively combating terror must be in the foreground , but it 's well understood in the united states that constitutional norms must be respected , " schröder said .
france has also said it will withhold evidence relating to moussaoui if the u.s. does not agree to set aside the possiblity of the death penalty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe and america take stock unlimited solidarity has turned to wary support in the transatlantic relationship , as a host of thorny economic and politic issues strain relations between europe and the us .

a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .

u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .

now , the tiny east german town is hoping the crumbling complex can recapture its old allure - and profits . it is the perfect backdrop for a fairytale .
standing in a grove of beech trees , on the shore of a smooth , grey lake stands a large , half-timbered villa .
mist shrouds its blackened roof .
this building , which lies on the zenssee in hohenlychen , less than an hour ’ s drive from berlin , has sunk into the mists of oblivion .
ingo lück leads the way through an iron gate , legacy of the russian army , decorated with a bright red star .
the hobby historian and hohenlychen enthusiast is one of the few locals to set foot here on a regular basis .
discarded by its last inhabitants , the russian army , and misused by the nazis , locals tend to avoid this secluded spot in brandenburg ’ s woods .
beyond the gate , several large , greying buildings stand forlorn and dilapidated in the drizzling rain .
lück points out turrets , stained glass windows , arched doorways .
they were designed , he explains , a century ago to please the children of affluent north germans , and were made to look like small castles .
what is left today of the former children ’ s sanatorium is a cluster of large villas , with crumbling turrets , bordered up bay windows and overgrown , unkempt gardens .
even today , with its breathtaking view , historic flair , numerous glass fronts and huge balconies , the former sanatorium would make the perfect setting for a place to relax and recuperate .
it would also bring a welcome boost to a depressed east german town facing 30 per cent unemployment .
hohenlychen ’ s mayor evelyn wienold sighs .
" lychen isn ’ t as chic as the baltic seaside resorts " she says – referring to those former east german coastal towns newly renovated and still gleaming in fresh paint .
" we just don ’ t have the cafes , the restaurants and the shops to attract visitors " .
there was a time things were different .
from children ’ s home to top recuperation destination built by the berlin red cross in 1902 as an alternative to sanatoriums in switzerland for children suffering from tuberculosis , it soon evolved into a leading health and relaxation destination .
by the 1930s the " märkische interlaken " - the northern equivalent to the popular holiday resort in the alps - had gained worldwide recognition .
" jesse owens , king george iv , max schmeling , the japanese emperor " all stayed at hohenlychen , says lück , listing the names as he treads his way across threadbare floorboards and broken tiles , his footsteps crunching on shattered glass .
" those were the days when the sanatorium was hohenlychen ’ s main bread-winner " , he explains .
the complex not only employed gardners , maids and nurses , its good reputation also supported the local hotel industry .
the sanatorium itself employed up to 400 people , about 400,000 in need of recuperation stayed in the tiny village at the best of times .
" the sanatorium was a motor for trade in the area " , mayor wienold says . trying to close a horrific chapter by the mid 1930s , the sanatorium ’ s reputation began to change for the worse .
with the 1936 olympics in mind , top nazi doctor prof. dr. karl gebhardt built up a new clinic for sport medicine at the sanatorium , complete with swimming pool , sports hall , arena and massage benches .
during his position as top doctor at the sanatorium , gebhardt ’ s deputies conducted experiments using sulfanomid , a possible remedy to war injuries .
the chosen guinea-pigs were mostly women , prisoners at the nearby konzentrationslager ravensbrück .
their legs cut open and deliberately infected with bacteria , wood shavings and glass splitters , the men and women suffered indescribable pain and excruciating deaths .
furthermore , gebhardt carried out more experiments in plastic surgery , such as the extraction of a prisoner ’ s shoulder-bone and replacing it in a young soldier ’ s body .
it is still contended whether some of these operations actually took place at hohenlychen , which by then had an extraordinarily well-equipped operation room and the latest in medicinal technology .
gebhardt , later sentenced to death in nuremberg , was said to have never performed experiments himself , transferring the responsibility to the doctors at ravensbrück .
" everyone immediately links hohenlychen to gebhardt ’ s experiments " , lück says , with resignation in his voice .
" but the experiments themselves all took place at the concentration camp . "
opening a narrow door to to a former physiotherapy room , lück explains how four time gold medalist jesse owens had a knee operation at the sanatorium during the 1936 olympics .
the fact that the black american was treated here is an important one for lück and the rest of the village .
" we do not deny gebhardt ’ s responsibility " , he says .
but it is the constant connection between the sanatorium and the makings of one treacherous doctor which is clearly regretted by the village .
a common , yet unique obstacle " it is not the sanatorium ’ s past which discourages potential investors " , dr. roland schneider , monument protection commissioner at brandenburg ’ s building ministry claims .
the reasons he says , are manifold .
hohenlychen is faced with a problem common to villages , towns and cities across eastern germany : vacancy .
a shrinking economy , a rise in unemployment , plus an exodus of 1 million looking for better job opportunities and higher wages in the west since reunification , has led to a 13 per cent level of both urban , and rural vacancy in eastern germany , including a large number of old buildings under monument protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one million apartments in east german high-rise apartment blocks – the hallmark of the former gdr – stand empty , the state of vacant old buildings , such as the former sanatorium in hohenlychen , easily fall short of public awareness .
as a result , getting public funding is no easy task .
the sanatorium ’ s rural location makes it easy to get overlooked by programs such as " rebuilding east " a 2 billion euro federal aid package that aims to revitalize former east german cities .
the sanatorium ’ s unique layout also poses a problem , concedes schneider .
it is almost impossible to find one investor to purchase the 10 buildings spread across 15 hectares of land .
" we are therefore looking for several , separate investors , " he says .
a ray of hope today , there is new hope for the small village and its troubled sanatorium .
a southern german company has bought one of the larger buildings and plans to turn it into a home for the elderly later this year .
though the company plans a tedious renovation of the building and its immediate surroundings , the other buildings remain an eyesore .
on the way out , lück points to a small building , which lück explains , was one of the very first .
" just look at the turrets , the timberwork , the stained glass – perfect for a child ’ s fairytale " .
as in a fairytale , the sanatorium has its own gruesome and chilling chapter .

now , the tiny east german town is hoping the crumbling complex can recapture its old allure - and profits . it is the perfect backdrop for a fairytale .
standing in a grove of beech trees , on the shore of a smooth , grey lake stands a large , half-timbered villa .
mist shrouds its blackened roof .
this building , which lies on the zenssee in hohenlychen , less than an hour ’ s drive from berlin , has sunk into the mists of oblivion .
ingo lück leads the way through an iron gate , legacy of the russian army , decorated with a bright red star .
the hobby historian and hohenlychen enthusiast is one of the few locals to set foot here on a regular basis .
discarded by its last inhabitants , the russian army , and misused by the nazis , locals tend to avoid this secluded spot in brandenburg ’ s woods .
beyond the gate , several large , greying buildings stand forlorn and dilapidated in the drizzling rain .
lück points out turrets , stained glass windows , arched doorways .
they were designed , he explains , a century ago to please the children of affluent north germans , and were made to look like small castles .
what is left today of the former children ’ s sanatorium is a cluster of large villas , with crumbling turrets , bordered up bay windows and overgrown , unkempt gardens .
even today , with its breathtaking view , historic flair , numerous glass fronts and huge balconies , the former sanatorium would make the perfect setting for a place to relax and recuperate .
it would also bring a welcome boost to a depressed east german town facing 30 per cent unemployment .
hohenlychen ’ s mayor evelyn wienold sighs .
" lychen isn ’ t as chic as the baltic seaside resorts " she says – referring to those former east german coastal towns newly renovated and still gleaming in fresh paint .
" we just don ’ t have the cafes , the restaurants and the shops to attract visitors " .
there was a time things were different .
from children ’ s home to top recuperation destination built by the berlin red cross in 1902 as an alternative to sanatoriums in switzerland for children suffering from tuberculosis , it soon evolved into a leading health and relaxation destination .
by the 1930s the " märkische interlaken " - the northern equivalent to the popular holiday resort in the alps - had gained worldwide recognition .
" jesse owens , king george iv , max schmeling , the japanese emperor " all stayed at hohenlychen , says lück , listing the names as he treads his way across threadbare floorboards and broken tiles , his footsteps crunching on shattered glass .
" those were the days when the sanatorium was hohenlychen ’ s main bread-winner " , he explains .
the complex not only employed gardners , maids and nurses , its good reputation also supported the local hotel industry .
the sanatorium itself employed up to 400 people , about 400,000 in need of recuperation stayed in the tiny village at the best of times .
" the sanatorium was a motor for trade in the area " , mayor wienold says . trying to close a horrific chapter by the mid 1930s , the sanatorium ’ s reputation began to change for the worse .
with the 1936 olympics in mind , top nazi doctor prof. dr. karl gebhardt built up a new clinic for sport medicine at the sanatorium , complete with swimming pool , sports hall , arena and massage benches .
during his position as top doctor at the sanatorium , gebhardt ’ s deputies conducted experiments using sulfanomid , a possible remedy to war injuries .
the chosen guinea-pigs were mostly women , prisoners at the nearby konzentrationslager ravensbrück .
their legs cut open and deliberately infected with bacteria , wood shavings and glass splitters , the men and women suffered indescribable pain and excruciating deaths .
furthermore , gebhardt carried out more experiments in plastic surgery , such as the extraction of a prisoner ’ s shoulder-bone and replacing it in a young soldier ’ s body .
it is still contended whether some of these operations actually took place at hohenlychen , which by then had an extraordinarily well-equipped operation room and the latest in medicinal technology .
gebhardt , later sentenced to death in nuremberg , was said to have never performed experiments himself , transferring the responsibility to the doctors at ravensbrück .
" everyone immediately links hohenlychen to gebhardt ’ s experiments " , lück says , with resignation in his voice .
" but the experiments themselves all took place at the concentration camp . "
opening a narrow door to to a former physiotherapy room , lück explains how four time gold medalist jesse owens had a knee operation at the sanatorium during the 1936 olympics .
the fact that the black american was treated here is an important one for lück and the rest of the village .
" we do not deny gebhardt ’ s responsibility " , he says .
but it is the constant connection between the sanatorium and the makings of one treacherous doctor which is clearly regretted by the village .
a common , yet unique obstacle " it is not the sanatorium ’ s past which discourages potential investors " , dr. roland schneider , monument protection commissioner at brandenburg ’ s building ministry claims .
the reasons he says , are manifold .
hohenlychen is faced with a problem common to villages , towns and cities across eastern germany : vacancy .
a shrinking economy , a rise in unemployment , plus an exodus of 1 million looking for better job opportunities and higher wages in the west since reunification , has led to a 13 per cent level of both urban , and rural vacancy in eastern germany , including a large number of old buildings under monument protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one million apartments in east german high-rise apartment blocks – the hallmark of the former gdr – stand empty , the state of vacant old buildings , such as the former sanatorium in hohenlychen , easily fall short of public awareness .
as a result , getting public funding is no easy task .
the sanatorium ’ s rural location makes it easy to get overlooked by programs such as " rebuilding east " a 2 billion euro federal aid package that aims to revitalize former east german cities .
the sanatorium ’ s unique layout also poses a problem , concedes schneider .
it is almost impossible to find one investor to purchase the 10 buildings spread across 15 hectares of land .
" we are therefore looking for several , separate investors , " he says .
a ray of hope today , there is new hope for the small village and its troubled sanatorium .
a southern german company has bought one of the larger buildings and plans to turn it into a home for the elderly later this year .
though the company plans a tedious renovation of the building and its immediate surroundings , the other buildings remain an eyesore .
on the way out , lück points to a small building , which lück explains , was one of the very first .
" just look at the turrets , the timberwork , the stained glass – perfect for a child ’ s fairytale " .
as in a fairytale , the sanatorium has its own gruesome and chilling chapter .

hohenlychen is faced with a problem common to villages , towns and cities across eastern germany : vacancy .
a shrinking economy , a rise in unemployment , plus an exodus of 1 million looking for better job opportunities and higher wages in the west since reunification , has led to a 13 per cent level of both urban , and rural vacancy in eastern germany , including a large number of old buildings under monument protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one million apartments in east german high-rise apartment blocks – the hallmark of the former gdr – stand empty , the state of vacant old buildings , such as the former sanatorium in hohenlychen , easily fall short of public awareness .
as a result , getting public funding is no easy task .
the sanatorium ’ s rural location makes it easy to get overlooked by programs such as " rebuilding east " a 2 billion euro federal aid package that aims to revitalize former east german cities .
the sanatorium ’ s unique layout also poses a problem , concedes schneider .
it is almost impossible to find one investor to purchase the 10 buildings spread across 15 hectares of land .
" we are therefore looking for several , separate investors , " he says .

now , the tiny east german town is hoping the crumbling complex can recapture its old allure - and profits . it is the perfect backdrop for a fairytale .
standing in a grove of beech trees , on the shore of a smooth , grey lake stands a large , half-timbered villa .
mist shrouds its blackened roof .
this building , which lies on the zenssee in hohenlychen , less than an hour ’ s drive from berlin , has sunk into the mists of oblivion .
ingo lück leads the way through an iron gate , legacy of the russian army , decorated with a bright red star .
the hobby historian and hohenlychen enthusiast is one of the few locals to set foot here on a regular basis .
discarded by its last inhabitants , the russian army , and misused by the nazis , locals tend to avoid this secluded spot in brandenburg ’ s woods .
beyond the gate , several large , greying buildings stand forlorn and dilapidated in the drizzling rain .
lück points out turrets , stained glass windows , arched doorways .
they were designed , he explains , a century ago to please the children of affluent north germans , and were made to look like small castles .
what is left today of the former children ’ s sanatorium is a cluster of large villas , with crumbling turrets , bordered up bay windows and overgrown , unkempt gardens .
even today , with its breathtaking view , historic flair , numerous glass fronts and huge balconies , the former sanatorium would make the perfect setting for a place to relax and recuperate .
it would also bring a welcome boost to a depressed east german town facing 30 per cent unemployment .
hohenlychen ’ s mayor evelyn wienold sighs .
" lychen isn ’ t as chic as the baltic seaside resorts " she says – referring to those former east german coastal towns newly renovated and still gleaming in fresh paint .
" we just don ’ t have the cafes , the restaurants and the shops to attract visitors " .
there was a time things were different .
from children ’ s home to top recuperation destination built by the berlin red cross in 1902 as an alternative to sanatoriums in switzerland for children suffering from tuberculosis , it soon evolved into a leading health and relaxation destination .
by the 1930s the " märkische interlaken " - the northern equivalent to the popular holiday resort in the alps - had gained worldwide recognition .
" jesse owens , king george iv , max schmeling , the japanese emperor " all stayed at hohenlychen , says lück , listing the names as he treads his way across threadbare floorboards and broken tiles , his footsteps crunching on shattered glass .
" those were the days when the sanatorium was hohenlychen ’ s main bread-winner " , he explains .
the complex not only employed gardners , maids and nurses , its good reputation also supported the local hotel industry .
the sanatorium itself employed up to 400 people , about 400,000 in need of recuperation stayed in the tiny village at the best of times .
" the sanatorium was a motor for trade in the area " , mayor wienold says . trying to close a horrific chapter by the mid 1930s , the sanatorium ’ s reputation began to change for the worse .
with the 1936 olympics in mind , top nazi doctor prof. dr. karl gebhardt built up a new clinic for sport medicine at the sanatorium , complete with swimming pool , sports hall , arena and massage benches .
during his position as top doctor at the sanatorium , gebhardt ’ s deputies conducted experiments using sulfanomid , a possible remedy to war injuries .
the chosen guinea-pigs were mostly women , prisoners at the nearby konzentrationslager ravensbrück .
their legs cut open and deliberately infected with bacteria , wood shavings and glass splitters , the men and women suffered indescribable pain and excruciating deaths .
furthermore , gebhardt carried out more experiments in plastic surgery , such as the extraction of a prisoner ’ s shoulder-bone and replacing it in a young soldier ’ s body .
it is still contended whether some of these operations actually took place at hohenlychen , which by then had an extraordinarily well-equipped operation room and the latest in medicinal technology .
gebhardt , later sentenced to death in nuremberg , was said to have never performed experiments himself , transferring the responsibility to the doctors at ravensbrück .
" everyone immediately links hohenlychen to gebhardt ’ s experiments " , lück says , with resignation in his voice .
" but the experiments themselves all took place at the concentration camp . "

now , the tiny east german town is hoping the crumbling complex can recapture its old allure - and profits . it is the perfect backdrop for a fairytale .
standing in a grove of beech trees , on the shore of a smooth , grey lake stands a large , half-timbered villa .
mist shrouds its blackened roof .
this building , which lies on the zenssee in hohenlychen , less than an hour ’ s drive from berlin , has sunk into the mists of oblivion .
ingo lück leads the way through an iron gate , legacy of the russian army , decorated with a bright red star .
the hobby historian and hohenlychen enthusiast is one of the few locals to set foot here on a regular basis .
discarded by its last inhabitants , the russian army , and misused by the nazis , locals tend to avoid this secluded spot in brandenburg ’ s woods .
beyond the gate , several large , greying buildings stand forlorn and dilapidated in the drizzling rain .
lück points out turrets , stained glass windows , arched doorways .
they were designed , he explains , a century ago to please the children of affluent north germans , and were made to look like small castles .
what is left today of the former children ’ s sanatorium is a cluster of large villas , with crumbling turrets , bordered up bay windows and overgrown , unkempt gardens .
even today , with its breathtaking view , historic flair , numerous glass fronts and huge balconies , the former sanatorium would make the perfect setting for a place to relax and recuperate .
it would also bring a welcome boost to a depressed east german town facing 30 per cent unemployment .
hohenlychen ’ s mayor evelyn wienold sighs .
" lychen isn ’ t as chic as the baltic seaside resorts " she says – referring to those former east german coastal towns newly renovated and still gleaming in fresh paint .
" we just don ’ t have the cafes , the restaurants and the shops to attract visitors " .
there was a time things were different .
from children ’ s home to top recuperation destination built by the berlin red cross in 1902 as an alternative to sanatoriums in switzerland for children suffering from tuberculosis , it soon evolved into a leading health and relaxation destination .
by the 1930s the " märkische interlaken " - the northern equivalent to the popular holiday resort in the alps - had gained worldwide recognition .
" jesse owens , king george iv , max schmeling , the japanese emperor " all stayed at hohenlychen , says lück , listing the names as he treads his way across threadbare floorboards and broken tiles , his footsteps crunching on shattered glass .
" those were the days when the sanatorium was hohenlychen ’ s main bread-winner " , he explains .
the complex not only employed gardners , maids and nurses , its good reputation also supported the local hotel industry .
the sanatorium itself employed up to 400 people , about 400,000 in need of recuperation stayed in the tiny village at the best of times .
" the sanatorium was a motor for trade in the area " , mayor wienold says . trying to close a horrific chapter by the mid 1930s , the sanatorium ’ s reputation began to change for the worse .
with the 1936 olympics in mind , top nazi doctor prof. dr. karl gebhardt built up a new clinic for sport medicine at the sanatorium , complete with swimming pool , sports hall , arena and massage benches .
during his position as top doctor at the sanatorium , gebhardt ’ s deputies conducted experiments using sulfanomid , a possible remedy to war injuries .
the chosen guinea-pigs were mostly women , prisoners at the nearby konzentrationslager ravensbrück .
their legs cut open and deliberately infected with bacteria , wood shavings and glass splitters , the men and women suffered indescribable pain and excruciating deaths .
furthermore , gebhardt carried out more experiments in plastic surgery , such as the extraction of a prisoner ’ s shoulder-bone and replacing it in a young soldier ’ s body .
it is still contended whether some of these operations actually took place at hohenlychen , which by then had an extraordinarily well-equipped operation room and the latest in medicinal technology .
gebhardt , later sentenced to death in nuremberg , was said to have never performed experiments himself , transferring the responsibility to the doctors at ravensbrück .
" everyone immediately links hohenlychen to gebhardt ’ s experiments " , lück says , with resignation in his voice .
" but the experiments themselves all took place at the concentration camp . "
opening a narrow door to to a former physiotherapy room , lück explains how four time gold medalist jesse owens had a knee operation at the sanatorium during the 1936 olympics .
the fact that the black american was treated here is an important one for lück and the rest of the village .
" we do not deny gebhardt ’ s responsibility " , he says .
but it is the constant connection between the sanatorium and the makings of one treacherous doctor which is clearly regretted by the village .
a common , yet unique obstacle " it is not the sanatorium ’ s past which discourages potential investors " , dr. roland schneider , monument protection commissioner at brandenburg ’ s building ministry claims .
the reasons he says , are manifold .
hohenlychen is faced with a problem common to villages , towns and cities across eastern germany : vacancy .
a shrinking economy , a rise in unemployment , plus an exodus of 1 million looking for better job opportunities and higher wages in the west since reunification , has led to a 13 per cent level of both urban , and rural vacancy in eastern germany , including a large number of old buildings under monument protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one million apartments in east german high-rise apartment blocks – the hallmark of the former gdr – stand empty , the state of vacant old buildings , such as the former sanatorium in hohenlychen , easily fall short of public awareness .
as a result , getting public funding is no easy task .
the sanatorium ’ s rural location makes it easy to get overlooked by programs such as " rebuilding east " a 2 billion euro federal aid package that aims to revitalize former east german cities .
the sanatorium ’ s unique layout also poses a problem , concedes schneider .
it is almost impossible to find one investor to purchase the 10 buildings spread across 15 hectares of land .
" we are therefore looking for several , separate investors , " he says .
a ray of hope today , there is new hope for the small village and its troubled sanatorium .
a southern german company has bought one of the larger buildings and plans to turn it into a home for the elderly later this year .
though the company plans a tedious renovation of the building and its immediate surroundings , the other buildings remain an eyesore .
on the way out , lück points to a small building , which lück explains , was one of the very first .
" just look at the turrets , the timberwork , the stained glass – perfect for a child ’ s fairytale " .
as in a fairytale , the sanatorium has its own gruesome and chilling chapter .

it is still contended whether some of these operations actually took place at hohenlychen , which by then had an extraordinarily well-equipped operation room and the latest in medicinal technology .
gebhardt , later sentenced to death in nuremberg , was said to have never performed experiments himself , transferring the responsibility to the doctors at ravensbrück .
" everyone immediately links hohenlychen to gebhardt ’ s experiments " , lück says , with resignation in his voice .
" but the experiments themselves all took place at the concentration camp . "
opening a narrow door to to a former physiotherapy room , lück explains how four time gold medalist jesse owens had a knee operation at the sanatorium during the 1936 olympics .
the fact that the black american was treated here is an important one for lück and the rest of the village .
" we do not deny gebhardt ’ s responsibility " , he says .
but it is the constant connection between the sanatorium and the makings of one treacherous doctor which is clearly regretted by the village .
a common , yet unique obstacle " it is not the sanatorium ’ s past which discourages potential investors " , dr. roland schneider , monument protection commissioner at brandenburg ’ s building ministry claims .
the reasons he says , are manifold .
hohenlychen is faced with a problem common to villages , towns and cities across eastern germany : vacancy .
a shrinking economy , a rise in unemployment , plus an exodus of 1 million looking for better job opportunities and higher wages in the west since reunification , has led to a 13 per cent level of both urban , and rural vacancy in eastern germany , including a large number of old buildings under monument protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one million apartments in east german high-rise apartment blocks – the hallmark of the former gdr – stand empty , the state of vacant old buildings , such as the former sanatorium in hohenlychen , easily fall short of public awareness .
as a result , getting public funding is no easy task .
the sanatorium ’ s rural location makes it easy to get overlooked by programs such as " rebuilding east " a 2 billion euro federal aid package that aims to revitalize former east german cities .
the sanatorium ’ s unique layout also poses a problem , concedes schneider .
it is almost impossible to find one investor to purchase the 10 buildings spread across 15 hectares of land .
" we are therefore looking for several , separate investors , " he says .
a ray of hope today , there is new hope for the small village and its troubled sanatorium .
a southern german company has bought one of the larger buildings and plans to turn it into a home for the elderly later this year .
though the company plans a tedious renovation of the building and its immediate surroundings , the other buildings remain an eyesore .
on the way out , lück points to a small building , which lück explains , was one of the very first .
" just look at the turrets , the timberwork , the stained glass – perfect for a child ’ s fairytale " .
as in a fairytale , the sanatorium has its own gruesome and chilling chapter .
still missing , however , is the happy end . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .
" effectively combating terror must be in the foreground , but it 's well understood in the united states that constitutional norms must be respected , " schröder said .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .
" effectively combating terror must be in the foreground , but it 's well understood in the united states that constitutional norms must be respected , " schröder said .

he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .
on wednesday , gew called a demonstration in berlin .
30,000 teachers and educators took to the streets of the german capital , demanding a reform of the country 's education system .
the head of gew , eva-maria stange , voiced strong support for the chancellor 's plans to strengthen the education sector .
she criticized plans of the german federal states , or länder , to cut back on education .
the berlin demonstration marked the start of a country-wide gew campaign called " save education " .
over the next few weeks , gew and the federal german parents association bundeselternrat -lrb- ber -rrb- will be highlighting the miserable state of the german education system through posters , discussions and demonstrations across the country .
education for export since germany is a country low in natural resources , the only thing the country can export is high quality products and technical know-how .
and that 's what makes education and training vitally important for germany : the country will only be able to succeed in a globalized world economy in the future if german workers , engineers and scientists maintain their high level of training and efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in germany most germans are aware of the fact that the country can only keep its edge on the competition through good training .
that 's why germans were shocked earlier this year , when an international study revealed that students here were lagging far behind school kids in other countries in basic skills like reading and mathematics .
german students finished far behind schoolchildren from finland , spain , italy and the u.s. up to then , germans had been proud of their education system , thinking it one of the best in the world .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .
" effectively combating terror must be in the foreground , but it 's well understood in the united states that constitutional norms must be respected , " schröder said .
france has also said it will withhold evidence relating to moussaoui if the u.s. does not agree to set aside the possiblity of the death penalty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe and america take stock unlimited solidarity has turned to wary support in the transatlantic relationship , as a host of thorny economic and politic issues strain relations between europe and the us .

he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .
on wednesday , gew called a demonstration in berlin .
30,000 teachers and educators took to the streets of the german capital , demanding a reform of the country 's education system .
the head of gew , eva-maria stange , voiced strong support for the chancellor 's plans to strengthen the education sector .
she criticized plans of the german federal states , or länder , to cut back on education .
the berlin demonstration marked the start of a country-wide gew campaign called " save education " .
over the next few weeks , gew and the federal german parents association bundeselternrat -lrb- ber -rrb- will be highlighting the miserable state of the german education system through posters , discussions and demonstrations across the country .
education for export since germany is a country low in natural resources , the only thing the country can export is high quality products and technical know-how .
and that 's what makes education and training vitally important for germany : the country will only be able to succeed in a globalized world economy in the future if german workers , engineers and scientists maintain their high level of training and efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in germany most germans are aware of the fact that the country can only keep its edge on the competition through good training .
that 's why germans were shocked earlier this year , when an international study revealed that students here were lagging far behind school kids in other countries in basic skills like reading and mathematics .
german students finished far behind schoolchildren from finland , spain , italy and the u.s. up to then , germans had been proud of their education system , thinking it one of the best in the world .
but the international " pisa " test , in which the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- compared students in 32 countries , shocked the germans out of their complacency .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .
" effectively combating terror must be in the foreground , but it 's well understood in the united states that constitutional norms must be respected , " schröder said .
france has also said it will withhold evidence relating to moussaoui if the u.s. does not agree to set aside the possiblity of the death penalty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe and america take stock unlimited solidarity has turned to wary support in the transatlantic relationship , as a host of thorny economic and politic issues strain relations between europe and the us .

he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .
on wednesday , gew called a demonstration in berlin .
30,000 teachers and educators took to the streets of the german capital , demanding a reform of the country 's education system .
the head of gew , eva-maria stange , voiced strong support for the chancellor 's plans to strengthen the education sector .
she criticized plans of the german federal states , or länder , to cut back on education .
the berlin demonstration marked the start of a country-wide gew campaign called " save education " .
over the next few weeks , gew and the federal german parents association bundeselternrat -lrb- ber -rrb- will be highlighting the miserable state of the german education system through posters , discussions and demonstrations across the country .
education for export since germany is a country low in natural resources , the only thing the country can export is high quality products and technical know-how .
and that 's what makes education and training vitally important for germany : the country will only be able to succeed in a globalized world economy in the future if german workers , engineers and scientists maintain their high level of training and efficiency .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .
" effectively combating terror must be in the foreground , but it 's well understood in the united states that constitutional norms must be respected , " schröder said .
france has also said it will withhold evidence relating to moussaoui if the u.s. does not agree to set aside the possiblity of the death penalty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe and america take stock unlimited solidarity has turned to wary support in the transatlantic relationship , as a host of thorny economic and politic issues strain relations between europe and the us .

he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .
on wednesday , gew called a demonstration in berlin .
30,000 teachers and educators took to the streets of the german capital , demanding a reform of the country 's education system .
the head of gew , eva-maria stange , voiced strong support for the chancellor 's plans to strengthen the education sector .
she criticized plans of the german federal states , or länder , to cut back on education .
the berlin demonstration marked the start of a country-wide gew campaign called " save education " .
over the next few weeks , gew and the federal german parents association bundeselternrat -lrb- ber -rrb- will be highlighting the miserable state of the german education system through posters , discussions and demonstrations across the country .
education for export since germany is a country low in natural resources , the only thing the country can export is high quality products and technical know-how .
and that 's what makes education and training vitally important for germany : the country will only be able to succeed in a globalized world economy in the future if german workers , engineers and scientists maintain their high level of training and efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in germany most germans are aware of the fact that the country can only keep its edge on the competition through good training .
that 's why germans were shocked earlier this year , when an international study revealed that students here were lagging far behind school kids in other countries in basic skills like reading and mathematics .
german students finished far behind schoolchildren from finland , spain , italy and the u.s. up to then , germans had been proud of their education system , thinking it one of the best in the world .
but the international " pisa " test , in which the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- compared students in 32 countries , shocked the germans out of their complacency .
the " pisa " study put german schools in 25th place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany brings home a bad report card germany is shocked after an international test reveals that the country 's schools do not live up to their reputation .

now fears that the takeover could mark the start of a growing us influence in european defence , have arisen . earlier this month , the eu commission approved the 75 per cent stake sale of german shipbuilder hdw to the us investment group one equity partners .
the sale went surprisingly smooth , meeting little resistance among germany ’ s political ranks .
the fact concerns european arms manufacturers , who fear the sale could be the first step in an american run on europe 's arms industry .
" hdw was a test case for the americans , " according to ernst otto krämer , chairman of defence technology company rheinmetall detec ag . calls for more european coordination " i can see the danger that the basis of europe ’ s defence technology could be lost , " said walther stüzle , a high-ranking official in germany ’ s defense ministry .
angela beer , the german green party 's defense policy expert , also warned of america 's growing influence on german and european defense earlier this month .
the takeover , she said , could severely hinder plans for a pan-european cooperation in arms manufacturing .
indeed , the european commission has been pushing for greater coordination of european defense as a way of boosting european competitiveness against the us .
an advisory committee to the eu commission has drawn up a report which it will present to the commission ’ s president , romani prodi , in july .
the committee is expected to advise the eu to focus on more joint purchasing and better cooperation between civilian and military aerospace .
lacking in key support material one of the main reasons for europe 's sudden interest in armed forces cooperation lies in problems encountered during nato 's 1999 campaign against serbia in kosovo .
according to defence expert thomas kane , operation allied force revealed that all western european armed forces are short of munitions and lacking in key support material .
the conflict in bosnia highlighted a need for improvements in european defense , the european association of aerospace industries -lrb- aecma -rrb- say .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among these programmes is the a400m , europe ’ s biggest joint military project ever .
according to aecma , " such programmes also foster industial partnerships " .
but excitement surrounding the project was overshadowed by months of political wrangling as germany debated whether it had the money to pay for its share of the project .
the debate highlighted the problems european countries are having coming up with defense money in the current economic slowdown .
the 196 a400m planes planned on being built by eight european countries are expected to cost some $ 16.5 billion -lrb- 18 billion euro -rrb- .
defence spending gap despite a global rise in military spending across the globe after september 11 , defence spending in europe has slowed .
this year , the us military budget is expected to reach $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- .
the $ 33 billion increase from last year makes america the world ’ s leading defence spender .
the gap is particularly great between the us and germany , which spends 12 times less at about $ 30 billion .
in germany , conversion and demobilization programmes have led to a 50 per cent reduction in the country ’ s military spending .
germany , along with other european states burdened by tight national budgets , has proved reluctant to hop on the us defense spending train .
reluctance to join efforts within germany according to walther stüzle , any danger of losing european defense technology " can only be fended off by clear and effective steps towards a consolidation of germany ’ s military industry " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hdw logo but there is no evidence that german defence players are joining efforts to consolidate their industry .
there were no german bidders for both shipbuilder hdw or siemen ’ s 49 per cent stake in kraus-maffei wegmann , the munich-based builder of leopard tanks , currently up for sale .
german companies tend to blame the german government for lack of support , unclear about future aims and sluggish spending .
" unlike the us , the german government does not see the defence industry in a context of national security , " ernst otto krämer from rheinmetall detec ag told handelsblatt .
but now , politicians across the political spectrum are warning that germany may be left behind in matters of military technology .
according to hans ulrich klose , the government ’ s foreign affairs committe chairman , " it is uncontended that europe -lrb- in security policy -rrb- has fallen far back . "

now fears that the takeover could mark the start of a growing us influence in european defence , have arisen . earlier this month , the eu commission approved the 75 per cent stake sale of german shipbuilder hdw to the us investment group one equity partners .
the sale went surprisingly smooth , meeting little resistance among germany ’ s political ranks .
the fact concerns european arms manufacturers , who fear the sale could be the first step in an american run on europe 's arms industry .
" hdw was a test case for the americans , " according to ernst otto krämer , chairman of defence technology company rheinmetall detec ag . calls for more european coordination " i can see the danger that the basis of europe ’ s defence technology could be lost , " said walther stüzle , a high-ranking official in germany ’ s defense ministry .
angela beer , the german green party 's defense policy expert , also warned of america 's growing influence on german and european defense earlier this month .
the takeover , she said , could severely hinder plans for a pan-european cooperation in arms manufacturing .
indeed , the european commission has been pushing for greater coordination of european defense as a way of boosting european competitiveness against the us .
an advisory committee to the eu commission has drawn up a report which it will present to the commission ’ s president , romani prodi , in july .
the committee is expected to advise the eu to focus on more joint purchasing and better cooperation between civilian and military aerospace .
lacking in key support material one of the main reasons for europe 's sudden interest in armed forces cooperation lies in problems encountered during nato 's 1999 campaign against serbia in kosovo .
according to defence expert thomas kane , operation allied force revealed that all western european armed forces are short of munitions and lacking in key support material .
the conflict in bosnia highlighted a need for improvements in european defense , the european association of aerospace industries -lrb- aecma -rrb- say .
" new programmes are required to satisfy military requirements " according to a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among these programmes is the a400m , europe ’ s biggest joint military project ever .
according to aecma , " such programmes also foster industial partnerships " .
but excitement surrounding the project was overshadowed by months of political wrangling as germany debated whether it had the money to pay for its share of the project .
the debate highlighted the problems european countries are having coming up with defense money in the current economic slowdown .
the 196 a400m planes planned on being built by eight european countries are expected to cost some $ 16.5 billion -lrb- 18 billion euro -rrb- .
defence spending gap despite a global rise in military spending across the globe after september 11 , defence spending in europe has slowed .
this year , the us military budget is expected to reach $ 343 billion -lrb- 369 billion euro -rrb- .
the $ 33 billion increase from last year makes america the world ’ s leading defence spender .
the gap is particularly great between the us and germany , which spends 12 times less at about $ 30 billion .
in germany , conversion and demobilization programmes have led to a 50 per cent reduction in the country ’ s military spending .
germany , along with other european states burdened by tight national budgets , has proved reluctant to hop on the us defense spending train .

now , the tiny east german town is hoping the crumbling complex can recapture its old allure - and profits . it is the perfect backdrop for a fairytale .
standing in a grove of beech trees , on the shore of a smooth , grey lake stands a large , half-timbered villa .
mist shrouds its blackened roof .
this building , which lies on the zenssee in hohenlychen , less than an hour ’ s drive from berlin , has sunk into the mists of oblivion .
ingo lück leads the way through an iron gate , legacy of the russian army , decorated with a bright red star .
the hobby historian and hohenlychen enthusiast is one of the few locals to set foot here on a regular basis .
discarded by its last inhabitants , the russian army , and misused by the nazis , locals tend to avoid this secluded spot in brandenburg ’ s woods .
beyond the gate , several large , greying buildings stand forlorn and dilapidated in the drizzling rain .
lück points out turrets , stained glass windows , arched doorways .
they were designed , he explains , a century ago to please the children of affluent north germans , and were made to look like small castles .
what is left today of the former children ’ s sanatorium is a cluster of large villas , with crumbling turrets , bordered up bay windows and overgrown , unkempt gardens .
even today , with its breathtaking view , historic flair , numerous glass fronts and huge balconies , the former sanatorium would make the perfect setting for a place to relax and recuperate .
it would also bring a welcome boost to a depressed east german town facing 30 per cent unemployment .
hohenlychen ’ s mayor evelyn wienold sighs .
" lychen isn ’ t as chic as the baltic seaside resorts " she says – referring to those former east german coastal towns newly renovated and still gleaming in fresh paint .
" we just don ’ t have the cafes , the restaurants and the shops to attract visitors " .
there was a time things were different .
from children ’ s home to top recuperation destination built by the berlin red cross in 1902 as an alternative to sanatoriums in switzerland for children suffering from tuberculosis , it soon evolved into a leading health and relaxation destination .
by the 1930s the " märkische interlaken " - the northern equivalent to the popular holiday resort in the alps - had gained worldwide recognition .
" jesse owens , king george iv , max schmeling , the japanese emperor " all stayed at hohenlychen , says lück , listing the names as he treads his way across threadbare floorboards and broken tiles , his footsteps crunching on shattered glass .
" those were the days when the sanatorium was hohenlychen ’ s main bread-winner " , he explains .
the complex not only employed gardners , maids and nurses , its good reputation also supported the local hotel industry .
the sanatorium itself employed up to 400 people , about 400,000 in need of recuperation stayed in the tiny village at the best of times .
" the sanatorium was a motor for trade in the area " , mayor wienold says . trying to close a horrific chapter by the mid 1930s , the sanatorium ’ s reputation began to change for the worse .
with the 1936 olympics in mind , top nazi doctor prof. dr. karl gebhardt built up a new clinic for sport medicine at the sanatorium , complete with swimming pool , sports hall , arena and massage benches .
during his position as top doctor at the sanatorium , gebhardt ’ s deputies conducted experiments using sulfanomid , a possible remedy to war injuries .
the chosen guinea-pigs were mostly women , prisoners at the nearby konzentrationslager ravensbrück .
their legs cut open and deliberately infected with bacteria , wood shavings and glass splitters , the men and women suffered indescribable pain and excruciating deaths .
furthermore , gebhardt carried out more experiments in plastic surgery , such as the extraction of a prisoner ’ s shoulder-bone and replacing it in a young soldier ’ s body .
it is still contended whether some of these operations actually took place at hohenlychen , which by then had an extraordinarily well-equipped operation room and the latest in medicinal technology .
gebhardt , later sentenced to death in nuremberg , was said to have never performed experiments himself , transferring the responsibility to the doctors at ravensbrück .
" everyone immediately links hohenlychen to gebhardt ’ s experiments " , lück says , with resignation in his voice .
" but the experiments themselves all took place at the concentration camp . "
opening a narrow door to to a former physiotherapy room , lück explains how four time gold medalist jesse owens had a knee operation at the sanatorium during the 1936 olympics .
the fact that the black american was treated here is an important one for lück and the rest of the village .
" we do not deny gebhardt ’ s responsibility " , he says .
but it is the constant connection between the sanatorium and the makings of one treacherous doctor which is clearly regretted by the village .
a common , yet unique obstacle " it is not the sanatorium ’ s past which discourages potential investors " , dr. roland schneider , monument protection commissioner at brandenburg ’ s building ministry claims .
the reasons he says , are manifold .
hohenlychen is faced with a problem common to villages , towns and cities across eastern germany : vacancy .
a shrinking economy , a rise in unemployment , plus an exodus of 1 million looking for better job opportunities and higher wages in the west since reunification , has led to a 13 per cent level of both urban , and rural vacancy in eastern germany , including a large number of old buildings under monument protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one million apartments in east german high-rise apartment blocks – the hallmark of the former gdr – stand empty , the state of vacant old buildings , such as the former sanatorium in hohenlychen , easily fall short of public awareness .
as a result , getting public funding is no easy task .
the sanatorium ’ s rural location makes it easy to get overlooked by programs such as " rebuilding east " a 2 billion euro federal aid package that aims to revitalize former east german cities .
the sanatorium ’ s unique layout also poses a problem , concedes schneider .
it is almost impossible to find one investor to purchase the 10 buildings spread across 15 hectares of land .
" we are therefore looking for several , separate investors , " he says .
a ray of hope today , there is new hope for the small village and its troubled sanatorium .
a southern german company has bought one of the larger buildings and plans to turn it into a home for the elderly later this year .
though the company plans a tedious renovation of the building and its immediate surroundings , the other buildings remain an eyesore .
on the way out , lück points to a small building , which lück explains , was one of the very first .
" just look at the turrets , the timberwork , the stained glass – perfect for a child ’ s fairytale " .
as in a fairytale , the sanatorium has its own gruesome and chilling chapter .

with the 1936 olympics in mind , top nazi doctor prof. dr. karl gebhardt built up a new clinic for sport medicine at the sanatorium , complete with swimming pool , sports hall , arena and massage benches .
during his position as top doctor at the sanatorium , gebhardt ’ s deputies conducted experiments using sulfanomid , a possible remedy to war injuries .
the chosen guinea-pigs were mostly women , prisoners at the nearby konzentrationslager ravensbrück .
their legs cut open and deliberately infected with bacteria , wood shavings and glass splitters , the men and women suffered indescribable pain and excruciating deaths .
furthermore , gebhardt carried out more experiments in plastic surgery , such as the extraction of a prisoner ’ s shoulder-bone and replacing it in a young soldier ’ s body .
it is still contended whether some of these operations actually took place at hohenlychen , which by then had an extraordinarily well-equipped operation room and the latest in medicinal technology .
gebhardt , later sentenced to death in nuremberg , was said to have never performed experiments himself , transferring the responsibility to the doctors at ravensbrück .
" everyone immediately links hohenlychen to gebhardt ’ s experiments " , lück says , with resignation in his voice .
" but the experiments themselves all took place at the concentration camp . "
opening a narrow door to to a former physiotherapy room , lück explains how four time gold medalist jesse owens had a knee operation at the sanatorium during the 1936 olympics .
the fact that the black american was treated here is an important one for lück and the rest of the village .
" we do not deny gebhardt ’ s responsibility " , he says .
but it is the constant connection between the sanatorium and the makings of one treacherous doctor which is clearly regretted by the village .
a common , yet unique obstacle " it is not the sanatorium ’ s past which discourages potential investors " , dr. roland schneider , monument protection commissioner at brandenburg ’ s building ministry claims .
the reasons he says , are manifold .
hohenlychen is faced with a problem common to villages , towns and cities across eastern germany : vacancy .
a shrinking economy , a rise in unemployment , plus an exodus of 1 million looking for better job opportunities and higher wages in the west since reunification , has led to a 13 per cent level of both urban , and rural vacancy in eastern germany , including a large number of old buildings under monument protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one million apartments in east german high-rise apartment blocks – the hallmark of the former gdr – stand empty , the state of vacant old buildings , such as the former sanatorium in hohenlychen , easily fall short of public awareness .
as a result , getting public funding is no easy task .
the sanatorium ’ s rural location makes it easy to get overlooked by programs such as " rebuilding east " a 2 billion euro federal aid package that aims to revitalize former east german cities .
the sanatorium ’ s unique layout also poses a problem , concedes schneider .
it is almost impossible to find one investor to purchase the 10 buildings spread across 15 hectares of land .
" we are therefore looking for several , separate investors , " he says .
a ray of hope today , there is new hope for the small village and its troubled sanatorium .
a southern german company has bought one of the larger buildings and plans to turn it into a home for the elderly later this year .
though the company plans a tedious renovation of the building and its immediate surroundings , the other buildings remain an eyesore .
on the way out , lück points to a small building , which lück explains , was one of the very first .

now , the tiny east german town is hoping the crumbling complex can recapture its old allure - and profits . it is the perfect backdrop for a fairytale .
standing in a grove of beech trees , on the shore of a smooth , grey lake stands a large , half-timbered villa .
mist shrouds its blackened roof .
this building , which lies on the zenssee in hohenlychen , less than an hour ’ s drive from berlin , has sunk into the mists of oblivion .
ingo lück leads the way through an iron gate , legacy of the russian army , decorated with a bright red star .
the hobby historian and hohenlychen enthusiast is one of the few locals to set foot here on a regular basis .
discarded by its last inhabitants , the russian army , and misused by the nazis , locals tend to avoid this secluded spot in brandenburg ’ s woods .
beyond the gate , several large , greying buildings stand forlorn and dilapidated in the drizzling rain .
lück points out turrets , stained glass windows , arched doorways .
they were designed , he explains , a century ago to please the children of affluent north germans , and were made to look like small castles .
what is left today of the former children ’ s sanatorium is a cluster of large villas , with crumbling turrets , bordered up bay windows and overgrown , unkempt gardens .
even today , with its breathtaking view , historic flair , numerous glass fronts and huge balconies , the former sanatorium would make the perfect setting for a place to relax and recuperate .
it would also bring a welcome boost to a depressed east german town facing 30 per cent unemployment .
hohenlychen ’ s mayor evelyn wienold sighs .
" lychen isn ’ t as chic as the baltic seaside resorts " she says – referring to those former east german coastal towns newly renovated and still gleaming in fresh paint .
" we just don ’ t have the cafes , the restaurants and the shops to attract visitors " .
there was a time things were different .
from children ’ s home to top recuperation destination built by the berlin red cross in 1902 as an alternative to sanatoriums in switzerland for children suffering from tuberculosis , it soon evolved into a leading health and relaxation destination .
by the 1930s the " märkische interlaken " - the northern equivalent to the popular holiday resort in the alps - had gained worldwide recognition .
" jesse owens , king george iv , max schmeling , the japanese emperor " all stayed at hohenlychen , says lück , listing the names as he treads his way across threadbare floorboards and broken tiles , his footsteps crunching on shattered glass .
" those were the days when the sanatorium was hohenlychen ’ s main bread-winner " , he explains .
the complex not only employed gardners , maids and nurses , its good reputation also supported the local hotel industry .
the sanatorium itself employed up to 400 people , about 400,000 in need of recuperation stayed in the tiny village at the best of times .

now , the tiny east german town is hoping the crumbling complex can recapture its old allure - and profits . it is the perfect backdrop for a fairytale .
standing in a grove of beech trees , on the shore of a smooth , grey lake stands a large , half-timbered villa .
mist shrouds its blackened roof .
this building , which lies on the zenssee in hohenlychen , less than an hour ’ s drive from berlin , has sunk into the mists of oblivion .
ingo lück leads the way through an iron gate , legacy of the russian army , decorated with a bright red star .
the hobby historian and hohenlychen enthusiast is one of the few locals to set foot here on a regular basis .
discarded by its last inhabitants , the russian army , and misused by the nazis , locals tend to avoid this secluded spot in brandenburg ’ s woods .
beyond the gate , several large , greying buildings stand forlorn and dilapidated in the drizzling rain .
lück points out turrets , stained glass windows , arched doorways .
they were designed , he explains , a century ago to please the children of affluent north germans , and were made to look like small castles .
what is left today of the former children ’ s sanatorium is a cluster of large villas , with crumbling turrets , bordered up bay windows and overgrown , unkempt gardens .
even today , with its breathtaking view , historic flair , numerous glass fronts and huge balconies , the former sanatorium would make the perfect setting for a place to relax and recuperate .
it would also bring a welcome boost to a depressed east german town facing 30 per cent unemployment .
hohenlychen ’ s mayor evelyn wienold sighs .
" lychen isn ’ t as chic as the baltic seaside resorts " she says – referring to those former east german coastal towns newly renovated and still gleaming in fresh paint .
" we just don ’ t have the cafes , the restaurants and the shops to attract visitors " .
there was a time things were different .
from children ’ s home to top recuperation destination built by the berlin red cross in 1902 as an alternative to sanatoriums in switzerland for children suffering from tuberculosis , it soon evolved into a leading health and relaxation destination .
by the 1930s the " märkische interlaken " - the northern equivalent to the popular holiday resort in the alps - had gained worldwide recognition .
" jesse owens , king george iv , max schmeling , the japanese emperor " all stayed at hohenlychen , says lück , listing the names as he treads his way across threadbare floorboards and broken tiles , his footsteps crunching on shattered glass .
" those were the days when the sanatorium was hohenlychen ’ s main bread-winner " , he explains .
the complex not only employed gardners , maids and nurses , its good reputation also supported the local hotel industry .
the sanatorium itself employed up to 400 people , about 400,000 in need of recuperation stayed in the tiny village at the best of times .
" the sanatorium was a motor for trade in the area " , mayor wienold says . trying to close a horrific chapter by the mid 1930s , the sanatorium ’ s reputation began to change for the worse .
with the 1936 olympics in mind , top nazi doctor prof. dr. karl gebhardt built up a new clinic for sport medicine at the sanatorium , complete with swimming pool , sports hall , arena and massage benches .
during his position as top doctor at the sanatorium , gebhardt ’ s deputies conducted experiments using sulfanomid , a possible remedy to war injuries .
the chosen guinea-pigs were mostly women , prisoners at the nearby konzentrationslager ravensbrück .
their legs cut open and deliberately infected with bacteria , wood shavings and glass splitters , the men and women suffered indescribable pain and excruciating deaths .
furthermore , gebhardt carried out more experiments in plastic surgery , such as the extraction of a prisoner ’ s shoulder-bone and replacing it in a young soldier ’ s body .
it is still contended whether some of these operations actually took place at hohenlychen , which by then had an extraordinarily well-equipped operation room and the latest in medicinal technology .
gebhardt , later sentenced to death in nuremberg , was said to have never performed experiments himself , transferring the responsibility to the doctors at ravensbrück .
" everyone immediately links hohenlychen to gebhardt ’ s experiments " , lück says , with resignation in his voice .
" but the experiments themselves all took place at the concentration camp . "
opening a narrow door to to a former physiotherapy room , lück explains how four time gold medalist jesse owens had a knee operation at the sanatorium during the 1936 olympics .
the fact that the black american was treated here is an important one for lück and the rest of the village .
" we do not deny gebhardt ’ s responsibility " , he says .
but it is the constant connection between the sanatorium and the makings of one treacherous doctor which is clearly regretted by the village .
a common , yet unique obstacle " it is not the sanatorium ’ s past which discourages potential investors " , dr. roland schneider , monument protection commissioner at brandenburg ’ s building ministry claims .
the reasons he says , are manifold .
hohenlychen is faced with a problem common to villages , towns and cities across eastern germany : vacancy .
a shrinking economy , a rise in unemployment , plus an exodus of 1 million looking for better job opportunities and higher wages in the west since reunification , has led to a 13 per cent level of both urban , and rural vacancy in eastern germany , including a large number of old buildings under monument protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one million apartments in east german high-rise apartment blocks – the hallmark of the former gdr – stand empty , the state of vacant old buildings , such as the former sanatorium in hohenlychen , easily fall short of public awareness .
as a result , getting public funding is no easy task .
the sanatorium ’ s rural location makes it easy to get overlooked by programs such as " rebuilding east " a 2 billion euro federal aid package that aims to revitalize former east german cities .
the sanatorium ’ s unique layout also poses a problem , concedes schneider .
it is almost impossible to find one investor to purchase the 10 buildings spread across 15 hectares of land .
" we are therefore looking for several , separate investors , " he says .
a ray of hope today , there is new hope for the small village and its troubled sanatorium .
a southern german company has bought one of the larger buildings and plans to turn it into a home for the elderly later this year .
though the company plans a tedious renovation of the building and its immediate surroundings , the other buildings remain an eyesore .
on the way out , lück points to a small building , which lück explains , was one of the very first .
" just look at the turrets , the timberwork , the stained glass – perfect for a child ’ s fairytale " .
as in a fairytale , the sanatorium has its own gruesome and chilling chapter .

he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .

he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .

if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .
" effectively combating terror must be in the foreground , but it 's well understood in the united states that constitutional norms must be respected , " schröder said .
france has also said it will withhold evidence relating to moussaoui if the u.s. does not agree to set aside the possiblity of the death penalty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe and america take stock unlimited solidarity has turned to wary support in the transatlantic relationship , as a host of thorny economic and politic issues strain relations between europe and the us .

the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .

he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .
on wednesday , gew called a demonstration in berlin .
30,000 teachers and educators took to the streets of the german capital , demanding a reform of the country 's education system .
the head of gew , eva-maria stange , voiced strong support for the chancellor 's plans to strengthen the education sector .
she criticized plans of the german federal states , or länder , to cut back on education .
the berlin demonstration marked the start of a country-wide gew campaign called " save education " .
over the next few weeks , gew and the federal german parents association bundeselternrat -lrb- ber -rrb- will be highlighting the miserable state of the german education system through posters , discussions and demonstrations across the country .
education for export since germany is a country low in natural resources , the only thing the country can export is high quality products and technical know-how .
and that 's what makes education and training vitally important for germany : the country will only be able to succeed in a globalized world economy in the future if german workers , engineers and scientists maintain their high level of training and efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in germany most germans are aware of the fact that the country can only keep its edge on the competition through good training .
that 's why germans were shocked earlier this year , when an international study revealed that students here were lagging far behind school kids in other countries in basic skills like reading and mathematics .

education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .
on wednesday , gew called a demonstration in berlin .
30,000 teachers and educators took to the streets of the german capital , demanding a reform of the country 's education system .
the head of gew , eva-maria stange , voiced strong support for the chancellor 's plans to strengthen the education sector .
she criticized plans of the german federal states , or länder , to cut back on education .
the berlin demonstration marked the start of a country-wide gew campaign called " save education " .
over the next few weeks , gew and the federal german parents association bundeselternrat -lrb- ber -rrb- will be highlighting the miserable state of the german education system through posters , discussions and demonstrations across the country .
education for export since germany is a country low in natural resources , the only thing the country can export is high quality products and technical know-how .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .
" effectively combating terror must be in the foreground , but it 's well understood in the united states that constitutional norms must be respected , " schröder said .
france has also said it will withhold evidence relating to moussaoui if the u.s. does not agree to set aside the possiblity of the death penalty . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe and america take stock unlimited solidarity has turned to wary support in the transatlantic relationship , as a host of thorny economic and politic issues strain relations between europe and the us .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .
" effectively combating terror must be in the foreground , but it 's well understood in the united states that constitutional norms must be respected , " schröder said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.06.2002 german schools - ripe for reform ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training has to start earlier , says the german chancellor chancellor schröder has promised more money for schools .
he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .
on wednesday , gew called a demonstration in berlin .
30,000 teachers and educators took to the streets of the german capital , demanding a reform of the country 's education system .
the head of gew , eva-maria stange , voiced strong support for the chancellor 's plans to strengthen the education sector .
she criticized plans of the german federal states , or länder , to cut back on education .
the berlin demonstration marked the start of a country-wide gew campaign called " save education " .
over the next few weeks , gew and the federal german parents association bundeselternrat -lrb- ber -rrb- will be highlighting the miserable state of the german education system through posters , discussions and demonstrations across the country .
education for export since germany is a country low in natural resources , the only thing the country can export is high quality products and technical know-how .
and that 's what makes education and training vitally important for germany : the country will only be able to succeed in a globalized world economy in the future if german workers , engineers and scientists maintain their high level of training and efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in germany most germans are aware of the fact that the country can only keep its edge on the competition through good training .
that 's why germans were shocked earlier this year , when an international study revealed that students here were lagging far behind school kids in other countries in basic skills like reading and mathematics .
german students finished far behind schoolchildren from finland , spain , italy and the u.s. up to then , germans had been proud of their education system , thinking it one of the best in the world .
but the international " pisa " test , in which the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- compared students in 32 countries , shocked the germans out of their complacency .
the " pisa " study put german schools in 25th place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany brings home a bad report card germany is shocked after an international test reveals that the country 's schools do not live up to their reputation .

now , the tiny east german town is hoping the crumbling complex can recapture its old allure - and profits . it is the perfect backdrop for a fairytale .
standing in a grove of beech trees , on the shore of a smooth , grey lake stands a large , half-timbered villa .
mist shrouds its blackened roof .
this building , which lies on the zenssee in hohenlychen , less than an hour ’ s drive from berlin , has sunk into the mists of oblivion .
ingo lück leads the way through an iron gate , legacy of the russian army , decorated with a bright red star .
the hobby historian and hohenlychen enthusiast is one of the few locals to set foot here on a regular basis .
discarded by its last inhabitants , the russian army , and misused by the nazis , locals tend to avoid this secluded spot in brandenburg ’ s woods .
beyond the gate , several large , greying buildings stand forlorn and dilapidated in the drizzling rain .
lück points out turrets , stained glass windows , arched doorways .
they were designed , he explains , a century ago to please the children of affluent north germans , and were made to look like small castles .
what is left today of the former children ’ s sanatorium is a cluster of large villas , with crumbling turrets , bordered up bay windows and overgrown , unkempt gardens .
even today , with its breathtaking view , historic flair , numerous glass fronts and huge balconies , the former sanatorium would make the perfect setting for a place to relax and recuperate .
it would also bring a welcome boost to a depressed east german town facing 30 per cent unemployment .
hohenlychen ’ s mayor evelyn wienold sighs .
" lychen isn ’ t as chic as the baltic seaside resorts " she says – referring to those former east german coastal towns newly renovated and still gleaming in fresh paint .
" we just don ’ t have the cafes , the restaurants and the shops to attract visitors " .
there was a time things were different .
from children ’ s home to top recuperation destination built by the berlin red cross in 1902 as an alternative to sanatoriums in switzerland for children suffering from tuberculosis , it soon evolved into a leading health and relaxation destination .
by the 1930s the " märkische interlaken " - the northern equivalent to the popular holiday resort in the alps - had gained worldwide recognition .
" jesse owens , king george iv , max schmeling , the japanese emperor " all stayed at hohenlychen , says lück , listing the names as he treads his way across threadbare floorboards and broken tiles , his footsteps crunching on shattered glass .
" those were the days when the sanatorium was hohenlychen ’ s main bread-winner " , he explains .
the complex not only employed gardners , maids and nurses , its good reputation also supported the local hotel industry .
the sanatorium itself employed up to 400 people , about 400,000 in need of recuperation stayed in the tiny village at the best of times .
" the sanatorium was a motor for trade in the area " , mayor wienold says . trying to close a horrific chapter by the mid 1930s , the sanatorium ’ s reputation began to change for the worse .
with the 1936 olympics in mind , top nazi doctor prof. dr. karl gebhardt built up a new clinic for sport medicine at the sanatorium , complete with swimming pool , sports hall , arena and massage benches .
during his position as top doctor at the sanatorium , gebhardt ’ s deputies conducted experiments using sulfanomid , a possible remedy to war injuries .
the chosen guinea-pigs were mostly women , prisoners at the nearby konzentrationslager ravensbrück .
their legs cut open and deliberately infected with bacteria , wood shavings and glass splitters , the men and women suffered indescribable pain and excruciating deaths .
furthermore , gebhardt carried out more experiments in plastic surgery , such as the extraction of a prisoner ’ s shoulder-bone and replacing it in a young soldier ’ s body .
it is still contended whether some of these operations actually took place at hohenlychen , which by then had an extraordinarily well-equipped operation room and the latest in medicinal technology .
gebhardt , later sentenced to death in nuremberg , was said to have never performed experiments himself , transferring the responsibility to the doctors at ravensbrück .
" everyone immediately links hohenlychen to gebhardt ’ s experiments " , lück says , with resignation in his voice .
" but the experiments themselves all took place at the concentration camp . "
opening a narrow door to to a former physiotherapy room , lück explains how four time gold medalist jesse owens had a knee operation at the sanatorium during the 1936 olympics .
the fact that the black american was treated here is an important one for lück and the rest of the village .
" we do not deny gebhardt ’ s responsibility " , he says .
but it is the constant connection between the sanatorium and the makings of one treacherous doctor which is clearly regretted by the village .
a common , yet unique obstacle " it is not the sanatorium ’ s past which discourages potential investors " , dr. roland schneider , monument protection commissioner at brandenburg ’ s building ministry claims .
the reasons he says , are manifold .
hohenlychen is faced with a problem common to villages , towns and cities across eastern germany : vacancy .
a shrinking economy , a rise in unemployment , plus an exodus of 1 million looking for better job opportunities and higher wages in the west since reunification , has led to a 13 per cent level of both urban , and rural vacancy in eastern germany , including a large number of old buildings under monument protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one million apartments in east german high-rise apartment blocks – the hallmark of the former gdr – stand empty , the state of vacant old buildings , such as the former sanatorium in hohenlychen , easily fall short of public awareness .
as a result , getting public funding is no easy task .
the sanatorium ’ s rural location makes it easy to get overlooked by programs such as " rebuilding east " a 2 billion euro federal aid package that aims to revitalize former east german cities .
the sanatorium ’ s unique layout also poses a problem , concedes schneider .
it is almost impossible to find one investor to purchase the 10 buildings spread across 15 hectares of land .
" we are therefore looking for several , separate investors , " he says .
a ray of hope today , there is new hope for the small village and its troubled sanatorium .
a southern german company has bought one of the larger buildings and plans to turn it into a home for the elderly later this year .
though the company plans a tedious renovation of the building and its immediate surroundings , the other buildings remain an eyesore .
on the way out , lück points to a small building , which lück explains , was one of the very first .
" just look at the turrets , the timberwork , the stained glass – perfect for a child ’ s fairytale " .
as in a fairytale , the sanatorium has its own gruesome and chilling chapter .

now , the tiny east german town is hoping the crumbling complex can recapture its old allure - and profits . it is the perfect backdrop for a fairytale .
standing in a grove of beech trees , on the shore of a smooth , grey lake stands a large , half-timbered villa .
mist shrouds its blackened roof .
this building , which lies on the zenssee in hohenlychen , less than an hour ’ s drive from berlin , has sunk into the mists of oblivion .
ingo lück leads the way through an iron gate , legacy of the russian army , decorated with a bright red star .
the hobby historian and hohenlychen enthusiast is one of the few locals to set foot here on a regular basis .
discarded by its last inhabitants , the russian army , and misused by the nazis , locals tend to avoid this secluded spot in brandenburg ’ s woods .
beyond the gate , several large , greying buildings stand forlorn and dilapidated in the drizzling rain .
lück points out turrets , stained glass windows , arched doorways .
they were designed , he explains , a century ago to please the children of affluent north germans , and were made to look like small castles .
what is left today of the former children ’ s sanatorium is a cluster of large villas , with crumbling turrets , bordered up bay windows and overgrown , unkempt gardens .
even today , with its breathtaking view , historic flair , numerous glass fronts and huge balconies , the former sanatorium would make the perfect setting for a place to relax and recuperate .
it would also bring a welcome boost to a depressed east german town facing 30 per cent unemployment .
hohenlychen ’ s mayor evelyn wienold sighs .
" lychen isn ’ t as chic as the baltic seaside resorts " she says – referring to those former east german coastal towns newly renovated and still gleaming in fresh paint .
" we just don ’ t have the cafes , the restaurants and the shops to attract visitors " .
there was a time things were different .
from children ’ s home to top recuperation destination built by the berlin red cross in 1902 as an alternative to sanatoriums in switzerland for children suffering from tuberculosis , it soon evolved into a leading health and relaxation destination .
by the 1930s the " märkische interlaken " - the northern equivalent to the popular holiday resort in the alps - had gained worldwide recognition .
" jesse owens , king george iv , max schmeling , the japanese emperor " all stayed at hohenlychen , says lück , listing the names as he treads his way across threadbare floorboards and broken tiles , his footsteps crunching on shattered glass .
" those were the days when the sanatorium was hohenlychen ’ s main bread-winner " , he explains .
the complex not only employed gardners , maids and nurses , its good reputation also supported the local hotel industry .
the sanatorium itself employed up to 400 people , about 400,000 in need of recuperation stayed in the tiny village at the best of times .
" the sanatorium was a motor for trade in the area " , mayor wienold says . trying to close a horrific chapter by the mid 1930s , the sanatorium ’ s reputation began to change for the worse .
with the 1936 olympics in mind , top nazi doctor prof. dr. karl gebhardt built up a new clinic for sport medicine at the sanatorium , complete with swimming pool , sports hall , arena and massage benches .
during his position as top doctor at the sanatorium , gebhardt ’ s deputies conducted experiments using sulfanomid , a possible remedy to war injuries .
the chosen guinea-pigs were mostly women , prisoners at the nearby konzentrationslager ravensbrück .
their legs cut open and deliberately infected with bacteria , wood shavings and glass splitters , the men and women suffered indescribable pain and excruciating deaths .
furthermore , gebhardt carried out more experiments in plastic surgery , such as the extraction of a prisoner ’ s shoulder-bone and replacing it in a young soldier ’ s body .
it is still contended whether some of these operations actually took place at hohenlychen , which by then had an extraordinarily well-equipped operation room and the latest in medicinal technology .
gebhardt , later sentenced to death in nuremberg , was said to have never performed experiments himself , transferring the responsibility to the doctors at ravensbrück .
" everyone immediately links hohenlychen to gebhardt ’ s experiments " , lück says , with resignation in his voice .
" but the experiments themselves all took place at the concentration camp . "
opening a narrow door to to a former physiotherapy room , lück explains how four time gold medalist jesse owens had a knee operation at the sanatorium during the 1936 olympics .
the fact that the black american was treated here is an important one for lück and the rest of the village .
" we do not deny gebhardt ’ s responsibility " , he says .
but it is the constant connection between the sanatorium and the makings of one treacherous doctor which is clearly regretted by the village .
a common , yet unique obstacle " it is not the sanatorium ’ s past which discourages potential investors " , dr. roland schneider , monument protection commissioner at brandenburg ’ s building ministry claims .
the reasons he says , are manifold .
hohenlychen is faced with a problem common to villages , towns and cities across eastern germany : vacancy .
a shrinking economy , a rise in unemployment , plus an exodus of 1 million looking for better job opportunities and higher wages in the west since reunification , has led to a 13 per cent level of both urban , and rural vacancy in eastern germany , including a large number of old buildings under monument protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one million apartments in east german high-rise apartment blocks – the hallmark of the former gdr – stand empty , the state of vacant old buildings , such as the former sanatorium in hohenlychen , easily fall short of public awareness .
as a result , getting public funding is no easy task .
the sanatorium ’ s rural location makes it easy to get overlooked by programs such as " rebuilding east " a 2 billion euro federal aid package that aims to revitalize former east german cities .
the sanatorium ’ s unique layout also poses a problem , concedes schneider .
it is almost impossible to find one investor to purchase the 10 buildings spread across 15 hectares of land .
" we are therefore looking for several , separate investors , " he says .
a ray of hope today , there is new hope for the small village and its troubled sanatorium .
a southern german company has bought one of the larger buildings and plans to turn it into a home for the elderly later this year .
though the company plans a tedious renovation of the building and its immediate surroundings , the other buildings remain an eyesore .
on the way out , lück points to a small building , which lück explains , was one of the very first .
" just look at the turrets , the timberwork , the stained glass – perfect for a child ’ s fairytale " .
as in a fairytale , the sanatorium has its own gruesome and chilling chapter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.06.2002 german schools - ripe for reform ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training has to start earlier , says the german chancellor chancellor schröder has promised more money for schools .
he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .

he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .
" effectively combating terror must be in the foreground , but it 's well understood in the united states that constitutional norms must be respected , " schröder said .

he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .
on wednesday , gew called a demonstration in berlin .
30,000 teachers and educators took to the streets of the german capital , demanding a reform of the country 's education system .
the head of gew , eva-maria stange , voiced strong support for the chancellor 's plans to strengthen the education sector .
she criticized plans of the german federal states , or länder , to cut back on education .
the berlin demonstration marked the start of a country-wide gew campaign called " save education " .
over the next few weeks , gew and the federal german parents association bundeselternrat -lrb- ber -rrb- will be highlighting the miserable state of the german education system through posters , discussions and demonstrations across the country .
education for export since germany is a country low in natural resources , the only thing the country can export is high quality products and technical know-how .
and that 's what makes education and training vitally important for germany : the country will only be able to succeed in a globalized world economy in the future if german workers , engineers and scientists maintain their high level of training and efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in germany most germans are aware of the fact that the country can only keep its edge on the competition through good training .
that 's why germans were shocked earlier this year , when an international study revealed that students here were lagging far behind school kids in other countries in basic skills like reading and mathematics .
german students finished far behind schoolchildren from finland , spain , italy and the u.s. up to then , germans had been proud of their education system , thinking it one of the best in the world .
but the international " pisa " test , in which the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- compared students in 32 countries , shocked the germans out of their complacency .
the " pisa " study put german schools in 25th place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany brings home a bad report card germany is shocked after an international test reveals that the country 's schools do not live up to their reputation .

german authorities possess evidence that could help convict suspected terrorist zacarias moussaoui , but a constitutional ban on the death penalty is hindering the transfer of financial documents in the case . after september 11 , the german government pledged " unlimited solidarity " to the united states in the international war against terrorism .
troops bearing the german flag were dispatched to afghanistan and the horn of africa .
german authorities also became active in the investigation of suspected and known terrorists - especially those linked to the hamburg cell that planned the attacks in new york and washington .
nine months on , " unlimited solidarity " is turning to critical solidarity as fundamental differences between the two countries hinder aspects of their unified fight against terror .
germany 's ban on capital punishment has creating problems for transatlantic legal cooperation .
the limits of such cooperation are underscored by the current legal proceedings against zacarias moussaoui .
the path to the so-called " 20th hijacker " goes all the way to the hamburg-based terrorist cell in which mohammed atta was active .
officials in the u.s. arrested moussaoui , who is of french-morrocan origin , on august 16 because they became suspicious about his training at a minnesota aviation school .
u.s. officials now believe that moussaoui intended to be the fifth hijacker on the united airlines flight that crashed in rural pennsylvania on september 11 .
the flight carried only four hijackers , whereas the other planes each carried five . had he not been behind bars , they say moussaoui would have been on the jet , too .
a vexing constitutional issue in his upcoming trial on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , moussaoui is now being treated as a proxy for his suspected collaborators , and he 's even being threatened with the death penalty .
that 's where the problems start .
u.s. justice officials have requested that germany hand over files on financial transactions involving moussaoui that they say could help convict him .
the smoking gun at the center of the dilemma are two money transfer slips found by investigators in the basement of the reisebank in frankfurt , which u.s. authorities say contain crucial evidence against moussaoui .
according to the newsmagazine der spiegel , a young arab man going by the name ahad sabet twice wired funds from the reisebank to moussaoui via western union .
in total , $ 14,123 in funds were transferred in order to pay for moussaoui 's pilot training at the pan am academy .
authorities believe that sabet was an alias used by ramzi bin al-shibh , a close associate of mohammad atta who is now one of the most-wanted suspected terrorists in the world .
both the finger prints and handwriting on the document matched those of bin al-shibh , according to der spiegel .
german investigators provided copies of the documents to u.s. prosecutors , who have cited them extensively in the charges filed against moussaoi . but u.s. law requires that only original documents be used as evidence in a criminal trial .
seeking a deal for months , german negotiators have sought to strike a deal with american prosecutors : if the americans agree not to impose the death penalty , the german government would turn over the originals .
" the responsible authorities must very carefully examine whether one can assume that legal aid in such a case , where the death penalty will possibly be spoken of , is illegal , " says christian tomuschat , a professor at the human and european rights instititute at humboldt university in berlin .
" the ban on capital punishment is part of the foundations of the german law . "
german law , for example , unambiguosly prohibits the extradition of a suspected criminal if the other country is threatening to carry out the death penalty .
" such a specific rule does not exist for legal aid alone .
but it is also implicit in the logic of the ban of the death penalty to say , we also need to be reserved when it comes to a proceeding in a foreign country where the death penalty could be used in the end , " tomuschat notes .
german chancellor gerhard schröder told the international herald tribune on tuesday that the u.s. and germany are close to striking a deal on the transfer of the evidence .
" it 's exclusively to do with differing legal systems , " he said .
" i think that a common solution will be found very soon . "
" constitutional norms must be respected " the 40 countries of the european council have long banned the use of capital punishment and have generally refused to extradite suspects to any country threatening to impose it .
governments attempt in such cases to reach an agreement with the country seeking the extradition that it will not carry out the execution of the suspect if convicted . the same holds true for handing over evidence that could aid in a conviction .
" effectively combating terror must be in the foreground , but it 's well understood in the united states that constitutional norms must be respected , " schröder said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.06.2002 german schools - ripe for reform ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : training has to start earlier , says the german chancellor chancellor schröder has promised more money for schools .
he 's making education a central issue of this year 's election campaign .
but the opposition says schröder is to blame for the education malaise in germany . " education is the central social question of this century , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told parliament on thursday .
it was the first time ever that a german chancellor chose the topic of education and training for an official government address .
and the controversial debate that followed the chancellor 's speech showed that the topic is quickly becoming one of the key issues of this year 's election campaign .
education for all bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in thursday 's speech , chancellor schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said qualified training was the key to the job market , to social recognition and therefore the best way to prevent joblessness .
he said guaranteeing access to quality education for everyone was " the best investment in the future . "
with these statements , schröder echoed an idea that 's been dear to the heart of germany 's social democrats for decades : providing education for children from all walks of life – especially for kids with working-class backgrounds .
education should n't be a privilege of the rich , the social democrats argued in the 1970s and started ambitious student loan programs .
when helmut kohl and his christian democrats came to power in the early 1980s , these student aid programs were considerably cut back .
on thursday , gerhard schröder revived the idea of making education more accessible .
he told parliament that all students should receive support – irrelevant of their family 's social background .
" we can not afford to let a single talent go to waste , " the chancellor said .
all-day schooling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher and students one way to make education accessible for children from poorer families is all-day schooling .
if kids are taken care of at schools throughout the day , both parents are free to work .
but if only one of them can earn money because the other has to take care of the kids in the afternoons , the family budget is sometimes so tight that parents urge their children to leave school at an early age to get a job .
consequently , gerhard schröder promised to promote all-day schooling in thursday 's address to parliament .
he announced he would allocate four billion euro -lrb- $ 3.77 billion -rrb- to create 10,000 new all-day schools within the next four years .
he also pointed out that his government had increased the education budget by 21 percent since he came to power in 1998 .
" save education " according to a study commissioned by germany 's teachers ' union gew , more than half of all germans support the introduction of more all-day schools .
the study 's author , hans-günter rolff , said germany had failed miserably in supporting children from poorer families or with an immigrant background .
on wednesday , gew called a demonstration in berlin .
30,000 teachers and educators took to the streets of the german capital , demanding a reform of the country 's education system .
the head of gew , eva-maria stange , voiced strong support for the chancellor 's plans to strengthen the education sector .
she criticized plans of the german federal states , or länder , to cut back on education .
the berlin demonstration marked the start of a country-wide gew campaign called " save education " .
over the next few weeks , gew and the federal german parents association bundeselternrat -lrb- ber -rrb- will be highlighting the miserable state of the german education system through posters , discussions and demonstrations across the country .
education for export since germany is a country low in natural resources , the only thing the country can export is high quality products and technical know-how .
and that 's what makes education and training vitally important for germany : the country will only be able to succeed in a globalized world economy in the future if german workers , engineers and scientists maintain their high level of training and efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students in germany most germans are aware of the fact that the country can only keep its edge on the competition through good training .
that 's why germans were shocked earlier this year , when an international study revealed that students here were lagging far behind school kids in other countries in basic skills like reading and mathematics .
german students finished far behind schoolchildren from finland , spain , italy and the u.s. up to then , germans had been proud of their education system , thinking it one of the best in the world .
but the international " pisa " test , in which the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- compared students in 32 countries , shocked the germans out of their complacency .
the " pisa " study put german schools in 25th place . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany brings home a bad report card germany is shocked after an international test reveals that the country 's schools do not live up to their reputation .

now , the tiny east german town is hoping the crumbling complex can recapture its old allure - and profits . it is the perfect backdrop for a fairytale .
standing in a grove of beech trees , on the shore of a smooth , grey lake stands a large , half-timbered villa .
mist shrouds its blackened roof .
this building , which lies on the zenssee in hohenlychen , less than an hour ’ s drive from berlin , has sunk into the mists of oblivion .
ingo lück leads the way through an iron gate , legacy of the russian army , decorated with a bright red star .
the hobby historian and hohenlychen enthusiast is one of the few locals to set foot here on a regular basis .
discarded by its last inhabitants , the russian army , and misused by the nazis , locals tend to avoid this secluded spot in brandenburg ’ s woods .
beyond the gate , several large , greying buildings stand forlorn and dilapidated in the drizzling rain .
lück points out turrets , stained glass windows , arched doorways .
they were designed , he explains , a century ago to please the children of affluent north germans , and were made to look like small castles .
what is left today of the former children ’ s sanatorium is a cluster of large villas , with crumbling turrets , bordered up bay windows and overgrown , unkempt gardens .
even today , with its breathtaking view , historic flair , numerous glass fronts and huge balconies , the former sanatorium would make the perfect setting for a place to relax and recuperate .
it would also bring a welcome boost to a depressed east german town facing 30 per cent unemployment .
hohenlychen ’ s mayor evelyn wienold sighs .
" lychen isn ’ t as chic as the baltic seaside resorts " she says – referring to those former east german coastal towns newly renovated and still gleaming in fresh paint .
" we just don ’ t have the cafes , the restaurants and the shops to attract visitors " .
there was a time things were different .
from children ’ s home to top recuperation destination built by the berlin red cross in 1902 as an alternative to sanatoriums in switzerland for children suffering from tuberculosis , it soon evolved into a leading health and relaxation destination .
by the 1930s the " märkische interlaken " - the northern equivalent to the popular holiday resort in the alps - had gained worldwide recognition .
" jesse owens , king george iv , max schmeling , the japanese emperor " all stayed at hohenlychen , says lück , listing the names as he treads his way across threadbare floorboards and broken tiles , his footsteps crunching on shattered glass .
" those were the days when the sanatorium was hohenlychen ’ s main bread-winner " , he explains .
the complex not only employed gardners , maids and nurses , its good reputation also supported the local hotel industry .
the sanatorium itself employed up to 400 people , about 400,000 in need of recuperation stayed in the tiny village at the best of times .
" the sanatorium was a motor for trade in the area " , mayor wienold says . trying to close a horrific chapter by the mid 1930s , the sanatorium ’ s reputation began to change for the worse .
with the 1936 olympics in mind , top nazi doctor prof. dr. karl gebhardt built up a new clinic for sport medicine at the sanatorium , complete with swimming pool , sports hall , arena and massage benches .
during his position as top doctor at the sanatorium , gebhardt ’ s deputies conducted experiments using sulfanomid , a possible remedy to war injuries .
the chosen guinea-pigs were mostly women , prisoners at the nearby konzentrationslager ravensbrück .
their legs cut open and deliberately infected with bacteria , wood shavings and glass splitters , the men and women suffered indescribable pain and excruciating deaths .
furthermore , gebhardt carried out more experiments in plastic surgery , such as the extraction of a prisoner ’ s shoulder-bone and replacing it in a young soldier ’ s body .
it is still contended whether some of these operations actually took place at hohenlychen , which by then had an extraordinarily well-equipped operation room and the latest in medicinal technology .
gebhardt , later sentenced to death in nuremberg , was said to have never performed experiments himself , transferring the responsibility to the doctors at ravensbrück .
" everyone immediately links hohenlychen to gebhardt ’ s experiments " , lück says , with resignation in his voice .
" but the experiments themselves all took place at the concentration camp . "
opening a narrow door to to a former physiotherapy room , lück explains how four time gold medalist jesse owens had a knee operation at the sanatorium during the 1936 olympics .
the fact that the black american was treated here is an important one for lück and the rest of the village .
" we do not deny gebhardt ’ s responsibility " , he says .
but it is the constant connection between the sanatorium and the makings of one treacherous doctor which is clearly regretted by the village .
a common , yet unique obstacle " it is not the sanatorium ’ s past which discourages potential investors " , dr. roland schneider , monument protection commissioner at brandenburg ’ s building ministry claims .
the reasons he says , are manifold .
hohenlychen is faced with a problem common to villages , towns and cities across eastern germany : vacancy .
a shrinking economy , a rise in unemployment , plus an exodus of 1 million looking for better job opportunities and higher wages in the west since reunification , has led to a 13 per cent level of both urban , and rural vacancy in eastern germany , including a large number of old buildings under monument protection .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as one million apartments in east german high-rise apartment blocks – the hallmark of the former gdr – stand empty , the state of vacant old buildings , such as the former sanatorium in hohenlychen , easily fall short of public awareness .
as a result , getting public funding is no easy task .
the sanatorium ’ s rural location makes it easy to get overlooked by programs such as " rebuilding east " a 2 billion euro federal aid package that aims to revitalize former east german cities .
the sanatorium ’ s unique layout also poses a problem , concedes schneider .
it is almost impossible to find one investor to purchase the 10 buildings spread across 15 hectares of land .
" we are therefore looking for several , separate investors , " he says .
a ray of hope today , there is new hope for the small village and its troubled sanatorium .
a southern german company has bought one of the larger buildings and plans to turn it into a home for the elderly later this year .
though the company plans a tedious renovation of the building and its immediate surroundings , the other buildings remain an eyesore .
on the way out , lück points to a small building , which lück explains , was one of the very first .
" just look at the turrets , the timberwork , the stained glass – perfect for a child ’ s fairytale " .
as in a fairytale , the sanatorium has its own gruesome and chilling chapter .

biological weapons are potentially the most dangerous weapons in the world president bush the bill was designed to improve us defences against smallpox , anthrax and other deadly germ agents , by stockpiling vaccines , improving food inspections and boosting security for water systems .
in a white house ceremony after the signing , mr bush said it was his " urgent duty " to prevent germ warfare , and that last autumn 's anthrax attacks were a wake-up call for the us government .
" biological weapons are potentially the most dangerous weapons in the world , " he said .
" it 's important that we confront these real threats to our country and prepare for future emergencies . "
prepared for attack as well as increasing stockpiles of vaccines to combat a potential bioterrorism attack , the bill aims to increase the federal government 's supplies of potassium iodide , which can be used to help people exposed to radiation .
bioterrorism law increase stockpiles of vaccines tighten food inspections increase security of water supplies widen availability of potassium iodide tighten regulation of toxic agents modernise laboratories increase training for dealing with attacks supplies will be given to authorities within 20 miles -lrb- 32 kilometres -rrb- of a nuclear power plant .
hospitals and public health agencies are to be given $ 1.6bn to receive training and resources to recognize , treat and contain an attack .
the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta are also in line to be modernised - and rules on the possession , use and transfer of over 30 toxic agents have been tightened .
president bush also used the opportunity to press the need for a new government department dealing with domestic security .
" if we 're going to succeed , we need to reorganise our government .
and that 's why i look forward to working with congress to create the department of homeland security , " he said .
congress has been working on the bioterrorism bill since the 11 september attacks on new york and washington , and the process was accelerated after the anthrax attacks shortly afterwards .
suspects transferred the united states , meanwhile , said it transferred 34 more al-qaeda fighters from afghanistan to its detention centre at guantanamo bay , cuba , on wednesday .
this brings to 468 the number of prisoners being held at camp delta .
" today was a good day for us .
we helped get 34 suspected terrorists off the battlefield and out of the fight , " said us army lieutenant colonel joe hoey .
extension work under way at the island naval base will eventually provide space for nearly 2,000 detainees .

many refugees on nauru are seeing their claims rejected the group have been held on nauru since september when the australian government refused to let them land on australian soil .
the united nations high commissioner for refugees says that claims for refugee status by 219 afghan asylum seekers have been rejected .
the high number of rejections reflects the changed situation in afghanistan since the fall of the taleban .
' pacific solution ' the group on nauru come from the 433 people rescued at sea by the norwegian merchant ship , the tampa , last august .
after troops were used to ensure they did not land on australian territory , some were taken in by new zealand .
the asylum seekers arrived in australian waters by boat but the vast majority were transferred to nauru as part of what ministers called the pacific solution .
other asylum seekers followed and in total , more than 1,500 people were sent to nauru and a similar detention centre in papua new guinea .
of the tampa refugees , more than half have now been rejected , and another 25 are still waiting for a ruling .
those whose claims have been rejected can appeal or accept financial incentives from the australian government designed to encourage repatriation .

the brazilian real slumped almost 3 % against the dollar during wednesday 's trading - an extremely heavy fall for a currency .
the confidence of foreign investors has been shaken by the uncertainties surrounding the country 's october elections and doubts about the government 's ability to rollover maturing debts .
but mr cardoso tried to brush aside analogies with crisis-ridden argentina , saying the brazilian authorities were " aware of their responsibility to help macroeconomic conditions function normally " .
" we are convinced of the good fundamentals of our economy and the public responsibility of our political leaders , " he added , speaking on national television .
changing course the popularity of the leftist leader luiz inacio de silva in the polls - and the economic policies he advocates - is thought to be the root of the rising concern .
stable economic policy over the coming months is especially crucial to brazil given its need to rollover debt through to next year .
many investors fear brazil may change its economic course towards a style of more state intervention .
that could further bloat the country 's public debt and alienate international money lenders .
' no cause for alarm ' as well as the currency falls , the country 's risk premium - a key gauge of investor sentiment - soared .
mr cardoso said the market turmoil would be analysed " calmly , serenely and firmly " .
in another move to help soothe investor fears , the senate has also approved the extension of a tax on financial transactions aimed at helping the government avoid a huge potential budget gap .
despite the growing fears over the future , analysts said the fundamentals of the brazilian economy remained changed .
" there is no sense on our part that a sense of alarm is needed , " world bank regional representative david de ferranti said .

the government-funded food watchdog commissioned research that found 71 of 127 normally nut-free everyday products were labelled as having a risk of trace contamination .
it said people were now questioning whether the food suppliers were using it defensively " to cover their backs " .
in the early days , such labelling was considered responsible and helpful to allergic consumers fsa this " blanket insurance policy " severely restricted the choice of even the most basic of food items that people with a nut allergy could buy , it added .
allergies to peanuts , hazelnuts and walnuts are among the most common .
the smallest traces can trigger a fatal reaction .
products whose ingredients may have been transported with nuts or made in the same factory as others could also pose a threat .
as a result food manufacturers and retailers increasingly label products with the vague warning : " may contain traces of nuts " .
the fsa said : " in the early days , such labelling was considered responsible and helpful to allergic consumers .
guidelines " but as the range and number of products labelled in this way increased , consumers began to question whether the food suppliers were using it defensively ' to cover their backs ' . "
head of allergy and food tolerance at the fsa dr catherine boyle said : " using ' may contain ' as a blanket insurance policy has a real impact on nut allergy sufferers as they find their choice of even the most basic of food items significantly restricted . "
she urged manufacturers to " re-examine the labels they are using in light of this report " , adding the fsa would work closely with them to develop " practical and helpful " guidelines .

the royal couple visited newport and spoke to children and former miners in the rhondda , before her majesty is due to deliver a keynote speech at the welsh assembly in cardiff bay .
also on the itinerary are a drive through the shopping centre of bridgend , a visit to the heritage park at trehafod and a reception given by cardiff city council .
on wednesday , the queen opened the millennium coastal park in llanelli , west wales , and attended a festival of youth and community service at margam park , near port talbot .
the royal couple had arrived on anglesey on tuesday , and were cheered by crowds as she carried out a string of engagements across north wales , including a service at bangor cathedral .
but while the rest of the tour has been for the people , the visit to cardiff bay will be the political highlight of the trip .
only ams and their partners have been invited , and first minister rhodri morgan will be taking his 96-year-old mother .
most members will be keen to hear what the queen makes of devolution .
a similar speech to the scottish parliament a fortnight ago proved to be surprisingly political .
in that speech , she praised the new parliamentary body , but urged the scots to give it time .
the queen told members of the parliament that they were strengthening the bonds linking the nations of the united kingdom .
she said people should not rush to instant judgements but respect the hard work of the parliament .
during that visit , seven members of the scottish national party stayed away , although claims of a boycott were denied .
in cardiff , seven out of the 60 ams are expected not to attend .
some are away or abroad , while others have not given a reason for their absence .

the problems affected pupils ' completed exam papers .
the sqa has been using a new contractor to send the scripts to nearly 9,000 markers .
however , some markers said problems had arisen when delivery could not be made because no-one was at home .

the authority said all the scripts have now been delivered and that the marking process is well ahead of schedule .
a quarter of the one million scripts completed by scottish pupils should have been dealt with by this stage , but more than a half have already been marked .
that is in sharp contrast to the sqa 's response in 2000 - when thousands of results were late or wrong .
the swift response this year has won praise from parents ' and teachers ' leaders .

further action is required from all nations - individually and collectively - to sustain a truly effective global offensive against terrorism g8 statement " i 'm quite pleased at the seriousness with which my g8 colleagues continue to take the campaign against terrorism - the coalition remains united , " us secretary of state colin powell said at a two-day meeting at the canadian ski resort of whistler .
the ministers also pledged to help smaller countries in the anti-terrorism campaign .
" further action is required from all nations - individually and collectively - to sustain a truly effective global offensive against terrorism , " the ministers said in a statement .
reporting from whistler , the bbc 's jon leyne says this could include anything from training airport security staff to help redrafting laws .
he says the ministers also apparently came close to an agreed definition of terrorism - something which has eluded the international community for many decades .
the talks - the first major meeting of g8 ministers since the attacks on the us last september - are part of preparations for a g8 summit due to take place later this month in another canadian resort .
diplomatic push the ministers gave themselves a glowing report card on what had been achieved so far in their combined efforts to fight global terrorism .
very few protesters have gathered at the meeting " our goal is to ensure that terrorists attacks like the one on the 11 september will never happen again , " the report said .
the ministers praised as a very positive sign the recent steps by india to reduce the tension in its confrontation with pakistan over the disputed region of kashmir .
but they are keeping pressure on both countries , saying there could be no repeat of the stand-off , even as the tensions appear to ease .
" there was absolute agreement that we do n't want to go through this again , " mr powell said .
the host of the meeting , canadian foreign minister bill graham , may be sent to the region immediately following the meetings as a show of the g8 's concern over kashmir .
the middle east conflict is also high on the agenda , but correspondents say canadian officials are playing down expectations of concrete action from the g8 , suggesting the us has little appetite for another international initiative while its own efforts continue .
small protest this luxury isolated mountain retreat was chosen in part because of the threat of noisy anti-globalisation protests .
canadian police are maintaining a visible presence here , but so far fewer than 50 protesters have arrived outside on a pair of hired buses .
they stood in their officially appointed place beside an open gate , chanting occasionally , almost outnumbered by the media .
to their evident surprise , two protesters were eventually allowed inside the security cordon and were granted a brief meeting with mr graham .
they told the minister of their vision of what the world 's most powerful diplomats should be discussing : human rights , third world poverty and environmental degradation .
the g8 consists of canada , britain , france , italy , germany , japan , the united states and russia . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jon leyne " they have come to this idyllic mountain resort to tackle the world 's troubles " tackling world poverty key stories peanuts or progress ?

"
further action is required from all nations - individually and collectively - to sustain a truly effective global offensive against terrorism " g8 statement " i 'm quite pleased at the seriousness with which my g8 colleagues continue to take the campaign against terrorism - the coalition remains united , " us secretary of state colin powell said at a two-day meeting at the canadian ski resort of whistler .
the ministers also pledged to help smaller countries in the anti-terrorism campaign .
" further action is required from all nations - individually and collectively - to sustain a truly effective global offensive against terrorism , " the ministers said in a statement .
reporting from whistler , the bbc 's jon leyne says this could include anything from training airport security staff to help redrafting laws .
he says the ministers also apparently came close to an agreed definition of terrorism - something which has eluded the international community for many decades .
the talks - the first major meeting of g8 ministers since the attacks on the us last september - are part of preparations for a g8 summit due to take place later this month in another canadian resort .
diplomatic push the ministers gave themselves a glowing report card on what had been achieved so far in their combined efforts to fight global terrorism .
" our goal is to ensure that terrorists attacks like the one on the 11 september will never happen again , " the report said .
the ministers praised as a very positive sign the recent steps by india to reduce the tension in its confrontation with pakistan over the disputed region of kashmir .
but they are keeping pressure on both countries , saying there could be no repeat of the stand-off , even as the tensions appear to ease .
" there was absolute agreement that we do n't want to go through this again , " mr powell said .
the host of the meeting , canadian foreign minister bill graham , may be sent to the region immediately following the meetings as a show of the g8 's concern over kashmir .
the middle east conflict is also high on the agenda , but correspondents say canadian officials are playing down expectations of concrete action from the g8 , suggesting the us has little appetite for another international initiative while its own efforts continue .
small protest this luxury isolated mountain retreat was chosen in part because of the threat of noisy anti-globalisation protests .
canadian police are maintaining a visible presence here , but so far fewer than 50 protesters have arrived outside on a pair of hired buses .
they stood in their officially appointed place beside an open gate , chanting occasionally , almost outnumbered by the media .
to their evident surprise , two protesters were eventually allowed inside the security cordon and were granted a brief meeting with mr graham .
they told the minister of their vision of what the world 's most powerful diplomats should be discussing : human rights , third world poverty and environmental degradation .
the g8 consists of canada , britain , france , italy , germany , japan , the united states and russia .

graham reeves , 70 , died five weeks after having a health kidney removed during an operation at prince philip hospital in llanelli in january 2000 . "
she told mr goel that she thought it was the right kidney was not functioning and the left one was compensating for it " leighton davies qc consultant urologist john roberts , 60 , from ty coch , swansea , and surgeon mahesh chard goel , 40 , from burnley , lancashire , have denied manslaughter .
on wednesday cardiff crown court heard how a " fateful chain of events " led to mr reeves 's death .
the jury was told how a medical student had warned mr goel - who performed the operation - that he was taking out the wrong kidney .
the court was told that victoria fern spoke to mr goel during the operation after studying the x-rays on the wall of the operating theatre .
opening the case for the prosecution , leighton davies qc , said : " she told mr goel that she thought it was the right kidney was not functioning and the left one was compensating for it .
" mr goel told her she had got it wrong .
but she had n't got it wrong at all . "
the court heard that by the time the error had been discovered the healthy kidney had been put in a jar of sterilising agent - and could never be used .
the jury was told that wrong kidney had been identified on an admittance slip when mr reeves arrived at the hospital .
the incorrect information was then put on the operating theatre list - even though his case notes and consent form had the correct information .
consultant mr roberts who was overseeing the operation said he was going to check the case notes .
but the prosecution claimed all that he did was glance at the admittance form which detailed the wrong kidney .
after it was obvious the blunder had happened , mr davies said mr roberts wrote in his notes : " wrong kidney removed .
x-rays checked sometime by me but still wrong procedure . "
in another memo written later he wrote : " did not check the notes , " the court was told .
mr davies said : " mr reeves must have thought he was over the worst but mr roberts then explained that a mistake had been made . "
mr reeves , a korean war veteran from burry port , then agreed to a second operation in which mr roberts tried to get the diseased kidney to work .
however after that operation mr reeves ' condition deteriorated and he died on 1 march at morriston hospital in swansea .
" the ultimate and over-riding duty to ensure the correct operation is performed rests with the operating surgeon and the supervising surgeon , " he told the jury .
" they can not delegate this awesome responsibility to others down the line .
" the organ grinder can not blame the monkey .
their duty is to ensure the correct operation is performed and the buck stops with them . "
" these defendants breached this high duty of making sure that the correct side of mr reeves was operated on , " he said .
the trial continues .

the 43-year-old scot had agreed to leave the house at a time that suited the show 's producers , after telling everyone he was bored .
but after climbing onto the roof on wednesday to make an early dash for freedom , he was persuaded to come down by programme producers who then let him walk out the back door of the house . "
i know i was not getting anything out of it " sandy cumming speaking after his departure , he denied he was a " quitter " who had prevented someone else taking part in the experience , but he did not see any point in staying .
" i saw a loophole in the set-up and i decided when i got bored it was time to go over the wall .
it was the most exciting thing that happened in the house , " said mr cumming .
meanwhile , jade goody has been banned from nominating any of the other housemates for eviction .
she was punished after discussing her reasons for past nominations with other housemates , something which is banned by the show .
she can , however , still be nominated in next week 's round of nominations .
mr cumming said he was adamant he would not miss any of his fellow contestants .
" they 're called house mates but actually they 're not your house mates .
they are there for a reason , at the end of the day it 's a game show , " he said .
his dramatic early departure left show producers with a dilemma of what to do with him .
no preconceptions mr cumming , a personal shopper , was taken to a secret location to meet up with his wife claire .
a special edition of spin-off show big brother 's little brother was recorded with presenter dermot o 'leary questioning mr cumming on his reasons for leaving .
" i went on to the show with no preconceptions .
i did what i feel was right and left when i felt it was right to leave , " he said .
" i actually do n't think you 're under pressure .
you have got to have some kind of stimulation and it got to the stage , if there 's no stimulation then something gives .
i know i was not getting anything out of it . "
the show 's bosses now face the option of whether or not to replace him .
trainee barrister sunita sharma , 25 , was the first british contestant to voluntarily leave the show when she walked out of the house nearly two weeks ago to be replaced by sophie pritchard .
cup fever mr cumming 's departure was not the only big event of wednesday morning , with the housemates allowed to watch 25 minutes of the england v nigeria world cup match .
the girls had earned one minute per " keepy-up " in a task , kicking a ball in the air without letting it touch the ground .
after 25 minutes of the tense but unentertaining match , the screen went blank and the tired-looking contestants returned to bed .
meanwhile , contestants jonny regan and lee davey were coming to terms with being nominated for eviction .
official bookmaker ladbrokes makes lee the 1-4 favourite to be evicted on friday with jonny at 11-4 .

the uk managing director of ikea , göran nilsson , talks to bbc news online about doing things " the ikea way " .
" gotland .
there is a mythical feeling .
out there , in the middle of the baltic sea . "
so says the poem pasted on the wall at ikea 's corporate uk headquarters in brent .
ikea fact pack first store opened in 1987 annual uk revenue : £ 885-900m -lrb- 1.4bn euros -rrb- like-for-like annual growth : 10 % 11 stores in the uk with 6,500 employees 70 % of customers are female , aged 38-42 the company is privately owned click here to see ikea 's group turnover apparently , this mythical place -lrb- gotland , not brent -rrb- was also where " the vikings hired their pathfinders to the unknown east 1,100 years ago " .
speed forward more than 10 centuries - and the latest arrival from sweden has been the retailer of fashionable furnishings .
beech-wood wall systems and glass-door cabinets are no doubt a welcome relief after the rape and pillage of the 10th century .
but just as before , the scandinavians are determined to ring in a few changes .
" we are a bank of inspiration on how to make the home in a better , more organised way , " says göran nilsson , the uk 's managing director .
they came and they conquered since the first british store opened in 1987 , shopping at ikea has become a familiar part of domestic life .
" people like the simplicity and versatility of their design , and the sheer cleverness of it , " says gary davies , professor of corporate reputation at manchester business school .
quirky adverts , unbearable traffic jams , flat packs and undecipherable instructions are all part of the experience .
the market is screaming for us göran nilsson ikea the retailer timed its entry into the uk market perfectly , just as the craze for home furnishings was getting underway .
" it was luck and coincidence that we came in then , " says mr nilsson .
during the past few years , the furniture and diy segment of the market has experienced incredible growth , even for the buoyant retail sector .
however , with many predicting the end of the housing boom , ikea could soon be facing a different climate .
a significant proportion of diy and furniture sales are generated by people moving house and credit-happy consumers .
if people rein back on their debts and stop moving house , the sector could be hit by a " double whammy " , warns hugh phillips , professor of retailing at bournemouth university .
' teething problems ' ironically , in early days , ikea had the opposite problem .
storage solutions , the ikea way having introduced the british public to good-value furniture , it then struggled to cope with a tidal wave of demand .
the complexities of uk planning law have also thwarted the company 's ambitious expansion programme .
since announcing its plans two years ago to open 20 stores in 10 years , ikea has only managed to launch one in glasgow .
" the market is screaming for us , " says mr nilsson , who is frustrated by the delay .
" ikea wants to make a tremendous investment in the uk and the money is in the bank .
" but if we ca n't expand here , -lsb- the money -rsb- will go elsewhere . "
time for a re-launch ?
ikea is also desperate to take the pressure off existing stores .
göran nilsson born in götenborg in 1958 married with two children worked for ikea in canada , italy and sweden moved to the uk in 1998 at home , he has designer furniture from italy , antiques and ikea supports sven-goran eriksson and the england team -lrb- " people in sweden will kill me " -rrb- " the brent store is 45 % too small compared to its turnover , " mr nilsson says , explaining that this leads to products being out of stock .
but for all its " teething problems " , mr nilsson maintains that things have improved .
ikea is even planning a re-launch in the uk to draw attention to its investment in new computer systems , different lay-outs and an increasing number of tills .
in a year 's time , the company will also start selling its goods over the internet and through its call centre .
laid-back mr nilsson , who came to run the uk operation in 1998 , is not daunted by any dip in consumer confidence .
" we always take more market share during a downturn , " he says .
ikea earns most of its revenues in europe to some extent , professor phillips agrees .
" ikea will take a hit , but they are probably more resilient than most because they offer good value for money . "
this is a point that mr nilsson likes to labour , as well as his mission to work in " partnership " with his customers to improve their homes .
for a straight-talking swede , he has certainly bought into ikea 's deliberate socialisation of shopping .
number one ?
ikea 's winning formula has seen it become the biggest furniture retailer in the uk , in front of mfi and dfs .
mr nilsson also claims to be unperturbed by marks & spencer 's return to the home-furnishings business .
ikea , which has dropped its prices by 15 % in the last three years , believes it could win a price war with the rejuvenated british brand .
but ikea 's biggest challenge could be still to come .
its achievement to date has been to assimilate its swedish design so ubiquitously into the british household .
if spending on the home eventually falls out of favour , the company will have to work harder to keep its customers coming back for more .

the uk managing director of ikea , göran nilsson , talks to bbc news online about doing things " the ikea way " .
" gotland .
there is a mythical feeling .
out there , in the middle of the baltic sea . "
so says the poem pasted on the wall at ikea 's corporate uk headquarters in brent .
ikea fact pack first store opened in 1987 annual uk revenue : £ 885-900m -lrb- 1.4bn euros -rrb- like-for-like annual growth : 10 % 11 stores in the uk with 6,500 employees 70 % of customers are female , aged 38-42 the company is privately owned apparently , this mythical place -lrb- gotland , not brent -rrb- was also where " the vikings hired their pathfinders to the unknown east 1,100 years ago " .
speed forward more than 10 centuries - and the latest arrival from sweden has been the retailer of fashionable furnishings .
beech-wood wall systems and glass-door cabinets are no doubt a welcome relief after the rape and pillage of the 10th century .
but just as before , the scandinavians are determined to ring in a few changes .
" we are a bank of inspiration on how to make the home in a better , more organised way , " says göran nilsson , the uk 's managing director .
they came and they conquered since the first british store opened in 1987 , shopping at ikea has become a familiar part of domestic life .
" people like the simplicity and versatility of their design , and the sheer cleverness of it , " says gary davies , professor of corporate reputation at manchester business school .
quirky adverts , unbearable traffic jams , flat packs and undecipherable instructions are all part of the experience . "
the market is screaming for us " göran nilsson ikea the retailer timed its entry into the uk market perfectly , just as the craze for home furnishings was getting underway .
" it was luck and coincidence that we came in then , " says mr nilsson .
during the past few years , the furniture and diy segment of the market has experienced incredible growth , even for the buoyant retail sector .
however , with many predicting the end of the housing boom , ikea could soon be facing a different climate .
a significant proportion of diy and furniture sales are generated by people moving house and credit-happy consumers .
if people rein back on their debts and stop moving house , the sector could be hit by a " double whammy " , warns hugh phillips , professor of retailing at bournemouth university .
' teething problems ' ironically , in early days , ikea had the opposite problem .
having introduced the british public to good-value furniture , it then struggled to cope with a tidal wave of demand .
the complexities of uk planning law have also thwarted the company 's ambitious expansion programme .
since announcing its plans two years ago to open 20 stores in 10 years , ikea has only managed to launch one in glasgow .
" the market is screaming for us , " says mr nilsson , who is frustrated by the delay .
" ikea wants to make a tremendous investment in the uk and the money is in the bank .
" but if we ca n't expand here , -lsb- the money -rsb- will go elsewhere . "
time for a re-launch ?
ikea is also desperate to take the pressure off existing stores .
göran nilsson born in götenborg in 1958 married with two children worked for ikea in canada , italy and sweden moved to the uk in 1998 at home , he has designer furniture from italy , antiques and ikea supports sven-goran eriksson and the england team -lrb- " people in sweden will kill me " -rrb- " the brent store is 45 % too small compared to its turnover , " mr nilsson says , explaining that this leads to products being out of stock .
but for all its " teething problems " , mr nilsson maintains that things have improved .
ikea is even planning a re-launch in the uk to draw attention to its investment in new computer systems , different lay-outs and an increasing number of tills .
in a year 's time , the company will also start selling its goods over the internet and through its call centre .
laid-back mr nilsson , who came to run the uk operation in 1998 , is not daunted by any dip in consumer confidence .
" we always take more market share during a downturn , " he says .
to some extent , professor phillips agrees .
" ikea will take a hit , but they are probably more resilient than most because they offer good value for money . "
this is a point that mr nilsson likes to labour , as well as his mission to work in " partnership " with his customers to improve their homes .
for a straight-talking swede , he has certainly bought into ikea 's deliberate socialisation of shopping .
number one ?
ikea 's winning formula has seen it become the biggest furniture retailer in the uk , in front of mfi and dfs .
mr nilsson also claims to be unperturbed by marks & spencer 's return to the home-furnishings business .
ikea , which has dropped its prices by 15 % in the last three years , believes it could win a price war with the rejuvenated british brand .
but ikea 's biggest challenge could be still to come .
its achievement to date has been to assimilate its swedish design so ubiquitously into the british household .
if spending on the home eventually falls out of favour , the company will have to work harder to keep its customers coming back for more .

according to ministers , the deal " is good news for nhs patients and for nhs consultants " .
according to the bma , it " is fair to consultants and fair to the nhs " .
however , the government has already been accused of backtracking on key promises , not least its pledge to ban newly-qualified consultants from doing private work .
the continuing working in the private sector has had a damaging effect on the interests of patients david hinchliffe mp others have warned that the deal - due to come into effect in april 2003 - offers generous financial terms to doctors without any guarantee of improvements in hospitals across the country .
these generous terms - a 20 % increase in the starting pay of consultants - also prompted quick calls from unions for similar increases for nurses and other professionals working in the health service .
private fears for their part , ministers have moved quickly to play down suggestions they backtracked on introducing a private practice ban .
under the deal , newly-qualified consultants will have to work 48 hours per week for the nhs before they can run private clinics .
similarly , existing consultants will have to work 44 hours per week before they can treat patients privately .
health secretary alan milburn said : " for the first time it will be explicitly part of the consultants ' contract of employment that nhs patients come first and the nhs always has first call on consultants ' time . "
however , these measures do not constitute the ban on private practice first proposed by ministers in the nhs plan in july 2000 and reiterated as recently as one month ago .
under those proposals , ministers wanted to prevent every newly-qualified consultant from working in the private sector for at least seven years .
nhs consultants will get more - but only if nhs patients get more health secretary alan milburn these doctors would , ministers said , be rewarded with a £ 10,000 boost in annual pay when they took up their posts followed by a further £ 10,000 hike after seven years .
the contract , agreed between the department of health and the bma , makes no reference to a private practice ban .
it does , however , promise to boost the basic starting salary of consultants from £ 52,640 to £ 63,000 .
over the past two years , ministers have said the ban was needed to prevent doctors from abusing the nhs - namely by treating private patients when in fact they should be working for the health service .
they also saw the ban as a way of ensuring the state got value out of the doctors it spends millions training .
but doctors were strongly against the idea .
the categorically denied allegations that they abused the nhs and bma negotiators consistently said they would never countenance signing up to the ban .
meanwhile , lawyers suggested the ban may be unworkable since it could be seen to violate a doctors ' human rights by dictating where and how they work .
political support nevertheless support for the ban was strong on government backbenches .
labour mp david hinchliffe and chairman of the commons health committee criticised the government 's failure to impose the ban .
he said : " i would like to have seen not just a seven year commitment but a permanent commitment for nhs consultants to work full time in the nhs and to be properly rewarded for actually doing so .
the big risk with this contract is that doctors will get a significant increase in pay and the nhs will not get any increase in activity or quality of work professor alan maynard , university of york " i think the continuing working in the private sector has had a damaging effect on the interests of patients . "
doctors are adamant that the contract , which will boost their pay and reduce their working hours , is long overdue .
dr peter hawker , chairman of the bma 's consultants committee said : " the new contract will offer consultants some control over their workload .
it recognises just how much hidden work they do at nights and weekends and offers them a reward for that commitment . "
mr milburn echoed that view .
" it offers more pay for nhs consultants so that more nhs patients benefit from more of their precious time and skills , " he said .
however , professor alan maynard of the university of york warned that the extra pay for consultants must be accompanied with new checks on the work they are doing for the nhs .
" there are enormous variations in the amount of work consultants do in the nhs and we do n't really know why there is that enormous variation , " he said .
" the big risk with this contract is that doctors will get a significant increase in pay and the nhs will not get any increase in activity or quality of work they do .
" if they are paid more there should be demonstrable improvements in the quality and quantity of their work . "
financial floodgates the terms of this contract - which will bring the annual pay bill for consultants above £ 2bn - have been agreed with chancellor gordon brown .
however , it may already be causing concern inside the treasury .
nurses and other groups have been quick to use this deal to demand their own pay increases .
upon hearing details of the consultants ' contract , beverly malone , general secretary of the royal college of nursing said : " nurses will now have high expectations of their own pay and career modernisation . "
she added : " the government has delivered for doctors - they now have to deliver for nurses . "
dave prentis , general secretary of unison , said : " the new starting salary raises the benchmark for nhs pay . "
there can be little doubt that the impact of this new contract will be watched carefully both inside and outside government .
ministers presumably hope this contract will help to ensure the extra billions promised for the nhs over the coming years will produce visible improvements on the ground .
mr milburn insists it will .
" these are fundamental and far reaching changes to how nhs consultants are employed , rewarded and managed .
" nhs consultants will get more - but only if nhs patients get more . "
for the time being at least , all sides appear to be content .

staff at the main control centre in swanwick , hampshire , are making more than twice as many official complaints about their workload than this time last year , it has emerged .
the " overload reports " are completed whenever controllers think planes may have been put at risk because they were dealing with too many aircraft in too short a space of time .

karl schneider , the editor of computer weekly which first revealed the figures , told bbc radio 4 's today programme the reports nevertheless indicated increasing potential for serious safety problems .
" this does show that the number of situations in which it 's increasingly likely that those sort of near-misses occur , has gone up .

he said the main indicator of safety was the number of " airprox reports " , where aircraft pass close to one another .

" the number of situations in which it 's increasingly likely that ... near-misses occur , has gone up " computer weekly editor karl schneider he added that in the last five years , 160 overloads had been filed - but only five of those were actually associated with " loss of separation " -lrb- when one aircraft enters the protected space surrounding another -rrb- .

for them it is an expensive business that takes huge amounts of time , energy and money to keep up with .
to make matters worse , before now most have struggled to find ways to offset this expense by getting gamers to pay for the services they enjoy .
but as broadband net connections become more popular and more people play online , some games sites are starting to experiment with new ways to make gaming pay .
big bills like almost every web-centred business , it has been a hard 18 months for websites and companies who make it possible to play online games .
funds for expansion , or simple survival , have been hard to find and new sources of income have been even scarcer .
although any firm that has survived has less competition , they are finding it hard to make money out of gamers because they have got used to getting everything , apart from the game itself , for free .
click here to tell us if you would pay to play it did not used to be like this .
rick walker , aka sky from games portal challenge uk , said keen online gamers used to have to be rich to indulge their hobby .
potential customers are loathe to pay still more to play games , especially when they can play for free elsewhere rick walker , challenge uk " it was n't uncommon for some of the top quake players to have phone bills in excess of £ 600 for a quarter , " he said .
but with the advent of unmetered web surfing and cheap broadband , online gaming is getting more popular .
now it is not just the preserve of a dedicated few .
" it has led to a rise in the number of ' casual ' gamers , " said mr walker .
" they might not join a team or compete in a competition , but they 'll still play on public servers . "
boom and bust the booming popularity is causing headaches for both gamers and companies .
for the top games , it can be hard for players to find a public server with free places .
quake can be a costly habit for the games companies , public servers are an expense for which they get little in return , apart from the goodwill of gamers .
" the problem with the net community is that they do not understand the real costs of online gaming , " said dave evans , new media director at barrysworld , a popular gaming portal rescued from liquidation last year by retailer game .
gradually both players and game portal owners are realising that , if online gaming is to survive and expand , something has to change .
now all the operators of the uk 's larger games portals , barrysworld , telewest and bt , are experimenting with pay-to-play systems .
" the barrysworld community is pretty sophisticated and everyone is aware that this is going to happen , " said mr evans .
pay-to-play involves a small monthly or annual fee for which subscribers get guaranteed places to play , access to bookable servers for their own games , the latest updates and special events .
these subscription services have been proved to work for games set in massive online worlds such as ultima , everquest and star wars galaxies .
fan furore but there is debate over whether it will work for games such as counter-strike , quake , unreal and return to castle wolfenstein that have huge online followings outside the control of one company .
online games like star wars galaxies make money " potential customers are already paying for their connection , and are loathe to pay still more to play games , especially when they can play for free elsewhere , " said mr walker from challenge uk .
" the recent furore over the big brother video streams is an example of the sort of response the public might give , " he said .
but the games sites do need a way to recoup some cash from the growing ranks of casual gamers rather than the dedicated fans .
" if all the service providers are chasing the existing fans , there 's not enough business for us all , " said mr evans from barrysworld .
" we need fresh players . "
the pay-to-play trials show how tentative any changes will be , largely because no-one wants to get it wrong .
" maybe we will introduce some sort of ' gold account ' with special features for a monthly fee , " said willem bisson , president of the clanbase website , " but we do n't want to be the first to try that out in the gaming world . "
but if nothing changes , it could be game over for everyone .
click here to return would you pay to play online ?
is there a way to make money out of online gaming ?
i have played pay-to-play games -lsb- in the end i only played asherons call -rsb- before , and for those rich multiplayer " living " worlds i am happy to pay £ 10 a month of my hard earned cash .
however , the quake / counter-strike / wolfenstein shooter games , i would not pay .
a new pricing model -lrb- and access model -rrb- is needed , perhaps £ 15 for the software , and the ability to play for free but not advance your character , so you can look at the world , get used to it and decide if the game is to your taste or not mark borton , uk i am not totally against paying .
however i do n't think it should be general charge for all .
i do n't think the majority of users on a 56k connection should be charged , basically because the quality of gaming is pretty poor .
others on a broadband or cable connection where the standard of game performance is much higher and can be almost guaranteed , i 'm sure most would pay a small charge , as long as the service being provided had an adequate variety of games .
rob , uk the only online game i have ever played is hearts .
i am thinking about playing the star wars game and maybe everquest or something like that .
i 'd be prepared to pay a subscription per month for that .
as long as it is n't too expensive .
morgan , nz if i was interested enough in a game , yes , i 'd pay-to-play .
it 'd have to be really good , though , as it 's much easier and cheaper for me to play on a local area network , even paying in a cybercafe , than it would be to play online .
with ireland 's metered access , i 'd be paying twice - once for the connection , and once for the game .
drew shiel , ireland i already pay every month for ac -lrb- $ 9.99 -rrb- and in addition to the internet connection -lrb- adsl -rrb- i find it a good investment in entertainment when compared with a night at the cinema , or going out to dinner for example .
like mark , i personally would n't pay a lot for first person shooters online , but perhaps i would pay a subscription to an umbrella company which enabled me to pick and choose which of these games i wanted to play for my money .
in my mind we should be paying for what is a great service and investment in hours of entertainment .
m sterling , uk i 've been playing online fps games since 1997 for free but recently my clan -lrb- team -rrb- has started paying for various facilities .
we rent our own server and also pay a small fee to play in various leagues and cups .
we 're quite happy with this since we 're getting a more interesting gaming experience than just playing on the free servers .
pete , england i have played and paid for online chess .
the trouble with free servers is a lot of people cheat and use computer programmes to win .
i do n't mind paying £ 10 a month if the overall experience is good i.e. gameplay and the players themselves play in the true spirit of the game .
john mcaree , uk i 'm not really rich , i can afford to pay for my cable modem internet access , but to me that $ 40 a month is paying for gaming .
ben , usa i would only pay up to £ 10 a month for online gaming because games are expensive enough as it is .
james , uk i 've never paid to play online , except for isp fees of course , and i never will .
paying to play for games such as the quake series and its modifications is impossible and will never happen on a large scale .
it 's too easy to find free public servers .
as long as there are communities out there that support them , that 's where i 'll be playing .
karr , canada i 'm thinking what is the point of broadband users paying extra for the gaming ?
i mean broadband is generally bought for faster gaming and nothing more .
come on , do n't we pay enough for fast connections already ?
stuart turner , england the big difference here is that games like ultima online and the forthcoming star wars galaxies use the monthly charge to expand and evolve the game further for the players .
in contrast , games like counterstrike do n't develop as you play them , you are simply utilising the server space .
i think the games companies are going to have to add something extra to games of this genre if they want people to seriously consider paying for the service .
matt , uk i would pay , but if i did i would expect fast servers with adequate capacity , and the swift removal of cheating players .
currently gamers put up with the lack of these facilities , because playing is free .
i doubt they would be so tolerant if they were paying .

now my son 's going . '
alan stuttle : " i never thought she 'd die before me " two months ago alan stuttle 's daughter caroline was killed while backpacking in australia , but the york-based artist has still given his son his blessing to go to new zealand .
mr stuttle is also planning a trip , to retrace caroline 's last steps .
i 'm a father who has a daughter who 's been murdered but i do n't want that to cloud anybody 's judgement about letting their children go abroad .
caroline died two months into her gap year trip if you love your children , you have to let them go at some point .
and before they go out the door , do n't forget to say ' i love you ' and give them a hug and a kiss .
i 'm very pleased that i did that for caroline before she went away .
i gave her a bon voyage card that said that one of my dreams had always been to have a wonderful daughter .
as she left , she beamed across the road at me and i remember feeling so happy that she was having a go .
farewell down under i hope to go to australia myself in the next couple of weeks , to draw a line under the last chapter and to say goodbye to my daughter .
alan 's portrait of richard and caroline as children she loved australia .
in her e-mails and text messages and postcards she was so full of the places she 'd been , the beautiful things she 'd seen .
so i 'd like to see it through her eyes .
i want to paint the things she saw , to visually express the love she felt for that country .
i want to see what her last views of this earth were like .
i 'll also work on a book about her life and what it 's like to grieve for a child .
if i can commit this to paper , perhaps it 'll help another bereaved parent .
death down under caroline fell or was pushed off a bridge during a robbery in bundaberg , north queensland when caroline died , many people who have had their children taken from them wrote to offer their sympathy and support .
an old friend who had never spoken of his loss before offered me his hand and said : ' i 'm so sorry , alan , that this terrible thing has happened .
all i can tell you is that 20 years ago my daughter was going to go to university and she just disappeared . '
every time he hears of a body being discovered , he thinks it may be her .
my daughter was brutally murdered but at least i know where she is .
he does n't know where his child is and that must be terrible .
feel the fear now my son richard is planning to go to new zealand , having just come back from working in france over the winter .
he 's a chef and he likes to travel and work with different cuisines .
he 's a talented young man and we have to encourage him .
alan wants to paint the australia his daughter saw i was very much the same when i was young - i had to go to america , i had to paint here , there and everywhere .
in my time it was n't the thing you did - you had a job and you stopped in the job for 40 years and then you had a very good pension .
at 28 i 'd decided that i did n't want to be a lecturer at an art college for the next 30 years , so i went off to paint .
i am frightened of letting richard go , i 'd like to keep him .
but you ca n't keep your children safe forever ; they have to have their freedom .
if you let them go , they will come back to you very much matured - as caroline would have done had she not met that terrible fate .
real time gives people a chance to tell their own stories in their own words .
if you 've got something to say , click here . watch / listen on this story alan stuttle " we ca n't protect our children forever - they must have their freedom " tales of real life , every thursday love at blind date ball my job ?
