the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .

the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 18.09.2002 women 's issues a focus in german election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can she continue working after having a baby ? - a question for german politicians as election fever heats up in germany , political parties are wooing the substantial group of women voters with policies to help juggle kids and career .
it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .
but which government that will be after this sunday , might well be led by the party that was able to convince germany ’ s women voters it has their best interests in mind . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the politics of raising children family issues are high on the agenda for germany ’ s politicians .

the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .

it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .

the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .
but the most important resident of the new concert hall is the dortmund philharmonic orchestra , whose musicians are already celebrating their new home – the first regular venue in the musicians ' 110 year history . carsten hinrichs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .

it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .
but which government that will be after this sunday , might well be led by the party that was able to convince germany ’ s women voters it has their best interests in mind . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the politics of raising children family issues are high on the agenda for germany ’ s politicians .

the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .

and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .
but which government that will be after this sunday , might well be led by the party that was able to convince germany ’ s women voters it has their best interests in mind . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the politics of raising children family issues are high on the agenda for germany ’ s politicians .

it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.09.2002 dortmund goes high brow , low brow with new concert hall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pearl of the night : the new home of dortmund 's philharmonic orchestra .
the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .
but the most important resident of the new concert hall is the dortmund philharmonic orchestra , whose musicians are already celebrating their new home – the first regular venue in the musicians ' 110 year history . carsten hinrichs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

on wednesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed concern that the united states could launch unilateral action against iraq despite baghdad ’ s recent decision to permit inspections .
" despite the current developments , war remains the great danger .
such a war would lead to harsh and unpredictable consequences for the whole middle east , " fischer told german public broadcaster zdf .
" the great concern that remains is that there could still be unilateral measures " .
international and national criticism meanwhile , criticism in the u.s. has grown over germany ’ s go-it-alone attitude in the iraq issue .
on tuesday , the washington post accused germany of sacrificing its " international prestige and influence " in a bid to gain left-wing voters in the run-up to the elections .
" the enhanced role in international security he -lrb- schröder -rrb- has sought for his country will crumble as germany sits timidly on the sidelines , watching while its allies face up to a challenge that the chancellor cynically has ducked " , the newspaper warned .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the us -rrb- in order to gain a few seats " .
" germany has lost all influence through the chancellor ’ s remarkable isolationism " , he said .
sharp criticism also came from within germany , led by opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber .

ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce warned in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " it is not worth sacrificing something as precious as the german-american relationship for short-term interests " .
" the german economy relies on the good relationship to the u.s. , they are our most important market overseas and our most important partner in world trade " , he said .
in the firing line the german chancellor has come in the firing line since he defied america by opposing u.s. military action against iraq , even if it were backed by a un security council resolution .
schröder has told election crowds in various parts of the country that he refuses to " click his heels " and say yes to whatever america demands .
he has justified his position with repeated warnings of an escalation of the middle east conflict , if the u.s. attacked iraq .
in germany , voters have welcomed his approach .
polls surged for the ruling coalition by 3 per cent last week .
on wednesday , forsa showed a slim lead for schröder ’ s social democrats over stoiber ’ s opposition conservatives of 40 to 38 per cent .
schröder has used his tough stance in the iraq issue and his skilful handling of the devastating august floods in eastern germany to deflect attention from germany ’ s weak economy .
on tuesday , schröder was quick to claim iraq ’ s offer as vindication of germany ’ s insistence on diplomatic pressure through the united nations .

schröder has told election crowds in various parts of the country that he refuses to " click his heels " and say yes to whatever america demands .
he has justified his position with repeated warnings of an escalation of the middle east conflict , if the u.s. attacked iraq .
in germany , voters have welcomed his approach .
polls surged for the ruling coalition by 3 per cent last week .
on wednesday , forsa showed a slim lead for schröder ’ s social democrats over stoiber ’ s opposition conservatives of 40 to 38 per cent .
schröder has used his tough stance in the iraq issue and his skilful handling of the devastating august floods in eastern germany to deflect attention from germany ’ s weak economy .
on tuesday , schröder was quick to claim iraq ’ s offer as vindication of germany ’ s insistence on diplomatic pressure through the united nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 18.09.2002 women 's issues a focus in german election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can she continue working after having a baby ? - a question for german politicians as election fever heats up in germany , political parties are wooing the substantial group of women voters with policies to help juggle kids and career .
it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .
but which government that will be after this sunday , might well be led by the party that was able to convince germany ’ s women voters it has their best interests in mind . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the politics of raising children family issues are high on the agenda for germany ’ s politicians .
with the national election in mind , chancellor candidates schröder and stoiber are rushing to prove how family friendly their party platform is -lrb- april 2 , 2002 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.09.2002 dortmund goes high brow , low brow with new concert hall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pearl of the night : the new home of dortmund 's philharmonic orchestra .
the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .
but the most important resident of the new concert hall is the dortmund philharmonic orchestra , whose musicians are already celebrating their new home – the first regular venue in the musicians ' 110 year history . carsten hinrichs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

on wednesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed concern that the united states could launch unilateral action against iraq despite baghdad ’ s recent decision to permit inspections .
" despite the current developments , war remains the great danger .
such a war would lead to harsh and unpredictable consequences for the whole middle east , " fischer told german public broadcaster zdf .
" the great concern that remains is that there could still be unilateral measures " .
international and national criticism meanwhile , criticism in the u.s. has grown over germany ’ s go-it-alone attitude in the iraq issue .
on tuesday , the washington post accused germany of sacrificing its " international prestige and influence " in a bid to gain left-wing voters in the run-up to the elections .
" the enhanced role in international security he -lrb- schröder -rrb- has sought for his country will crumble as germany sits timidly on the sidelines , watching while its allies face up to a challenge that the chancellor cynically has ducked " , the newspaper warned .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the us -rrb- in order to gain a few seats " .
" germany has lost all influence through the chancellor ’ s remarkable isolationism " , he said .
sharp criticism also came from within germany , led by opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber .
with iraq ’ s offer to let weapons inspectors back into the country , schröder ’ s iraq policy " collapsed over night " , stoiber announced at an election campaign party rally .
former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher accused schröder of isolating germany in the daily tabloid bild .
saddam hussein ’ s decision to let inspectors back into iraq showed that international pressure was the " only language " the dictator understood .
" no one can therefore stand on the sidelines , in particular germany .

on wednesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed concern that the united states could launch unilateral action against iraq despite baghdad ’ s recent decision to permit inspections .
" despite the current developments , war remains the great danger .
such a war would lead to harsh and unpredictable consequences for the whole middle east , " fischer told german public broadcaster zdf .
" the great concern that remains is that there could still be unilateral measures " .
international and national criticism meanwhile , criticism in the u.s. has grown over germany ’ s go-it-alone attitude in the iraq issue .
on tuesday , the washington post accused germany of sacrificing its " international prestige and influence " in a bid to gain left-wing voters in the run-up to the elections .
" the enhanced role in international security he -lrb- schröder -rrb- has sought for his country will crumble as germany sits timidly on the sidelines , watching while its allies face up to a challenge that the chancellor cynically has ducked " , the newspaper warned .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the us -rrb- in order to gain a few seats " .
" germany has lost all influence through the chancellor ’ s remarkable isolationism " , he said .
sharp criticism also came from within germany , led by opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber .
with iraq ’ s offer to let weapons inspectors back into the country , schröder ’ s iraq policy " collapsed over night " , stoiber announced at an election campaign party rally .
former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher accused schröder of isolating germany in the daily tabloid bild .
saddam hussein ’ s decision to let inspectors back into iraq showed that international pressure was the " only language " the dictator understood .
" no one can therefore stand on the sidelines , in particular germany .
there is no room for the german way , it is german responsibility which is needed " .
ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce warned in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " it is not worth sacrificing something as precious as the german-american relationship for short-term interests " .
" the german economy relies on the good relationship to the u.s. , they are our most important market overseas and our most important partner in world trade " , he said .
in the firing line the german chancellor has come in the firing line since he defied america by opposing u.s. military action against iraq , even if it were backed by a un security council resolution .
schröder has told election crowds in various parts of the country that he refuses to " click his heels " and say yes to whatever america demands .
he has justified his position with repeated warnings of an escalation of the middle east conflict , if the u.s. attacked iraq .
in germany , voters have welcomed his approach .
polls surged for the ruling coalition by 3 per cent last week .
on wednesday , forsa showed a slim lead for schröder ’ s social democrats over stoiber ’ s opposition conservatives of 40 to 38 per cent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.09.2002 dortmund goes high brow , low brow with new concert hall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pearl of the night : the new home of dortmund 's philharmonic orchestra .
the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .
but the most important resident of the new concert hall is the dortmund philharmonic orchestra , whose musicians are already celebrating their new home – the first regular venue in the musicians ' 110 year history . carsten hinrichs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .
but which government that will be after this sunday , might well be led by the party that was able to convince germany ’ s women voters it has their best interests in mind . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the politics of raising children family issues are high on the agenda for germany ’ s politicians .

it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .
but which government that will be after this sunday , might well be led by the party that was able to convince germany ’ s women voters it has their best interests in mind . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the politics of raising children family issues are high on the agenda for germany ’ s politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.09.2002 dortmund goes high brow , low brow with new concert hall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pearl of the night : the new home of dortmund 's philharmonic orchestra .
the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .
but the most important resident of the new concert hall is the dortmund philharmonic orchestra , whose musicians are already celebrating their new home – the first regular venue in the musicians ' 110 year history . carsten hinrichs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live kultur.21 we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .

falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .

the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 18.09.2002 women 's issues a focus in german election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can she continue working after having a baby ? - a question for german politicians as election fever heats up in germany , political parties are wooing the substantial group of women voters with policies to help juggle kids and career .
it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .

on wednesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed concern that the united states could launch unilateral action against iraq despite baghdad ’ s recent decision to permit inspections .
" despite the current developments , war remains the great danger .
such a war would lead to harsh and unpredictable consequences for the whole middle east , " fischer told german public broadcaster zdf .
" the great concern that remains is that there could still be unilateral measures " .
international and national criticism meanwhile , criticism in the u.s. has grown over germany ’ s go-it-alone attitude in the iraq issue .
on tuesday , the washington post accused germany of sacrificing its " international prestige and influence " in a bid to gain left-wing voters in the run-up to the elections .
" the enhanced role in international security he -lrb- schröder -rrb- has sought for his country will crumble as germany sits timidly on the sidelines , watching while its allies face up to a challenge that the chancellor cynically has ducked " , the newspaper warned .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the us -rrb- in order to gain a few seats " .
" germany has lost all influence through the chancellor ’ s remarkable isolationism " , he said .
sharp criticism also came from within germany , led by opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber .
with iraq ’ s offer to let weapons inspectors back into the country , schröder ’ s iraq policy " collapsed over night " , stoiber announced at an election campaign party rally .
former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher accused schröder of isolating germany in the daily tabloid bild .
saddam hussein ’ s decision to let inspectors back into iraq showed that international pressure was the " only language " the dictator understood .
" no one can therefore stand on the sidelines , in particular germany .
there is no room for the german way , it is german responsibility which is needed " .
ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce warned in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " it is not worth sacrificing something as precious as the german-american relationship for short-term interests " .
" the german economy relies on the good relationship to the u.s. , they are our most important market overseas and our most important partner in world trade " , he said .
in the firing line the german chancellor has come in the firing line since he defied america by opposing u.s. military action against iraq , even if it were backed by a un security council resolution .
schröder has told election crowds in various parts of the country that he refuses to " click his heels " and say yes to whatever america demands .
he has justified his position with repeated warnings of an escalation of the middle east conflict , if the u.s. attacked iraq .
in germany , voters have welcomed his approach .
polls surged for the ruling coalition by 3 per cent last week .
on wednesday , forsa showed a slim lead for schröder ’ s social democrats over stoiber ’ s opposition conservatives of 40 to 38 per cent .
schröder has used his tough stance in the iraq issue and his skilful handling of the devastating august floods in eastern germany to deflect attention from germany ’ s weak economy .
on tuesday , schröder was quick to claim iraq ’ s offer as vindication of germany ’ s insistence on diplomatic pressure through the united nations .

on wednesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed concern that the united states could launch unilateral action against iraq despite baghdad ’ s recent decision to permit inspections .

ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce warned in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " it is not worth sacrificing something as precious as the german-american relationship for short-term interests " .

on wednesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed concern that the united states could launch unilateral action against iraq despite baghdad ’ s recent decision to permit inspections .
" despite the current developments , war remains the great danger .
such a war would lead to harsh and unpredictable consequences for the whole middle east , " fischer told german public broadcaster zdf .

on tuesday , the washington post accused germany of sacrificing its " international prestige and influence " in a bid to gain left-wing voters in the run-up to the elections .

polls surged for the ruling coalition by 3 per cent last week .
on wednesday , forsa showed a slim lead for schröder ’ s social democrats over stoiber ’ s opposition conservatives of 40 to 38 per cent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.09.2002 dortmund goes high brow , low brow with new concert hall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pearl of the night : the new home of dortmund 's philharmonic orchestra .
the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .
but the most important resident of the new concert hall is the dortmund philharmonic orchestra , whose musicians are already celebrating their new home – the first regular venue in the musicians ' 110 year history . carsten hinrichs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .
but which government that will be after this sunday , might well be led by the party that was able to convince germany ’ s women voters it has their best interests in mind . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the politics of raising children family issues are high on the agenda for germany ’ s politicians .

maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .
but which government that will be after this sunday , might well be led by the party that was able to convince germany ’ s women voters it has their best interests in mind . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the politics of raising children family issues are high on the agenda for germany ’ s politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 18.09.2002 women 's issues a focus in german election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can she continue working after having a baby ? - a question for german politicians as election fever heats up in germany , political parties are wooing the substantial group of women voters with policies to help juggle kids and career .
it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .
but which government that will be after this sunday , might well be led by the party that was able to convince germany ’ s women voters it has their best interests in mind . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the politics of raising children family issues are high on the agenda for germany ’ s politicians .

it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .
but which government that will be after this sunday , might well be led by the party that was able to convince germany ’ s women voters it has their best interests in mind . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the politics of raising children family issues are high on the agenda for germany ’ s politicians .
with the national election in mind , chancellor candidates schröder and stoiber are rushing to prove how family friendly their party platform is -lrb- april 2 , 2002 -rrb- .

the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .

with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .
but the most important resident of the new concert hall is the dortmund philharmonic orchestra , whose musicians are already celebrating their new home – the first regular venue in the musicians ' 110 year history . carsten hinrichs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .
but which government that will be after this sunday , might well be led by the party that was able to convince germany ’ s women voters it has their best interests in mind . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the politics of raising children family issues are high on the agenda for germany ’ s politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.09.2002 dortmund goes high brow , low brow with new concert hall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pearl of the night : the new home of dortmund 's philharmonic orchestra .
the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .
but the most important resident of the new concert hall is the dortmund philharmonic orchestra , whose musicians are already celebrating their new home – the first regular venue in the musicians ' 110 year history . carsten hinrichs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .

we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .
but which government that will be after this sunday , might well be led by the party that was able to convince germany ’ s women voters it has their best interests in mind . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the politics of raising children family issues are high on the agenda for germany ’ s politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 18.09.2002 women 's issues a focus in german election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can she continue working after having a baby ? - a question for german politicians as election fever heats up in germany , political parties are wooing the substantial group of women voters with policies to help juggle kids and career .
it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .

you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .

conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.09.2002 dortmund goes high brow , low brow with new concert hall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pearl of the night : the new home of dortmund 's philharmonic orchestra .
the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .
but the most important resident of the new concert hall is the dortmund philharmonic orchestra , whose musicians are already celebrating their new home – the first regular venue in the musicians ' 110 year history . carsten hinrichs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it ’ s an important issue with wide-reaching consequences . germany may be the world ’ s third largest economy and german women may enjoy a high level of equality compared to other countries .
but when it comes to juggling a career and motherhood , all that progressiveness seems to fly out of the window .
although the country offers generous tax breaks for couples with children , a lengthy maternity leave , and a monthly per child bonus pay , the government benefits actually do more harm than good by encouraging many women to stay at home and raise children rather than return to work .
when paired with the extreme shortage of child-care centres , the number of employed moms is even lower .
according to the national statistics office , there are only enough child care providers in germany to cover 7 percent of kids under three years of age .
and on the off chance that a mother gets her toddler into day care , she usually has to be home at noon , when the centre closes .
primary schools are no better , most send pupils home at one o ’ clock at the latest .
a school lunch isn ’ t even provided , since in many a german mind , a good mother has it waiting on the table at home .
to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .

to make matters worse , conservative attitudes towards women 's roles still reign in germany .
as heiner ganßmann , a sociologist at the free university in berlin says , " this is basically a conservative society in terms of values and attitudes so the image in the conservative mind is still that a woman belongs at home " .
political parties sense an opportunity it ’ s a situation that has gained considerable attention in this year ’ s election campaign as political parties across the spectrum flaunt their " family-friendly " credentials with an eye on upcoming polls .
but another good reason for german politicians to lend an ear to women ’ s issues is the fact that registered women voters outnumber male ones by a whopping two and a half million , and almost 30 percent of them are said to be undecided about their choice of chancellor .
little wonder then that both the ruling coalition of social democrats and greens as well as the opposition christian democrat / christian social union have been insisting they have the best plan to help women balance kids and career .
renate augstein -lrb- spd -rrb- , head of the equality department in germany ’ s ministry for families , seniors , women and youth welcomes the focus on women ’ s issues in this year ’ s campaign .
" it ’ s important to get this subject in the middle of politics .
in the past it was always something on the sidelines , interesting for a few women , but that was about it .
that ’ s changed now .
people realise there is a real danger there " , she told dw-radio .
so what exactly are parties proposing to lighten the woes of working mothers ?
spd in favour of all-day schools the ruling coalition quotes a study that says 70 percent of mothers in germany with children under 16 years of age want to work .
that ’ s why it ’ s putting emphasis on so-called " all-day " schools , ones which would keep kids the entire working day , instead of releasing them at noon or one o ’ clock .
the government says if re-elected , it will provide a billion euro over four years to set up 10,000 all-day schools by 2007 .
that would allow women to focus on career as well as family .
it also wants to increase the child-care support that parents receive from the state to 200 euro per child per month .
renate augstein says the plan is about stepping in to give working families a hand when they need it .
" it ’ s not just about money , it ’ s about the working world that needs to be restructured .
you know , many families go on welfare because one parent has to stop working because of the children and then the one remaining income just isn ’ t enough .
if we put more money into child care or all-day schools , then more parents could stay at their jobs and wouldn ’ t have to enter the welfare system or fall under the poverty level . "
conservatives want " more money for the family " not to be outdone , the conservative opposition parties are promising to exchange the current child-support programme with a new plan to provide what they call , " money for the family " .
the plan envisages instituting a per-child payment of 600 euro until the child reaches the age of three regardless of family income .
the monthly amount would decrease as the child grows older .
maria böhmer , head of the frauen-union , the women ’ s section of the christian democrats says the proposal is about creating justice for families and freedom of choice .
" we offer this money not based on the employment situation of the mother ; we ’ d pay this whether a mother is employed or not .
the money can help families balance children and career better .
we help people decide themselves how they want to design their lives " .
but to the social democrats , that kind of money would encourage women to design a life that means staying at home and returning to their traditional roles .
renate augstein argues that plan will do nothing to guide women back into the work force after having kids .
" the schism between men and women will become bigger ...
the man will likely be the one who is employed full time , that has to invest time , power , energy in the career and the woman probably will stay at home .
what was all that education for that we are providing our women ? ...
that plan is a dead end " , augstein said .
non-working women hurting the economy but it ’ s not just the election that political parties in germany need to worry about as they spout women-friendly policies .
the present system whereby the government offers huge tax breaks of up to about 10,000 euro for a couple with kids , where only one partner is the breadwinner and where stay-at-home moms get generous state benefits up to 460 euro for three kids not only discourages women from working , but also hurts the economy .
rainer schmidt-ruttlof a specialist on human resources at the german employers association says that germany needs its college-educated mothers to enter the workforce and fill the growing shortages in the labour market .
" today we have the best qualified generation of women we ever had in germany and we have to use these qualifications , these skills for our economy and for our business " , he said .
falling birth rates and fading potential bettina schleicher of the society of business and professional women agrees .
she says the country has to invest more in child care and after-school programmes .
if it doesn ’ t , she says , the country will be hit on three fronts .
women will be unsatisfied , the birth rate will likely continue to fall , and the investment that the country makes in educating women at its free universities is money down the drain .
" in germany , we put a lot of money into education and training , we pay high taxes for that .
but this invested money is of no use to us if the skills we ’ re imparting to these women don ’ t benefit the overall economy later on .
and i doubt that all that money for education is worth it if it only serves raising children … we ’ re throwing away potential " a further worrying problem in germany is that the mom-career dilemma has caused birth rates in germany to nosedive to under 1.4 – one of the lowest rates in western europe .
demographers fear that if the current trend continues , the results could be catastrophic .
a lack of young working people in germany ’ s rapidly ageing society could mean that the country won ’ t be able to meet its welfare costs in a couple of decades .
" women decide not to have children because they have realised that children may have a negative impact on their career , so our birth rate in germany is for example , significantly below the birth rate of the united states … the consequences of that is that the population in germany will decrease , that will increase the skills shortage " , said rainer schmidt-ruttlof .
the government must now figure out a way for its women to be productive members of the work force as well as proud parents , and get over the old thinking that brief cases and baby carriages are best left separate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.09.2002 dortmund goes high brow , low brow with new concert hall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pearl of the night : the new home of dortmund 's philharmonic orchestra .
the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .
but the most important resident of the new concert hall is the dortmund philharmonic orchestra , whose musicians are already celebrating their new home – the first regular venue in the musicians ' 110 year history . carsten hinrichs send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

the directors of dortmund 's dazzling new 48 million euro concert hall are seeking to create a cultural program that will appeal to broad swaths of the community . with great fanfare , the city of dortmund celebrated the opening of its new civic concert house this week with a series of inaugural events .
with its 48 million euro -lrb- $ 46.5 million -rrb- new facility , financed mostly by the community , dortmund is seeking to create a broad artistic program that attracts more than just the cultural elite .
thus , it was no coincidence that the first concert conducted in the new hall last friday included a performance of american composer aaron copland 's " fanfare for the common man . "
with that music selection , the hall 's artistic director hoped to demonstrate that the hall was built by the public for the public .
construction of the new facility lasted two years and generated considerable controversy .
in times of strained communal budgets in germany , the move by the social democratic and christian democratic parties on the city council to finance the project led to heated debate and a divisive discussion in the community .
but that all became a chapter of history over the weekend as the spectacular new building opened its doors to the art-loving public .
a gift from the public signs of the community 's charity and fundraising efforts are apparent throughout the building .
in addition to the many benefit concerts and fundraisers that were held , local cultural foundations also donated equipment and materials , including a mighty 53-register concert organ that was a gift of the dortmund cultural foundation .
but what really sings at the new dortmund concert hall is the building itself , designed by the dortmund-base architecture trio schröder / schulte-ladbeck / strothmann .
during the daytime , the building ’ s facade is a bit staid , but at night it blooms with a rainbow of neon lights imbedded in its glass exterior .
the concert hall is also notably lacking in extravagant details - – it can even be austere , depending on the lighting .
but the spare design places the hall fully in the service of the music that is meant to be heard here .
an acoustic force to be reckoned with few other contemporary concert halls are as acoustically well defined as dortmund ’ s , which was modeled after the magnificent musikverein concert hall in vienna .
architects made exact measurements and conducted frequent tests to ensure that it met the ideal acoustical standards , making refinements to the building right up till the end .
now , as many as 1,550 visitors can enjoy concerts of the highest possible acoustical quality .
for its first season , the concert hall 's directors have attracted wide range of stars – names that are meant to appeal to different cultural tastes and , thus , make the hall attractive to the broadest possible public .
" we also want to follow this plan in the future , " said tilman schlömp , dortmund 's artistic director .
" we 're always trying to build a bridge between serious and lighter music . "
manifestations of that philosophy are easy to find in the dortmund concert hall 's program this season , which includes everything from wagner 's " ring " to world music to a performance by the vienna philharmonic orchestra to children 's concerts to shows featuring the actress hanna schygulla and pop star reinhard mey .

on wednesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed concern that the united states could launch unilateral action against iraq despite baghdad ’ s recent decision to permit inspections .
" despite the current developments , war remains the great danger .
such a war would lead to harsh and unpredictable consequences for the whole middle east , " fischer told german public broadcaster zdf .
" the great concern that remains is that there could still be unilateral measures " .
international and national criticism meanwhile , criticism in the u.s. has grown over germany ’ s go-it-alone attitude in the iraq issue .
on tuesday , the washington post accused germany of sacrificing its " international prestige and influence " in a bid to gain left-wing voters in the run-up to the elections .
" the enhanced role in international security he -lrb- schröder -rrb- has sought for his country will crumble as germany sits timidly on the sidelines , watching while its allies face up to a challenge that the chancellor cynically has ducked " , the newspaper warned .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the us -rrb- in order to gain a few seats " .
" germany has lost all influence through the chancellor ’ s remarkable isolationism " , he said .
sharp criticism also came from within germany , led by opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber .
with iraq ’ s offer to let weapons inspectors back into the country , schröder ’ s iraq policy " collapsed over night " , stoiber announced at an election campaign party rally .
former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher accused schröder of isolating germany in the daily tabloid bild .

ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce warned in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " it is not worth sacrificing something as precious as the german-american relationship for short-term interests " .
" the german economy relies on the good relationship to the u.s. , they are our most important market overseas and our most important partner in world trade " , he said .
in the firing line the german chancellor has come in the firing line since he defied america by opposing u.s. military action against iraq , even if it were backed by a un security council resolution .
schröder has told election crowds in various parts of the country that he refuses to " click his heels " and say yes to whatever america demands .
he has justified his position with repeated warnings of an escalation of the middle east conflict , if the u.s. attacked iraq .
in germany , voters have welcomed his approach .
polls surged for the ruling coalition by 3 per cent last week .
on wednesday , forsa showed a slim lead for schröder ’ s social democrats over stoiber ’ s opposition conservatives of 40 to 38 per cent .
schröder has used his tough stance in the iraq issue and his skilful handling of the devastating august floods in eastern germany to deflect attention from germany ’ s weak economy .

on wednesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer expressed concern that the united states could launch unilateral action against iraq despite baghdad ’ s recent decision to permit inspections .
" despite the current developments , war remains the great danger .
such a war would lead to harsh and unpredictable consequences for the whole middle east , " fischer told german public broadcaster zdf .
" the great concern that remains is that there could still be unilateral measures " .
international and national criticism meanwhile , criticism in the u.s. has grown over germany ’ s go-it-alone attitude in the iraq issue .
on tuesday , the washington post accused germany of sacrificing its " international prestige and influence " in a bid to gain left-wing voters in the run-up to the elections .
" the enhanced role in international security he -lrb- schröder -rrb- has sought for his country will crumble as germany sits timidly on the sidelines , watching while its allies face up to a challenge that the chancellor cynically has ducked " , the newspaper warned .
on wednesday , u.s. government advisor richard perle told the financial times deutschland " for us , it looks as if the chancellor is distancing himself from an old friend -lrb- the us -rrb- in order to gain a few seats " .
" germany has lost all influence through the chancellor ’ s remarkable isolationism " , he said .
sharp criticism also came from within germany , led by opposition chancellor candidate edmund stoiber .
with iraq ’ s offer to let weapons inspectors back into the country , schröder ’ s iraq policy " collapsed over night " , stoiber announced at an election campaign party rally .
former foreign minister hans-dietrich genscher accused schröder of isolating germany in the daily tabloid bild .
saddam hussein ’ s decision to let inspectors back into iraq showed that international pressure was the " only language " the dictator understood .
" no one can therefore stand on the sidelines , in particular germany .
there is no room for the german way , it is german responsibility which is needed " .
ludwig georg braun , president of the german chamber of commerce warned in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " it is not worth sacrificing something as precious as the german-american relationship for short-term interests " .
" the german economy relies on the good relationship to the u.s. , they are our most important market overseas and our most important partner in world trade " , he said .
in the firing line the german chancellor has come in the firing line since he defied america by opposing u.s. military action against iraq , even if it were backed by a un security council resolution .
schröder has told election crowds in various parts of the country that he refuses to " click his heels " and say yes to whatever america demands .
he has justified his position with repeated warnings of an escalation of the middle east conflict , if the u.s. attacked iraq .
in germany , voters have welcomed his approach .
polls surged for the ruling coalition by 3 per cent last week .
on wednesday , forsa showed a slim lead for schröder ’ s social democrats over stoiber ’ s opposition conservatives of 40 to 38 per cent .
schröder has used his tough stance in the iraq issue and his skilful handling of the devastating august floods in eastern germany to deflect attention from germany ’ s weak economy .
on tuesday , schröder was quick to claim iraq ’ s offer as vindication of germany ’ s insistence on diplomatic pressure through the united nations .
in addition , schröder has offered the un the help of german weapons experts to participate in the inspections send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to iraqi move on weapons inspections iraq 's offer to allow weapons inspectors back into the country threw the un security council into disarray on tuesday .
germany welcomed the offer , expressing hopes for a possible political solution to the issue -lrb- sept .

few film directors have made such an impressive debut as sam mendes .
his first work , " american beauty " , has been described as the ultimate tale of mid-life crisis - all the more surprising that it was made by a relatively young englishman .
audiences have had to wait two years for his follow up film - but " the road to perdition " is now being released in britain .
us critics are already talking of more oscars - but here , there are signs of a somewhat different reception .
oscar-winning director sam mendes has teamed up with tom hanks for his latest movie : " the road to perdition . "
hanks , twice an oscar winner himself , plays a hardman nicknamed the angel of death , who is seeking revenge for the murder of his wife and two sons .
the film is based on a dc comic strip .
it is set in 1930s chicago , when america 's mobsters were at their height .
midas mendes by the bbc 's bob chaundy sam mendes ' quest for glamour and success started early .
when he was cricket captain at magdalen college school , oxford , during a tour of barbados , he wrote in the tour programme his interests included " fishnet tights " and that his ambition was to be " remembered by many " .
he achieved both schoolboy musings in one go several years later .
actress nicole kidman appeared - scantily clad - in the blue room , when the star made her stage debut .
the production made national headlines , with one newspaper describing the performance as " theatrical viagra " .
now , with eight oscar nominations for his film debut , american beauty , it seems sam mendes is in no danger of being forgotten .
his dedication to drama took root at cambridge university .
schoolfriend tom piper , involved in set design at the same time , recalls mendes was " seduced by the fun and excitement " of theatre .
" despite the absence of any drama course , there were 130 student productions in a year run by people studying english and history or whatever .
so everyone was an expert , " he says .
mendes , 35 , achieved a first in english , but also managed to develop the entrepreneurial skills needed to make it as a director .
he took on several projects , including forming new theatre companies , one of which went to the edinburgh festival and included comedian and scriptwriter david baddiel .
' brilliant boy ' but the big break came in 1987 , when he stepped in to replace an absent director at a play in chichester .
he forged success with it in the west end , which then led to work with the prestigious royal shakespeare company .
highly acclaimed productions followed , including troilus and cressida with ralph fiennes , and richard iii with simon russell-beale .
russell-beale puts a large element of mendes ' success down to man-management .
" he understands the needs of the people he works with , " he says .
" a good director needs to instil in his actors that they 're good actors .
sam makes me feel he loves my work even if at times he can be quite savage " .
his work in london continued with such successes as the rise and fall of little voice with jane horrocks , with whom he shared a long-term relationship .
the play went on to be a film hit , with horrocks taking the lead role .
dame judi dench , who described mendes as a " brilliant boy " , worked with him in the sea and the cherry orchard .
audience empathy by 1992 , sam mendes was well-established , and became artistic director of the donmar warehouse , then a struggling west end fringe venue .
he revamped its reputation with productions of stage classics such as the glass menagerie , company , cabaret and habeas corpus .
" sam has pitched his market perfectly at the donmar " , said tom piper .
" he has managed to create an appetite for interesting plays but ones that people already know . "
simon russell-beale agrees .
" he has an eye for what an audience will accept , " he said .
" he pitches it right .
american beauty pitched right into the american psyche . "
the hollywood adventure came about after steven spielberg had seen mendes ' production of oliver on the london stage while filming the oscar-winning saving private ryan .
" i banked his name in my mind , " spielberg said .
in the spring of 1998 , spielberg took in another of mendes 's musical hits , cabaret , in new york and was impressed not least by his visual sense .
within days , he had offered him the script of american beauty , and , within a few more days , mendes had agreed to direct it .
another big hollywood name , kevin spacey had been playing in the ice man cometh at the similarly small almeida theatre .
the timing was perfect and spacey agreed to star in the film .
mendes ' bitter-sweet treatment of dysfunctional family life , midlife crises , and teenage alienation in suburban america was the result .

the play went on to be a film hit , with horrocks taking the lead role .
dame judi dench , who described mendes as a " brilliant boy " , worked with him in the sea and the cherry orchard .
audience empathy by 1992 , sam mendes was well-established , and became artistic director of the donmar warehouse , then a struggling west end fringe venue .
he revamped its reputation with productions of stage classics such as the glass menagerie , company , cabaret and habeas corpus .
" sam has pitched his market perfectly at the donmar " , said tom piper .
" he has managed to create an appetite for interesting plays but ones that people already know . "
simon russell-beale agrees .
" he has an eye for what an audience will accept , " he said .
" he pitches it right .
american beauty pitched right into the american psyche . "
the hollywood adventure came about after steven spielberg had seen mendes ' production of oliver on the london stage while filming the oscar-winning saving private ryan .
" i banked his name in my mind , " spielberg said .
in the spring of 1998 , spielberg took in another of mendes 's musical hits , cabaret , in new york and was impressed not least by his visual sense .
within days , he had offered him the script of american beauty , and , within a few more days , mendes had agreed to direct it .
another big hollywood name , kevin spacey had been playing in the ice man cometh at the similarly small almeida theatre .
the timing was perfect and spacey agreed to star in the film .
mendes ' bitter-sweet treatment of dysfunctional family life , midlife crises , and teenage alienation in suburban america was the result .

the poll also suggests that three quarters of the catholic population support the recent police reforms , but less than half of protestants do so .
the poll , carried out in the last week , asked more than 500 northern ireland people for their opinions on crime and policing in the province .
among other key indications from the poll by icm , are that 63 % of those polled believe crime has gone up over the past five years , 39 % think cctv would make them feel safer on the streets and 75 % have no confidence in the police catching criminals involved in car theft or burglary .
fears over children 's safety are reflected in answers to the question : " if your child were to go for a walk in your area on their own after dark , how worried would you be that you might become the victim of a street crime ? "
eighty-five percent of respondents said they would be worried , rising to 87 % among mothers .
in a section on support for northern ireland policing reforms in the past two years , 55 % of all respondents gave their support , with 75 % of catholics and 43 % of protestants giving their backing .
thirty-nine per cent of protestants opposed the package , with just 12 % of catholics questioned declaring opposition .
the poll findings indicate a lack of confidence in the police service of northern ireland 's ability to tackle crime and points raised from it will be among those put to new chief constable hugh orde when he takes questions in a special bbc one northern ireland programme on wednesday night .
mr orde will reply to issues raised by members of an invited audience made up of victims of crimes , ranging from car theft to muggings .

the landmark flintshire conference organised by north wales drug and alcohol forum has re-ignited the debate on drug use and the policing of drugs in the uk .
north wales police chief constable richard brunstrom has called for a joined-up approach to stopping wales ' 10,000 drug addicts committing crimes and spending £ 2m weekly on their habit .
mr brunstrom recently argued that the war on drugs should fundamentally change .
" drugs are ever more freely available and the uk 's position is the worst in europe , " he said .
" the crime , health and societal consequences of the war on drugs are demonstrably awful .
" not only this , -lsb- but -rsb- our current policy is demonstrably making things worse , " said mr brunstrom .
but a bbc / icm poll to coincide with the bbc 's cracking crime day found public opinion split on the effect of reforms .
76 % of 500 survey respondents believe children are carrying out the attacks to pay for drugs but 50 % think prescribing heroin to users will increase crime ; 40 % disagree 32 % think relaxation of cannabis laws will cause more crime while 20 % expect a reduction arrested addicts the outspoken chief constable has previously said people were deluding themselves if they thought that arresting drug offenders and throwing away the key were solutions to the knock-on impact of drug-related crime .
officers in the north wales force are trying to rectify the situation and have six community psychiatric nurses working for them .
they are based at cell blocks so an immediate assessment and possible treatment can be carried out on addicts arrested for crimes .
in august , south wales ' three police forces declared combined intentions - under operation tarian - to arm arm officers in the fight against drugs .
they warned of a flood of cheap heroin and cocaine from bristol and birmingham and , with it , the crime and gun culture that is plaguing parts of those cities .
last week , north wales police launched a compulsory drug testing pilot project in north east wales .
people being held in custody in wrexham and flintshire are being tested for heroin and cocaine misuse after police were given special powers by the home office .
the scheme was introduced after research showed they were most commonly associated with drug-related crime .
key conference speakers from across europe are taking part in wednesday 's forum .
they include the welsh assembly government 's chief drugs policy adviser dr richard pates and netherlands government drugs adviser dr bob keizer .
they will present their views on current and future policy and legislation in the uk .
the key issues being discussed include whether there should be a review of the current legal system and if a controlled prescription of heroin should be trialled to a group of drug users .
in december last year , the police chief told north wales police authority the royal commission should investigate the possibility of legalising some drugs .
he has previously compared the uk 's drug policy to that of america 's alcohol prohibition in the 1920s .

the landmark flintshire conference organised by north wales drug and alcohol forum has re-ignited the debate on drug use and the policing of drugs in the uk .
north wales police chief constable richard brunstrom has called for a joined-up approach to stopping wales ' 10,000 drug addicts committing crimes and spending £ 2m weekly on their habit .
drug addiction can lead to crime mr brunstrom recently argued that the war on drugs should fundamentally change .
" drugs are ever more freely available and the uk 's position is the worst in europe , " he said .
" the crime , health and societal consequences of the war on drugs are demonstrably awful .
" not only this , -lsb- but -rsb- our current policy is demonstrably making things worse , " said mr brunstrom .
but a bbc / icm poll to coincide with the bbc 's cracking crime day found public opinion split on the effect of reforms .
76 % of 500 survey respondents believe children are carrying out the attacks to pay for drugs but 50 % think prescribing heroin to users will increase crime ; 40 % disagree 32 % think relaxation of cannabis laws will cause more crime while 20 % expect a reduction arrested addicts the outspoken chief constable has previously said people were deluding themselves if they thought that arresting drug offenders and throwing away the key were solutions to the knock-on impact of drug-related crime .
officers in the north wales force are trying to rectify the situation and have six community psychiatric nurses working for them .
richard brunstrom will attend the meeting they are based at cell blocks so an immediate assessment and possible treatment can be carried out on addicts arrested for crimes .
in august , south wales ' three police forces declared combined intentions - under operation tarian - to arm arm officers in the fight against drugs .
they warned of a flood of cheap heroin and cocaine from bristol and birmingham and , with it , the crime and gun culture that is plaguing parts of those cities .
last week , north wales police launched a compulsory drug testing pilot project in north east wales .
people being held in custody in wrexham and flintshire are being tested for heroin and cocaine misuse after police were given special powers by the home office .
the scheme was introduced after research showed they were most commonly associated with drug-related crime .
key conference speakers from across europe are taking part in wednesday 's forum .
they include the welsh assembly government 's chief drugs policy adviser dr richard pates and netherlands government drugs adviser dr bob keizer .
they will present their views on current and future policy and legislation in the uk .
the key issues being discussed include whether there should be a review of the current legal system and if a controlled prescription of heroin should be trialled to a group of drug users .
in december last year , the police chief told north wales police authority the royal commission should investigate the possibility of legalising some drugs .
he has previously compared the uk 's drug policy to that of america 's alcohol prohibition in the 1920s .

the continent 's most creative cartoon makers are gathered for three days from wednesday to show off pilots and pitch new series to 250 investors looking for co-production partners .
the meeting on the faenol estate is organised by the european union media development programme cartoon forum , which visits a different country each september .
eighty brand new animation projects are vying for slices of some 290m euros swishing around - money which could get six new welsh ideas , and a record 31 uk pitches , onto screens around the world .
the event 's choice of wales as a meeting point is testament to the growing admiration the country acquired in animation over the last 20 years - mainly the result of broadcaster s4c helping finance homegrown talent .
demand for hotel rooms in llandudno has outstripped supply with creatives and commissioners from 15 countries rubbing shoulders with crew members for the forthcoming tomb raider 2 movie , which begins filming in snowdonia on wednesday .
" in wales , you can not fail to be inspired , " said cartoon forum officer alexandra tholance .
" legends abound .
it is an astonishing place of fairly cartoon-like spirit . "
the forum is neither a festival nor a fair , but a space for animators and tv bosses to meet and agree finance for co-production - sharing the burden and selling their work across europe in several languages .
previous forums have seen 250 cartoons win 630m euros in funding with ideas making the transition from drawing board or five-minute pilot to final full series production .
by friday , several deals should have been concluded and hundreds of new comic characters will leave wales a step closer to enjoying idol status in thousands of youngsters ' eyes .
animating wales in wales , the animation industry is worth between £ 5m to £ 10m and employs at least 200 people , according to superted creator and welsh animation group chair robin lyons .
the independent sector has burgeoned since the creation of s4c 20 years ago , when it commissioned superted from siriol productions of cardiff . "
having the event on our doorstep gives welsh independent producers an excellent opportunity to target broadcasters from all over europe " huw walters , s4c international " despite a downturn in animation generally , things are holding up well in wales , " mr lyons told bbc news online .
" we have the talent here , but somehow have not yet managed to create a real industry .
we 're working on it .
" s4c do a lot to support animation , and we are attracting contracts from outside wales .
" cartoon forum gives us all an opportunity to show what wales is about , and to showcase some of the projects being developed here . "

it 's not just about tea , it 's about a national symbol and it 's about market access for our products astrid ludin , south african trade department their existence is betrayed by the cave paintings they left behind and a strange process of crushing , fermenting and drying one of the unique fynbos , or fine bush plants that fill the mountains - and making them into a tea .
for hundreds of years they used the healthy properties of the rooibos plant to make a brew that is now south africa 's national natural drink and is becoming increasingly popular around the world .
farmer joubert roux says sales to the uk have almost doubled in the last year , germany is the biggest consumer , and of course america is the biggest potential market for a product with no caffeine and a long list of healthy characteristics .
name game but the name rooibos has been trademarked in the us and producers looking to expand their market find themselves blocked .
george grub is standing firm now , they are prepared to launch court action and have now got their government on board .
" under the current rules they could stop us at port of entry or they could even go as far as to remove our product from the shelves if it is marketed under the name rooibos , " says george grub , the chairman of rooibos limited , which is fighting the trademark .
" the name rooibos is a generic name like you have whisky or other products elsewhere .
the person who registered the trademark knew it was an indigenous name and we will not change the name as that 's what it is known as internationally . "
not without a fight but the owner of the trademark is not willing to let the name go either : " the name rooibos was totally unknown in the us in 1992 .
no-one was aware of rooibos tea or the benefits that went with it , " says virginia burke-watkins , who is based in dallas .
this is a world problem and therefore the issue of rooibos is just an incident within the bigger picture macdonald netshitenzhe , lawyer " it took us many years to develop that market - trademarks may not mean a lot to south africa , but it means everything in the us .
if i did n't hold the trademark in the us someone else would . "
us trademark law normally bans ownership of names which describe generic products , such as coffee or tea .
but according to ms burke watkins , her trademark is legitimate because at the time when she registered it , the word " rooibos " was practically unknown in the us .
any popularity it now has , she insists , is largely down to her efforts to advertise it as a health food product .
government gets involved it is one of a growing number of cases of indigenous names versus trademarks and it has given the south african government an indication of just how much international trade they could be losing every year .
not just tea - a national symbol they have backed the action by the tea producers and are now cataloguing all their indigenous products to compare them against international databases to check if they have been trademarked .
" it 's not just about tea , it 's about a national symbol and it 's about market access for our products , " said astrid ludin , in the south african department of trade and industry 's consumer and corporate regulation division .
" the rooibos issue has brought to the fore a host of problems and required a pro-active response from us .
this is an indigenous name and rooibos is an important export product . "
rights wronged and indigenous rights is not just an issue peculiar to south africa .
" this is a world problem and therefore the issue of rooibos is just an incident within the bigger picture , " says macdonald netshitenzhe , specialist lawyer with the south african dti .
" the amazon basin has its own specific problems , as does europe and the rest of africa - this is a multilateral arrangement and goes beyond one nation . "
there is a lot more at stake in the long term , as south africa has dozens of indigenous plants important in a variety of ways - all of them commercially .
not only is the new research important for medicine , but as the south african government well knows it could be worth a lot of money to a country catching up on international trade after years of sanctions and isolation .

speaking at a stop the war coalition rally in east london , veteran left-wing journalist paul foot told activists they genuinely had the power to stop a conflict .
those madmen that are in charge can be stopped paul foot he said public opinion was with the anti-war movement and the " utter madmen " in george bush 's administration had already bowed to pressure by going to the united nations .
the onus was now on those against war to " move forward " , he said .
" those madmen that are in charge can be stopped , " he added .
