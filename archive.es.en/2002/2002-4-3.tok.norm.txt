people may have unrealistic expectations about returns on their investments because of such advertising , the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- said .
the fsa wants the balance to be redressed between the emphasis given to product benefits and drawbacks .
it aims set up a hotline for people to report on misleading advertisements by the summer .

realistic appraisal the regulator is consulting on proposals to strengthen the current rules on the way firms use past performance figures in adverts .
it proposes these figures should be presented in a way that links it with the future performance of a product .
the watchdog added that warnings about past performance should be included in the main text of the advert , not buried in the small print .
adverts for bond funds should include information on both annual income and long-term income , including losses and gains to the capital invested .
" our proposals on past performance are designed to ensure that such figures are not viewed in isolation but considered alongside other important factors , such as flexibility , charges and investment strategy , " said the fsa 's consumer director christine farnish .

britain sent a task force to re-capture the islands , and the two countries found themselves at war .
celia susterman is from argentina but lives in britain .
in the third of our falklands series , she tells breakfast what it was like to be living here at the time of the conflict , exactly twenty years ago .
celia susterman : a view of the falklands " when i heard about the sinking of the belgrano that was the worst moment of the whole conflict and when i heard how many argentines had died at the time i was totally distressed .
" and also because at the time they said the first news was as we know that the belgrano had been sailing away from the islands .
so i was shocked at the time because i thought how come they 're changing the rules of engagement without any warning .
british newspaper coverage was very patriotic " this is not fair play this is not what i have always thought and believed about the uk .
so again that was a very difficult moment in a way because not only the fact of all these young men dying but also in conditions , this was n't war this was unfairness as i saw it .
" i was always torn apart by images of jingoism which i thought offensive , but at the same time , equally distressed by jingoistic images coming from argentina .
" so i felt , it was a very strange time , very schizophrenic because i could n't feel that i was with either side .
" i saw the demonstrations in the main square , and i was horrified because they were so similar to the images that i had seen at the time of the world cup " at the time , i had been totally taken aback by those manifestations of joy in the middle of what i knew was the most terrible repression , people disappearing and being tortured whatever , i knew it because i had friends who had disappeared .
" my friends in argentina knew as little about the falklands - malvinas - and life on the islands as i did before arriving in this country .
" we did n't have much information at all we just had this constant insistence that the malvinas belonged to argentina that britain had taken them by force at the height of her imperial and colonial power and therefore that right was on our side .
" so then there was this huge disappointment when argentina lost the war : not just that the islands would become argentine but also the fact of winning a war - being defeated in a war that counts .

in an annual report required by congress , the us trade representative 's -lrb- ustr -rrb- office listed 55 countries , accusing many of them of building tariff barriers which cost us firms export sales .
japan and the european union are both high on the ustr 's list of offenders .
the two are also the loudest voices against the bush administration 's decision to slap tariffs on foreign steel , in an attempt to shore up votes ahead of elections in november and protect the us steel industry .
worst offenders the report devotes as much as 10 % of its 460 pages to japan , which it cited for agricultural import barriers and anti-competitive telecoms connection fees .
in particular it singled out restrictions on apple imports based on concerns over a bacterial infection , a barrier which could yet trigger a us complaint to the world trade organisation .
europe 's common agricultural policy also comes in for criticism , with the ban on genetically modified crops and hormone-treated beef chosen as examples of protectionism .
other highlights include : poultry restrictions in south africa and the ukraine - echoed recently by russia after salmonella concerns ; cd and dvd piracy in the far east and ukraine ; south korean tax rules which eat into pharmaceutical imports and car sales ; telecoms problems in mexico , where the dominant telmex has a market stranglehold ; and canada 's restrictions on wheat imports and its alleged habit of dumping timber on the us market .
the report noted some improvements in the picture for us exporters , notably in brazil where substantial liberalisation has come in recent years - although an unwieldy licensing system and customs regime came in for criticism .
but china - also vociferous in its dissatisfaction with the steel tariffs and one of the wto 's newest recruits - was criticised for non-tariff barriers on agricultural produce .
defensive the report may be an annual ritual , but the equally traditional complaints from allies and trade partners will be especially loud this year given the us steel tariffs .
speaking to reporters at the report 's launch , ustr officials said that the tariffs - of up to 30 % , for the next three years - are a legitimate effort to stop unfair trade supported by foreign government subsidies .
the report contained numerous examples of such behaviour , they said .
" by identifying barriers to trade , we can work with our trade partners globally , regionally and bilaterally to eliminate these barriers while further liberalising our market at home , " said us trade representative robert zoellick in a statement .
in response , japan is likely to point to anti-free trade regulations in the us - for example the law which means congress still has to approve the takeover by any foreign company of a us telecoms carrier .
despite complaints about the state of free trade , the us trade deficit actually fell slightly last year to $ 347.8bn from $ 375.5bn in 2000 .

a palestinian woman was reported to have been killed after being hit by a bullet .
in bethlehem , more than 100 armed palestinian police and militia are reported to have taken refuge in the church of the nativity - built on the spot where christians believe jesus was born .
they fled there after fighting running battles with israeli forces , now deployed outside the church .
the united nations agency responsible for palestinian refugees says thousands of people throughout the west bank have been trapped with dwindling supplies of food and water .
late on tuesday us president george w bush urged all those who " yearn for peace " in the middle east to work to stop " the terrorist activities " .
israeli prime minister ariel sharon spoke of the possibility of exiling yasser arafat - a proposal rejected by the palestinian leader who is trapped in ramallah .

israel accused mr rajoub of sheltering dozens of fighters in his headquarters , but the security chief said the people inside the building were officials , women employees and three children .
israel media reported that the army 's main target in the compound was the commander of fatah in the west bank , marwan barghouti , who israel accuses of involvement in recent militant attacks .
life under curfew officials at ramallah 's central hospital say they have started burying corpses of people killed during israel 's invasion in the hospital grounds because the morgue was full and travel to the cemetery was blocked .
" we have found 28 bodies of people killed by israelis so far .
we are burying them in the garden because the ambulances can not take them out , " hospital administrator mussa abu hmed told afp .
the palestinian red crescent complains of being unable to answer hundreds of calls it has received from the sick in ramallah , while a convoy carrying its regional chief was detained and abused by the army .
" the behaviour toward the medical teams and to the sick and injured has been appalling , " red crescent official husam sharkawi told the bbc .
the israeli prime minister says his army 's actions are aimed at eliminating once and for all what he calls a terrorist infrastructure .

three palestinian gunman and at least four non-combatants were said to have been killed by israeli fire in bethlehem .
ramallah surrender earlier , tanks and helicopter gunships blitzed the ramallah headquarters of palestinian preventative security chief jibril rajoub , setting buildings ablaze and causing an unknown number of casualties among the 400 people said to be inside .
sharon offered arafat a " one-way ticket " out of ramallah the people holed up inside the security compound then surrendered in a us-brokered ceasefire .
israel accused mr rajoub of sheltering dozens of fighters in his headquarters , but the security chief said the people inside the building were officials , women employees and three children .
israel media reported that the army 's main target in the compound was the commander of fatah in the west bank , marwan barghouti , who israel accuses of involvement in recent militant attacks .
life under curfew officials at ramallah 's central hospital say they have started burying corpses of people killed during israel 's invasion in the hospital grounds because the morgue was full and travel to the cemetery was blocked .
rajoub said there were no militants in his compound " we have found 28 bodies of people killed by israelis so far .
we are burying them in the garden because the ambulances can not take them out , " hospital administrator mussa abu hmed told afp .
the palestinian red crescent complains of being unable to answer hundreds of calls it has received from the sick in ramallah , while a convoy carrying its regional chief was detained and abused by the army .
" the behaviour toward the medical teams and to the sick and injured has been appalling , " red crescent official husam sharkawi told the bbc .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- fowl flu takes nuggets off the menu categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 3 april , 2002 , 07:00 gmt 08:00 uk fowl flu takes nuggets off the menu mr fujita is to step down at the end of this month japanese branches of mcdonald 's are having to pull chicken from the menu , following an outbreak of bird flu in the us .
almost all the fast food chain 's outlets in japan are withdrawing chicken mcnuggets as stocks run out .
imports of us chickens were banned by the government on 18 march following an outbreak of bird flu in virginia .
but although the ban has been lifted for all but three states , birds from virginia - the source for almost all mcdonald 's poultry in japan - remain off limits .
also at risk are two menu items unique to outlets in japan , the chicken tatsuta and the teriyaki mcburger .
the move comes at a bad time for mcdonald 's , which has seen burger sales suffer from fears over mad cow disease .
proof while fowl flu is normally not a problem for humans , japanese people are not in the mood these days to accept assurances of safety that easily .
the slow response of both business and the government in dealing with bovine spongiform encephalopathy -lrb- bse , or " mad cow disease " -rrb- has produced calls for the agriculture minister 's resignation .
a government panel criticised the administration 's handling of the outbreak , saying it ignored warnings and could have saved consumers months of worry and the food industry billions in lost sales .
it has also triggered the bankruptcy of snow brand , one of the biggest food and dairy companies in japan , after the firm admitted to relabelling beef to obtain government anti-bse subsidies .
striking twice with this experience , the fact that hong kong has slaughtered 1.4 million chickens after a virus similar to the one in virginia crossed over and killed six people is likely to be of concern to the japanese public .
and assurances from the world health organisation that only live birds can pass on the illness will cut little ice .
a mcdonald 's spokesman said it hoped to restart nugget sales in april , once it could source birds from elsewhere such as china .
" while there may be some people who wo n't come to our shops because of the lack of chicken nuggets , others may not feel that way and will buy our other products , " said mcdonald 's japan spokesman kenji kaniya .
another health scare could be a major blow to mcdonald 's .
thanks to the bse experience and the slowing economy , the chain has decided to close 130 outlets this year while opening just 220 , well below the previous pace of expansion .
turnover at mcdonald 's has sunk every month since late last year as a result of sliding burger sales .

by gary eason bbc news online at the nasuwt conference a teacher has been contrasting the bonus he received for 25 years ' service to education with the £ 75,000 footballer ryan giggs earned per week .
tim marple recalled how the manchester united and wales winger got an extra £ 1m from his testimonial match last summer .
" at the same time i got a certificate for 25 years ' teaching in wolverhampton - and a bonus of £ 150 , " he said .
" that works out at £ 6 per year or £ 2 per term .
" one of my colleagues paid five terms ' worth to go and see giggs . "
' i want my life back ' mr marple told the nasuwt teachers ' union conference in scarborough : " who is the better role model - the professional footballer or a teacher ? "
he said it had made him so angry he wrote a letter of complaint to the education secretary , estelle morris .
proposing a resolution on teacher shortages , jacqui simpson from birmingham complained of a " downward spiral of piecemeal strategies " from government aimed at tackling the problem .
jacqui simpson : " teachers want out " she recalled the sort of comments teachers made to her as they struggled with their workload : " i want my life back " , " my marriage is beginning to suffer " , " i never see my little girl " .
wastage " teachers are voting with their feet and leaving the classroom , often without jobs or a pension to go to - this is how desperate they are to get out , " she said .
figures showed that 30 % of trained teachers never entered a classroom and another 20 % left within three years .
the answer was to make teaching an attractive job again by cutting workload , tackling indisicipline , reviewing " the bureaucratic burden " and rewarding teachers well for the job they did - without their " jumping through the hoop " onto the new , performance-related pay scale .
the problems with the operation of that scheme , now in its second year , were raised by another conference delegate in a question and answer session with the visiting education minister , stephen timms .

" my head teacher now tells me the school ca n't afford to pay all the teachers that have met their performance management objectives , " she said .
" why have i been let down so badly ? " she asked , to loud applause from the conference hall .
the mood turned to derision when mr timms said that it had always been made clear that performance-related payments would be " discretionary " .
he said talks were still going on about how much money would be available to fund the system next year with the head teacher associations in england and wales - which are threatening industrial action on the issue .
the nasuwt leader , nigel de gruchy , said performance pay schemes the world over had foundered when there was not the money to support them .
any such scheme " must imply an open cheque " , he said .
" otherwise it will disappear into the obscurity and oblivion it undoubtedly deserves . "

the three-day visit by lim dong-won , a former unification minister , is the first public contact between the sides for months .
" i am going to pyongyang to prevent the building of tension on the korean peninsula and arrange a breakthrough in south-north relations , " he said before departure .
he was met at the airport by kim wan-su , a senior official from the north korean committee that handles inter-korean relations , the country 's official kcna news agency said .
mr lim said in seoul that he would hold the first round of talks with north korean officials on wednesday afternoon , to discuss the timing of his meeting with north korean leader kim jong-il .
mr lim has been a key architect of south korean president kim dae-jung 's " sunshine policy " , aimed at engaging the communist state with whom seoul is still technically at war .
north korea suspended inter-korean government exchanges last november , angered by what it believed was a hostile policy being pursued against it by the united states - a close ally of the south .
much is resting on mr lim 's visit even though the south korean government is playing down expectations .
clock ticking the stakes are high now , partly because president dae-jung , who has doggedly pursued efforts to engage the north , has less than a year left in office .
unfinished business further reunions of families separated by the korean war reopening rail and road links cut off by the north-south border joint construction of an industrial park in north korea visit by north korean leader to south closer economic ties whoever his successor turns out to be may not be so active in trying to activate exchanges with the north .
the president 's envoy will be carrying a message for the north korean leader , urging him to revive a series of projects that the two sides had agreed since their historic summit nearly two years ago .
they include a return visit to south korea by kim jong-il ; further reunions between elderly relatives separated since the korean war half a century ago ; the connection of road and rail links between the two countries ; and the implementation of a series of economic agreements .
the envoy will also want to address new concerns about north korea 's nuclear and missile programmes , and urge pyongyang to begin talks with japan and the us .
the bbc 's seoul correspondent caroline gluck says many in the south are sceptical about this trip resulting in major breakthroughs , although pyongyang , which needs economic help and food aid , may agree to more family reunions .
but north korea still remains highly unpredictable and some surprises could be in store , she says .

during the telecom heyday of 1998-2000 , he set the cable world alight with a stream of ambitious acquisitions .
knapp charmed investors with his vision for ntl now he is fighting to save his company from bankruptcy - and has been forced to sell his gulf stream jet .
he is barclay knapp , the 44-year old chief executive of cable company , ntl , which is in the middle of painstaking negotiations to restructure £ 12bn of debt .
strip away all the money that ntl owes the bank , and it is an attractive company with a promising future supplying cable tv and broadband internet to the british masses .
if only life was so simple .
the use of debt to acquire more than 12 companies during the past few years , has left ntl struggling to pay back just the interest .
it 's got the potential ...
" it is a good fundamental business model , " says helen rodriguez , head of european high-yield research at deutsche bank .
facts & figures 1993 : cabletel founded by barclay knapp & george blumenthal 1996 : adopts ntl as name 1999 : acquires cable & wireless communications 2001 : hits target for 100,000 broadband customers 2002 : appoints advisors in feb to help restructure debt " the revenue model is proven and it works .
but ntl needs to find a way of getting its costs and its balance sheet in line . "
ntl makes its money by bundling cable tv , cheap telephone services and internet access .
currently , it is the market leader in high-speed uk internet access , serving 180,000 customers .
however , progress has been hamstrung by a mish-mash of cable networks , hobbled together through a series of acquisitions .
telecom start-up ntl emerged from humble beginnings .
in 1993 , mr knapp and ntl 's current chairman george blumenthal set up a company called international cabletel , with an investment of $ 25m .
in 1996 , the company changed its name to ntl after acquiring national transcommunications limited , the network of television transmitter masts that power itv , channel 4 and channel 5 .
within seven years of setting up , the company was worth $ 12.5bn , as it rode high on the froth of the dot.com wave .
it seemed eager to challenge the dominance of satellite giant bskyb , even attempting to take over football club newcastle united , after rupert murdoch bid for manchester united .
a trail of debt at the time , running up massive debts to buy companies - rather than using its equity - seemed a good idea because it left the company 's share price largely unaffected .
but its aggressive strategy has come back to haunt it - ntl lost its main listing in new york last week after the company 's share price sank to 20 cents .
at their height , the shares peaked at $ 100 , and were still worth nearly $ 40 as recently as last year .
other achievements that have since turned sour include buying cable & wireless communications in 1999 for more than £ 8bn .
at the time , it whipped c & w from under the nose of cable rival telewest , but now the purchase seems grossly overpriced .
in its last set of company results on 27 march , ntl reported an £ 8bn write-down of exceptional charges , assets and goodwill .
the company 's strategy was again knocked off course when it was unable to sell its transmission business to slash its debt pile .
at the bargaining table with its debt level now reaching crisis-point , the company 's bondholders hold the trump cards .
they are negotiating to swap more than half of the company 's debt into equity , which would turn them from creditors into company owners .
if it can sort out the balance sheet , it will be in a good position to compete with bskyb morten andersen deutsche bank " it is very complex , " says a trader at merrill lynch .
" there are multiple classes of debt which means there many people at the bargaining table . "
any debt-for-equity swap would effectively wipe out the value of the company 's existing shares .
however , morten andersen , a new media analyst at deutsche bank , says there could be some hope for shareholders if the company pulls through .
" the debt-for-equity swap will mean they have a minute shareholding , but in the future there could be value in that . "
faded visions mr knapp has come in for some heavy criticism for his part in the saga , but for the time being has managed to hold onto its job .
he may no longer be the internet visionary , but he has been given some credit for cutting costs , including thousands of job losses in the past year .
the company is also working hard to improve customer service after being dogged with complaints .
but the company 's future also rests on new investment .
it is understood to be talking to john malone 's liberty media and aol time warner about possible injections of capital .
long-term survival ?
if you ask the analysts , most agree that ntl will survive in some form .
" will there be a cable company in the uk in five years ' time ? " asks ms rodriguez .
" absolutely .
will it be called ntl ?
i do n't know .
but a solution will be found . "
her colleague , mr andersen is also optimistic .
" if it can sort out the balance sheet , it will be in a good position to compete with bskyb . "
it is possible that the flamboyant mr knapp still harbours ambitions to knock mr murdoch off his throne .
if current negotiations go to plan , he may get a second chance - a rare thing in the turbulent world of telecom has-beens .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- q & a : bubble baby ' cure ' categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : health front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health background briefings medical notes education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics wednesday , 3 april , 2002 , 09:57 gmt 10:57 uk q & a : bubble baby ' cure ' rhys evans has been given a second chance of life by a pioneering gene therapy treatment at london 's great ormond street hospital .
bbc news online examines the significance of the successful treatment for those with diseases caused by defective genes .
what illness has been successfully treated ?
the toddler suffered from severe combined immunodeficiency -lrb- scid -rrb- - a condition which robbed him of the immune cells needed to fight infection .
as a result he had to live permanently in a sterile environment as a precaution against the transmission of bacteria and viruses which could kill him .
it is caused by a single defective gene - a tiny biological instruction , found in every cell .
what did the scientists do to help him ?
normally , the immune system is generated from cells produced in the bone marrow .
in rhys ' case , this was not happening because " master cells " in the marrow were not working properly owing to the genetic fault .
one solution is to give a bone marrow transplant , entirely replacing his marrow with a matching sample from someone else .
however , no match was found either inside or outside rhys ' family .
instead , they took some of his own marrow , and extracted the " master cells " , or stem cells , from it .
in the laboratory , they created a new , correct , version of his faulty gene .
this new genetic code was inserted into the genes of a particular type of viruses called retroviruses , which had been altered so they could not cause disease .
when the viruses and the stem cells were put together , the viruses " infected " the stem cells .
retroviruses reproduce by incorporating their own genetic code into the code of the cell they have infected , and waiting for the cell to reproduce - reproducing their genes with it .
so , the new version of the gene spliced into the retrovirus was inserted into the make-up of the stem cell .
the result was a sample of bone marrow cells with a fully-functional gene .
these cells were injected back into rhys - and started working properly , dividing into the correct immune system cells , and helping him fight disease .
has this been done before ?
yes .
a team of experts at a paris hospital has carried out the procedure on a few babies , starting in 2000 .
their results have been similarly impressive .
this is the first treatment of its kind in the uk .
why is this exciting for scientists researching other gene therapies ?
faulty genes are responsible for , or greatly contribute to , many other serious illnesses .
hundreds of scientists worldwide are trying to find ways to use the same principles to tackle them .
this treatment for scid is one of the first successful examples of gene therapy , proving that , in principle , if you can get to the cells you want to change , you may be able to treat previously intractable illnesses .
can this advance be applied to other illnesses ?
the great ormond street team is hoping to apply it to other conditions similar to scid - faulty genes within bone marrow cells that affect the development of the immune system .
elsewhere , the potential of targeted gene therapy - both to correct single gene disorders , and to attack unwanted cells , such as cancer cells , is said to be immense .
however , other studies have illustrated the difficulties faced by doctors trying to develop gene therapy .
in this case , doctors were able to remove exactly the cells they wanted to change , and then alter them in a laboratory test tube before putting them back .
other teams face the challenge of getting their viruses to cells in organs deep within the body , or to cells spread throughout the body .
this means finding a carrier virus which is effective at targeting the right cells in a living , breathing , human , and at doses which will not harm the patient .
often the obstacle faced by doctors has been that , in order to have any effect , it is necessary to give very high doses of their gene therapy - which can cause problems .
it may be many years before effective gene therapies even for single-gene disorders can be developed for older patients .

when the viruses and the stem cells were put together , the viruses " infected " the stem cells .
retroviruses reproduce by incorporating their own genetic code into the code of the cell they have infected , and waiting for the cell to reproduce - reproducing their genes with it .
so , the new version of the gene spliced into the retrovirus was inserted into the make-up of the stem cell .
the result was a sample of bone marrow cells with a fully-functional gene .
these cells were injected back into rhys - and started working properly , dividing into the correct immune system cells , and helping him fight disease .
has this been done before ?
yes .
a team of experts at a paris hospital has carried out the procedure on a few babies , starting in 2000 .
their results have been similarly impressive .
this is the first treatment of its kind in the uk .
why is this exciting for scientists researching other gene therapies ?
faulty genes are responsible for , or greatly contribute to , many other serious illnesses .
hundreds of scientists worldwide are trying to find ways to use the same principles to tackle them .
this treatment for scid is one of the first successful examples of gene therapy , proving that , in principle , if you can get to the cells you want to change , you may be able to treat previously intractable illnesses .
can this advance be applied to other illnesses ?
the great ormond street team is hoping to apply it to other conditions similar to scid - faulty genes within bone marrow cells that affect the development of the immune system .
elsewhere , the potential of targeted gene therapy - both to correct single gene disorders , and to attack unwanted cells , such as cancer cells , is said to be immense .
however , other studies have illustrated the difficulties faced by doctors trying to develop gene therapy .
in this case , doctors were able to remove exactly the cells they wanted to change , and then alter them in a laboratory test tube before putting them back .
other teams face the challenge of getting their viruses to cells in organs deep within the body , or to cells spread throughout the body .
this means finding a carrier virus which is effective at targeting the right cells in a living , breathing , human , and at doses which will not harm the patient .
often the obstacle faced by doctors has been that , in order to have any effect , it is necessary to give very high doses of their gene therapy - which can cause problems .
it may be many years before effective gene therapies even for single-gene disorders can be developed for older patients .

but the message from washington has become increasingly confused .
president bush continues to defend israel 's current military action .
at the same time , colin powell and the state department bureaucracy work to try to restrain the israeli government .
today mr powell called on the israelis not to send yasser arafat into exile .
pressure " sending him into exile will just give him another place from which to conduct the same kinds of activities and give the same messages he is giving now , " he said .
" so , until he decides that he 's going to leave the country , it seems to me we need to work with him where he is , and where he is in ramallah . "
those sort of mixed messages have contributed to the pressure on the administration to take a more active role .
the senior democratic senators , joe biden and joseph lieberman , and the influential republican arlen spector , have all been calling for more action by president bush .
they want new political discussions to go alongside the ceasefire negotiations being pursued fruitlessly by the us mediator anthony zinni .
some people would also like colin powell himself to travel to the region .

every time he has tried to make a gesture towards yasser arafat it has been met with just more palestinian violence .
and mr powell 's hands are tied by the more hardline members of the administration , who want to cut off all ties with the palestinian leader .
president bush himself sees the middle east conflict as part of the war on terror - with yasser arafat as a terrorist in all but name .
mr bush feels he has no reason to change a largely pro-israeli policy that has the overwhelming support of congress and the american people .
" the polls are supporting what the president is doing , and they are also supporting what the israelis are doing , " explained judith kipper , a middle east analyst in washington .
" clearly , on a strategic level , the administration has made a decision that it is not now in the american interest to intervene more forcefully . "
there is no sign that is about to change , much to the disappointment of most of america 's allies .

as part of a deal , philip morris would become the owner of about a quarter of sab and agree not to sell the stake immediately , the wall street journal said .
a combination of sab and miller would create the world 's second largest brewer .
the group would include sab 's pilsner urquell and castle lager as well as miller 's own brand beers and its milwaukee brands .
expansion an sab spokesman told bbc news online that he could not comment on speculation .
but he pointed out that " sab has -lsb- already -rsb- grown to become the third largest brewer in the world and we have grown by acquisition " .
as a consequence rumours about merger talks involving sab have been rife .
previous rumours of merger talks between sab and miller have included scottish & newcastle in the uk .
such a deal would create a new world leader in the brewery sector , overtaking anheuser-busch and heineken , according to us press reports .
" we are busy acquirers , " acknowledged the sab spokesman .
sab has been focusing on the markets in africa including south africa , central america , china , india , and eastern europe including russia .
