the north 's action is seen as a deliberate provocation , with many papers wondering why . "
north 's military provocation can not be tolerated " tong-a ilbo there 's plenty of blame to go round , though , and the south 's " sunshine policy " of engagement draws some flak .
" it is deplorable and worrisome that we could have lost so hopelessly , " laments a military analyst in choson ilbo .
" this provocation seems to have been planned from the start , " declares the comment in the strongly nationalistic daily .
the more moderate tong-a ilbo agrees , headlining an editorial " north 's military provocation can not be tolerated " .
betrayed " we feel deeply betrayed by north korea , " it says , calling for an apology lest the north become " further isolated from the world community . "
it goes on to question the conciliatory line pursued towards the north by president kim dae-jung 's government .
" we can not but doubt the reliability of the sunshine policy , " it says . "
stop courtship of the north 's kim jong-il regime and take firm action " choson ilbo the korea times expects the incident to " put a damper " on cross-border engagement - one it says the president can hardly afford .
it speculates that the exchange may have " shattered kim 's strong belief in the wisdom of the sunshine policy " .
" few would fail to understand the reason if president kim heaved a sigh of despair , " the english-language paper concludes .
choson ilbo is less understanding , calling on the government to see the north for what it is .
" the kim dae-jung government has to stop its courtship of the north 's kim jong-il regime and take firm action , " says the paper , known for an anti-north korean line .
chungang ilbo takes a similar line on the " premeditated act of provocation " .
it warns that if the response is seen as soft so as to favour the engagement policy , " the government will be brought to grim judgment by the people . "
choson ilbo ca n't help but wonder why the north took such a step , when it is the " greatest beneficiary " of the sunshine policy .
bad timing it is especially offended by the timing - coinciding with south korea 's last game at the world cup finals .
calling the hosting of the finals a " precious experience ... we would n't give up for anything " it accuses the north of " trying to trample on this great sense of accomplishment and pride " . "
the military 's posture of confrontation with the south holds sway over the north korean leadership " chungang ilbo it wonders if pyongyang 's leaders - who talk about putting korean brethren first - are worth having dialogue with .
tong-a ilbo speculates that hardliners - including the leadership - may have been expressing discontent at the south 's rising profile , further boosted by hosting the world cup .
meanwhile , the paper notes that " the north 's image has been greatly damaged by continuous incidents involving north korean escapees " .
it also suggests that it was an " intentional demonstration " ahead of the reopening of talks with the united states .
chungang ilbo says that the world cup " bound the korean people into one " and that the north wanted to " let the world know that tensions still persist on the korean peninsula " .
it adds that north korean leader kim jong-il must have known of the incident , showing that " the military 's posture of confrontation with the south holds sway over the north korean leadership " .
firm response therefore , seoul must " resolutely call north korea to account " , the paper says .
the other papers also demand a firm response . "
the clash will not lead to serious repercussions " tour agency official the korea times suggests that humanitarian assistance - chiefly food aid to the north 's starving poor - might be halted .
tong-a ilbo calls for " strong and firm counter steps so as to keep north korea from committing any further ' aggressive ' acts " .
be that as it may , in the immediate aftermath things continued very much as usual : a few hours after the incident , a cruise ship carrying southern tourists set off for the north 's mount kumgang resort .
according to the korea times , hyundai isan , which runs the joint project , consulted the authorities and let it sail .
" learning from similar incidents in the past , we determine that the clash will not lead to serious repercussions , " an official for the tour operator said .

should nhs patients be treated in private hospitals ?
and should they be sent abroad for treatment ?
these are some of the thorny issues facing the health service today - and they 'll top the agenda at this year 's british medical association conference in harrogate .
breakfast spoke to one patient , john mccaul , who spent two years on an nhs waiting list before being one of the pioneer group of patients to be treated in france earlier this year .
a lack of training places is delaying doctors becoming gps - and that is not the only nhs staffing problem , the british medical association has said ahead of its annual conference .
recruitment and retention of nhs staff has become a major problem for the government in recent months .
it was reported on sunday that ministers ' plans to boost the nhs with overseas staff have run into trouble , sparking complaints from 19 foreign governments .
the bma - the doctors ' trade union - found that among 500 medical graduates who qualified in 1995 , many were having to alter their career plans because of the shortage of training places .
while waiting for a training place some doctors were going into research posts or studying for a further degree , the report said .
others were working as locums or taking up posts which had no training content .
assisted suicide the study is one of a number of topics being raised during the bma 's annual conference , attended by 500 delegates , in harrogate this week .
other subjects up for discussion include vaccines for nhs staff in the case of germ warfare ; cctv in surgeries ; the mmr vaccine and assisted suicide .
on sunday the bma will publish the findings of a mori poll which asked patients what they thought about government proposals to treat more people overseas or in private hospitals .
the proposals are among health secretary alan milburn 's plans to cut waiting times in the nhs .
other plans , published this week , include recruiting overseas staff for staff private sector facilities that treat nhs patients .
refugee doctors but the mail on sunday reported that that idea could already be in trouble , with countries both in and out of the eu complaining about the uk 's aggressive recruitment of staff during the last year .
the department of health said it did not recruit from developing countries with a shortage of medical staff .
the bma has said it is ironic that despite the nhs staff shortages , refugee doctors face huge hurdles to using their skills in the uk .
most refugee doctors , no matter how qualified , have to begin their training all over again when they come to britain - a process which can take up to 10 years .
the bma has said refugee doctors are a valuable resource and should be integrated into the nhs .
this will be another subject up for discussion at the conference .

six officers were injured during clashes with nationalist protestors , who were angry that the orange order had been allowed to parade through their streets .
the security forces were pelted with stones and used water cannon to disperse the protestors .
the violence followed an orange order parade a crowd of about 300 nationalists confronted the police as the marchers passed through the junction of ainsworth avenue and march street and the junction of springfield parade and springfield road .
sean paul o 'hare , of springfield residents ' action group , said : " i think that these disturbances were an indication of just how angry people in the community are .
" they were angry at this decision to allow the march through with no route restriction and feel the parades commission have put the community into a corner .
" we went to them with positive proposals and those were rejected . "
peace process meetings sinn fein president gerry adams will hold talks in dublin on monday with irish prime minister bertie ahern on the problems in the peace process , it emerged on saturday .
adams : wants to end " republicanism by force " the meeting comes just days before uk prime minister tony blair and mr ahern travel to northern ireland for an emergency meeting with the pro-good friday agreement parties to bolster the strained peace process .
sinn fein said the meeting would review progress made so far in implementing the good friday agreement .
caoimhghin o 'caolain , the leader of sinn fein in the irish parliament , said there had been a " serious escalation in loyalist-orchestrated sectarian attacks " in belfast .
but ulster unionists have accused republicans of orchestrating street clashes in the city .
on saturday night mr adams insisted he would continue playing " a leadership role " in trying to end republican violence .
he insisted republicans had " no truck with sectarianism of any kind or from any source " , and said everyone should be able to live free from sectarian harassment .
' disgraceful scenes ' the northern ireland parades commission did not impose any route restrictions on saturday 's parade .
however , it said no music must be played between the junction of ainsworth avenue and march street and the junction of springfield parade and springfield road .
the commission said it was conscious of its previous decisions about the parade , but considering all relevant factors , felt it was " the most appropriate for this particular parade at this particular time " .

six officers were injured during clashes with nationalist protestors , who were angry that the orange order had been allowed to parade through their streets .
the security forces were pelted with stones and used water cannon to disperse the protestors .
a crowd of about 300 nationalists confronted the police as the marchers passed through the junction of ainsworth avenue and march street and the junction of springfield parade and springfield road .
sean paul o 'hare , of springfield residents ' action group , said : " i think that these disturbances were an indication of just how angry people in the community are .
" they were angry at this decision to allow the march through with no route restriction and feel the parades commission have put the community into a corner .
" we went to them with positive proposals and those were rejected . "
peace process meetings sinn fein president gerry adams will hold talks in dublin on monday with irish prime minister bertie ahern on the problems in the peace process , it emerged on saturday .
the meeting comes just days before uk prime minister tony blair and mr ahern travel to northern ireland for an emergency meeting with the pro-good friday agreement parties to bolster the strained peace process .
sinn fein said the meeting would review progress made so far in implementing the good friday agreement .
caoimhghin o 'caolain , the leader of sinn fein in the irish parliament , said there had been a " serious escalation in loyalist-orchestrated sectarian attacks " in belfast .
but ulster unionists have accused republicans of orchestrating street clashes in the city .
on saturday night mr adams insisted he would continue playing " a leadership role " in trying to end republican violence .
he insisted republicans had " no truck with sectarianism of any kind or from any source " , and said everyone should be able to live free from sectarian harassment .
' disgraceful scenes ' the northern ireland parades commission did not impose any route restrictions on saturday 's parade .
however , it said no music must be played between the junction of ainsworth avenue and march street and the junction of springfield parade and springfield road .
the commission said it was conscious of its previous decisions about the parade , but considering all relevant factors , felt it was " the most appropriate for this particular parade at this particular time " .
the police said they had received assurances that the nationalist counter-protest would be marshalled .
but they said they were told there would be no marshals 30 minutes before the march was due to pass .
assistant chief constable for belfast alan mcquillan said the decision to withdraw marshalling " directly led " to the " disgraceful " scenes later .

the surrey force 's investigation had been described as " chaotic and aimless " by an independent police inquiry , according to the sunday mirror .
it reports that the head of the inquiry , detective inspector stuart gibson , was replaced by detective inspector brian marjoram , an expert on paedophiles .
detective chief inspector stuart gibson has demonstrated a huge commitment to the inquiry surrey police amanda dowler , a 13-year-old also known as " milly " , disappeared while walking home from the train station at walton-on-thames on 21 march .
the newspaper says the sussex police inquiry into the handling of the case was " highly critical " and " made it clear that urgent and dramatic changes needed to be made " .
the paper reported that mistakes made by the force included taking more than a month to carry out a detailed forensic examination of milly 's clothing , failing to treat her disappearance from the outset as a potential murder inquiry and waiting weeks to examine her computer .
surrey police has rejected this and said the force had always treated the case as a " serious and critical incident " .
it said in a statement : " it is standard procedure with an inquiry this size for other forces to be requested to review the work of the investigation team .
" in this case sussex police was asked to conduct those reviews .

the police added : " detective chief inspector stuart gibson has demonstrated a huge commitment to the inquiry .
" dci gibson is also the divisional senior detective for north surrey division .

milly 's mother , sally , said last week that they were trying to stay positive for the sake of the missing teen 's sister gemma .
she expressed surprise that nothing had been uncovered and said : " when milly first went missing we would never have believed that we would have had no news of her by now . "
a surrey police spokesman said on sunday : " it is an extremely unusual incident for a girl to go missing without a single clue or lead to help the investigation team .
" regardless of how the investigation is technically classified , the same meticulous , painstaking and thorough approach would have been taken . "
two men have been arrested and released on bail without charge in connection with milly 's disappearance .

"
sunday 's advertisement begins with verses of the koran stressing respect for human life " the advertisement describes bin laden and 17 of his associates as terrorists and seeks the people 's help with information leading to their capture .
the advertisement does not offer any reward , unlike a similar advertisement published on saturday .
in this , pakistani police published photographs of 10 alleged militants suspected of carrying out the recent deadly bombings in the southern city of karachi .
that advertisement , accompanied by photographs of the 10 suspects , offered rewards of up to 20m rupees -lrb- $ 320,000 -rrb- and was carried by several local papers .
secrecy assured sunday 's advertisement seeking information leading to the arrest of al-qaeda leaders begins with verses of the koran stressing respect for human life .
these are followed by photographs of bin laden , his senior lieutenant amin al-zwaheri , and 16 others .
this is the first advertisement issued by the pakistani government seeking their arrest .
it has asked the people of pakistan to help with information leading to the apprehension of these men , describing them for the first time as terrorists .
the advertisement assures potential informants that the special telephone lines opened for the purpose are being manned by army officers and that the identities of informants will be kept secret .
continuing manhunt saturday 's advertisement offered rewards for information leading to the arrest of people suspected of involvement in the murder of us journalist daniel pearl , and two massive bomb attacks .
in the first of these , a number of french naval engineers who were helping the pakistani navy build a submarine , were killed when their bus was blown up .
the second attack , close to the us consulate-general in karachi , did not hurt any foreigners , but killed and injured a number of pakistanis .
the advertisements appear shortly after 10 pakistani soldiers were killed in a gun battle with suspected al-qaeda fighters in pakistan 's north-western frontiers close to afghanistan .
a large number of pakistani troops with reported help from us personnel are combing the mountainous tribal territories in search of al-qaeda fighters and their leaders .

recruitment and retention of nhs staff has become a major problem for the government in recent months .
the bma - the doctors ' trade union - found that among 500 medical graduates who qualified in 1995 , many were having to alter their career plans because of the shortage of training places .
while waiting for a training place some doctors were going into research posts or studying for a further degree , the report said .
others were working as locums or taking up posts which had no training content .
assisted suicide the study is one of a number of issues being raised during the bma 's annual conference , attended by 500 delegates , in harrogate this week .
other subjects due for discussion include vaccines for nhs staff in the case of germ warfare ; cctv in surgeries ; the mmr vaccine and assisted suicide .
on sunday the bma will publish the findings of a mori poll which asked patients what they thought about government proposals to treat more people overseas or in private hospitals .
the proposals are among health secretary alan milburn 's plans to cut waiting times in the nhs .
other plans , published this week , include recruiting overseas staff for staff private sector facilities that treat nhs patients .
refugee doctors the department of health denied sunday newspaper reports that the policy had run into trouble .
it had been suggested some countries had complained to the government about its aggressive recruitment of overseas health service staff .
but in a statement , the department of health said : " we have not received a single complaint . "
it added : " we are working in conjunction with these countries to ethically recruit staff .
we have had warm support from developing countries regarding our ethical international recruitment . "
the bma has said it is ironic that despite the nhs staff shortages , refugee doctors face huge hurdles to using their skills in the uk .
most refugee doctors , no matter how qualified , have to begin their training all over again when they come to britain - a process which can take up to 10 years .
the bma has said refugee doctors are a valuable resource and should be integrated into the nhs .
this will be another subject up for discussion at the conference .

other plans , published this week , include recruiting overseas staff for staff private sector facilities that treat nhs patients .
refugee doctors the department of health denied sunday newspaper reports that the policy had run into trouble .
it had been suggested some countries had complained to the government about its aggressive recruitment of overseas health service staff .
but in a statement , the department of health said : " we have not received a single complaint . "
it added : " we are working in conjunction with these countries to ethically recruit staff .
we have had warm support from developing countries regarding our ethical international recruitment . "
the bma has said it is ironic that despite the nhs staff shortages , refugee doctors face huge hurdles to using their skills in the uk .
most refugee doctors , no matter how qualified , have to begin their training all over again when they come to britain - a process which can take up to 10 years .
the bma has said refugee doctors are a valuable resource and should be integrated into the nhs .
this will be another subject up for discussion at the conference . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's christine stewart " a shortage of nhs beds and doctors are now major concerns for the medical profession " see also : 25 jun 02 -pipe- health foreign doctors to bolster nhs 22 feb 02 -pipe- health nhs recruits german doctors 21 may 01 -pipe- health nurses criticise overseas recruitment 03 may 01 -pipe- health surge in foreign nurse applications 23 apr 01 -pipe- health uk ' draining third world of nurses ' internet links : british medical association department of health nhs the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top health stories now : heart risk link to big families back pain drug ' may aid diabetics ' congo ebola outbreak confirmed vegetables ward off alzheimer 's polio campaign launched in iraq gene defect explains high blood pressure botox ' may cause new wrinkles ' alien ' abductees ' show real symptoms links to more health stories are at the foot of the page .

sunday 's advertisement begins with verses of the koran stressing respect for human life the advertisement describes bin laden and 17 of his associates as terrorists and seeks the people 's help with information leading to their capture .
the advertisement does not offer any reward , unlike a similar advertisement published on saturday .
in this , pakistani police published photographs of 10 alleged militants suspected of carrying out the recent deadly bombings in the southern city of karachi .
that advertisement , accompanied by photographs of the 10 suspects , offered rewards of up to 20m rupees -lrb- $ 320,000 -rrb- and was carried by several local papers .
secrecy assured sunday 's advertisement seeking information leading to the arrest of al-qaeda leaders begins with verses of the koran stressing respect for human life .
some senior al-qaeda members are already in custody these are followed by photographs of bin laden , his senior lieutenant amin al-zwaheri , and 16 others .
this is the first advertisement issued by the pakistani government seeking their arrest .
it has asked the people of pakistan to help with information leading to the apprehension of these men , describing them for the first time as terrorists .
the advertisement assures potential informants that the special telephone lines opened for the purpose are being manned by army officers and that the identities of informants will be kept secret .
continuing manhunt saturday 's advertisement offered rewards for information leading to the arrest of people suspected of involvement in the murder of us journalist daniel pearl , and two massive bomb attacks .
police are also hunting pakistani militants in the first of these , a number of french naval engineers who were helping the pakistani navy build a submarine , were killed when their bus was blown up .
the second attack , close to the us consulate-general in karachi , did not hurt any foreigners , but killed and injured a number of pakistanis .
the advertisements appear shortly after 10 pakistani soldiers were killed in a gun battle with suspected al-qaeda fighters in pakistan 's north-western frontiers close to afghanistan .
a large number of pakistani troops with reported help from us personnel are combing the mountainous tribal territories in search of al-qaeda fighters and their leaders .

mandy power , 34 , her disabled 80-year-old mother and her daughters katie , 10 , and emily , eight , were battered to death three years ago when builder david morris embarked on an " orgy of savagery " .
the prayers on sunday morning at st mary 's church in clydach , near swansea , aim to heal some of the emotional wounds uncovered by the horrifying details revealed during the 11-week trial .
and the man leading the service has called on the community to continue to show courage and patience as the reality of morris 's conviction - by a unanimous 11-person jury - sinks in .
fresh floral tributes marking the third anniversary last thursday of the brutal killings have been laid outside the family 's home in kelvin road .
tim hewitt , vicar at st mary 's , held the funeral for the four victims and was asked by relatives to be their media spokesman in the weeks following the tragedy .
he said the loss of mrs power and her family is still affecting the community .
but his advice for his congregation is to continue watching the course of the judicial process unfold .
the village a few miles north of swansea is divided over morris 's conviction for the extraordinarily vicious crime which shocked the nation .
some still point the finger at mrs power 's secret lover , alison lewis , who was a serving policewoman at the time of the murders .
she along with her ex-husband and his twin brother , also both serving police officers were held in july 2000 and questioned about the killings .
friday 's unanimous jury verdict has done little to quell suspicions that people other than morris were involved in either the killings or the near-successful attempt to clean the scene of forensic evidence .
in addition , morris 's family have said they believe the craig cefn parc builder has good grounds to mount an appeal .
it is against this background that rev hewitt believes the community has struck the right balance of grieving for those who suffered while letting the legal process work its course .
he said : " i think they have learnt to be patient and to show courage , and to wait for things to take their course .
" and i think the community will carry on it that way , being patient .
" when it wants to draw a line under the events , what i think it wants to do is to have the time and the space to begin a new step forward . "

mr ouattara , who is from the largely muslim north of the country , said he was pleased with the move , which comes after two years of controversy over his status .
the courts banned ouattara from running in elections " i 'm satisfied and happy at obtaining my nationality certificate .
the judges have done the right thing , " mr ouattara said .
the decision does not mean that mr ouattara will necessarily be able to challenge president laurent gbagbo in an election .
the country 's constitution bars people who have held the citizenship of another country from standing as presidential candidates .
but correspondents say the decision to grant mr ouattara citizenship has still angered mr gbagbo 's supporters , causing protests on the streets of ivory coast 's main city , abidjan , on saturday night .
the issue has led to repeated street battles between mr ouattara 's supporters and those of the president that have left hundreds of people dead .
mr ouattara , a former prime minister , was barred from standing in presidential elections in 2000 on the grounds that he was granted citizenship of neighbouring burkina faso .
muslim north many of his supporters are muslims from the north of the country .
they complain that the government has been trying to deprive many of them of citizenship by claiming that they have migrated to ivory coast in search of greater prosperity in the world 's largest cocoa-producing country .
their complaints have led to increasing tension with government supporters from the mainly christian south .
at least six people were killed and more than 30 wounded in two days of clashes since violence flared at an election rally in daloa last week .

mr ouattara , who is from the largely muslim north of the country , said he was pleased with the move , which comes after two years of controversy over his status .
" i 'm satisfied and happy at obtaining my nationality certificate .
the judges have done the right thing , " mr ouattara said .
the decision does not mean that mr ouattara will necessarily be able to challenge president laurent gbagbo in an election .
the country 's constitution bars people who have held the citizenship of another country from standing as presidential candidates .
but correspondents say the decision to grant mr ouattara citizenship has still angered mr gbagbo 's supporters , causing protests on the streets of ivory coast 's main city , abidjan , on saturday night .
the issue has led to repeated street battles between mr ouattara 's supporters and those of the president that have left hundreds of people dead .
mr ouattara , a former prime minister , was barred from standing in presidential elections in 2000 on the grounds that he was granted citizenship of neighbouring burkina faso .
muslim north many of his supporters are muslims from the north of the country .
they complain that the government has been trying to deprive many of them of citizenship by claiming that they have migrated to ivory coast in search of greater prosperity in the world 's largest cocoa-producing country .
their complaints have led to increasing tension with government supporters from the mainly christian south .
at least six people were killed and more than 30 wounded in two days of clashes since violence flared at an election rally in daloa last week .
a curfew is to remain in place until 15 july , a week after local elections , and public meetings have been banned until 3 july .
ethnic tensions have risen since the arrival of northerners in daloa - ethnic dioula muslims who tend to support mr ouattara and his rdr party .

the three members of chart-topping girl group mis-teeq were jumping around and pumping out their hits on stage in the dance tent - and the big crowd was giving the group one of the most rapturous receptions of the weekend .
nobody can accuse glastonbury of not appealing to all tastes .
many of the fans that were not watching mis-teeq on saturday night were either at the pyramid stage for headliners stereophonics , one of the most biggest rock acts in the uk at the moment , or watching dance djs orbital , who are festival favourites , on the second stage .
if those acts still did not appeal , at the same time french world music star manu chao was headlining the jazz / world stage and drum ' n ' bass perennials dreadzone were in the glade , while former led zeppelin star robert plant had just finished playing with his new band on the acoustic stage .

their cd , my place in the dust , was adored by some critics but ignored by the public .
only a handful of people in the avalon cafÃ© had heard of them beforehand - but many more discovered them here , and unexpected surprises like that help make glastonbury so special .
saturday 's line-up was full of intriguing prospects , and after morning star 's performance , it was a short walk to watch french algerian singer rachid taha in the jazz / world arena .
looking like he should be algeria 's answer to robbie williams , it was a fair bet that there was no-one else like him playing during the weekend .
wearing amazing technicolour trousers , he added heavy rock guitars and techno beats to traditional algerian rhythms to produce songs that could be quite hypnotising .
glastonbury is also a good place to size up new bands who could be the headliners of the future .
hype there were several hotly-tipped groups playing on saturday evening , beginning with young punky australian trio the vines , who have had the title of " the new nirvana " placed on their shoulders by the music press .
disappointingly , they failed to ignite the large crowd who had turned out to see whether they could live up to the hype .
maybe it was just the fact that the sky had suddenly gone grey and the sound was being blown away .
or maybe they just were n't very good after all .
also tipped for big things were the more impressive leeds quartet the music , who did their best to call forth the psychedelic spirits of led zeppelin and the stone roses in the new bands tent .
and many fans got their first glimpse of the white stripes , relative newcomers but one of the most enigmatic and exciting bands of the weekend , with a prestigious evening slot on the pyramid stage .
the detroit duo of jack and meg white continue to keep fans guessing about whether they are man and wife , or brother and sister - but whatever the chemistry between them , it worked at glastonbury .
yelping out his raw blues vocals , jack was part elvis presley , part jimi hendrix and part frank ' n ' furter .
by the time mis-teeq took the stage in the dance tent at 2300 bst , most dance fans who had been fixtures in there over the weekend had moved to watch orbital , and were replaced by pop-lovers , kids and townies who had somehow strayed into the somerset countryside .
mis-teeq are unlikely to gain the credibility that tom jones , rolf harris and tony bennett earned from glastonbury shows because nobody in the crowd was being the slightest bit ironic , and the group have not been around long enough to become cult worship material .
they were one of the most charismatic and energetic groups here , and they certainly out-performed some of the rock bands .

few scotsmen know exactly how to wear their national dress , according to a new book .
some even commit one of the worst crimes imaginable - by wearing coloured y-fronts under their kilts .
wallace lockhart , who has spent two years researching the scottish wedding , found that " almost all scots " made basic errors such as wearing the wrong style of jacket .
he partly blames improperly trained kilt hire shop assistants for giving wearers the wrong advice .
mr lockhart , 75 , said : " the kilt used to be a much more common form of dress among young people .
socks are often worn too high " now , men want to wear the national costume but they do n't have a natural feel for it so they wear the kilt far too long and pull their stockings far too high .
" i have even seen men wearing flat caps with formal highland dress .
" one of the problems is that so many scots go to hire shops where the assistant may never have worn the kilt in his life .
" certainly , most will never talk about the flashes in any depth or how to tie the laces .
white boxers " if there is one thing that shows highland dress is not the wearer 's traditional apparel , it is the stockings .
" how often one sees them pulled up almost over the knee , far removed from the highland tradition of ' a hand 's breadth below ' . "
in the book , mr lockhart writes : " the sgian dhu -lrb- skeen doo -rrb- , which was once carried under the arm in a hidden shoulder holster , should now be worn on the outside of the leg of the right stocking , unless the wearer is left-handed .
jacobean shirts are making a comeback " contrary to popular belief , there are no rules about what to wear under the kilt .
" it is purely down to personal taste but you 'd look stupid in white boxer shorts .
most scotsmen usually wear coloured y-fronts . "
the now-traditional highland dress became scotland 's national costume in 1822 after the visit to edinburgh of king george iv .
mr lockhart , who has welcomed the return of jacobean shirts and plaid , said : " the king 's kilt was a little on the short side and his pink tights would find little support today . "
the scottish wedding is published in august by luath press .

analysis by graham turner gfc economics nearly a year ago - well before enron , worldcom and other scandals - graham turner warned that the us economy was driven by a huge bubble of artificially inflated profits .
writing for bbc news online , he explains why these corporate misdeeds are just the tip of the iceberg .
the recent spate of accounting scandals in the us has left many investors dismayed and perplexed .
it was not so long ago that us companies were routinely reporting double-digit growth in their earnings as the stock markets soared repeatedly to new heights .
but in truth , even then it was not difficult to see that us corporates were their cooking the books .
investors did not have to look far to realise that the profit figures put out by many companies in the late 1990s were inflated .
now the chickens are coming home to roost , investors are entitled to ask how many more skeletons may be lurking in the cupboard ?
the government 's own profit figures detailed in the national accounts , showed that companies were never making the money that they claimed .
during the last five years of the bull market , the companies that make up the s & p500 reported that profits had risen by 96.2 % .
by contrast , the government 's own figures revealed that corporate sector profits had only risen by 36.1 % .
the figures implied that us companies could be overstating profits growth by more than 150 % .
inconvenient facts the national accounts figures were hardly a secret .
but they were largely overlooked by analysts who wanted to believe that the us was enjoying a profit boom on the back of a productivity renaissance .
the facts were too troublesome for those who vehemently believed that the us economy had been transformed by corporate restructuring during the early 1990s .
so instead it was claimed that the national accounts data cover the entire gamut of quoted and unquoted companies .
the data , the argument went , was therefore not representative of the select companies that made up the s & p500 .
too many cooks in part that was true , but it also disguised an important point .
productivity gains can boost profits .
but in an environment of low inflation and low nominal gdp growth , double-digit profit growth is only going to be possible if workers are taking home a smaller slice of the national income pie .
as it was , the us was operating close to full employment and wages were being bid up .
the share of national income taken by workers was going up .
the corporate sector could not be securing a bigger part of national income cake too .
there was something inconsistent about the claims of us companies that they were boosting their earnings so sharply .
rotten apples ?
of course , now we know that companies were indeed inflating their earnings .
some analysts are still clinging to the belief that enron , worldcom , xerox , qwest - to name but a few - were exceptions to the rule .
a laid-off worldcom employee leaves his office for the last time it may well be that only a minority of companies were engaged in fraudulent accountancy .
we shall have to wait and see .
but in some sense , that is still missing the point .

writing for bbc news online , he explains why these corporate misdeeds are just the tip of the iceberg .
the recent spate of accounting scandals in the us has left many investors dismayed and perplexed .
it was not so long ago that us companies were routinely reporting double-digit growth in their earnings as the stock markets soared repeatedly to new heights .
but in truth , even then it was not difficult to see that us corporates were their cooking the books .
investors did not have to look far to realise that the profit figures put out by many companies in the late 1990s were inflated . "
now the chickens are coming home to roost , investors are entitled to ask how many more skeletons may be lurking in the cupboard ? "
the government 's own profit figures detailed in the national accounts , showed that companies were never making the money that they claimed .
during the last five years of the bull market , the companies that make up the s & p500 reported that profits had risen by 96.2 % .
by contrast , the government 's own figures revealed that corporate sector profits had only risen by 36.1 % .
the figures implied that us companies could be overstating profits growth by more than 150 % .
inconvenient facts the national accounts figures were hardly a secret .
but they were largely overlooked by analysts who wanted to believe that the us was enjoying a profit boom on the back of a productivity renaissance .
the facts were too troublesome for those who vehemently believed that the us economy had been transformed by corporate restructuring during the early 1990s .
so instead it was claimed that the national accounts data cover the entire gamut of quoted and unquoted companies .
the data , the argument went , was therefore not representative of the select companies that made up the s & p500 .
too many cooks in part that was true , but it also disguised an important point .
productivity gains can boost profits .
but in an environment of low inflation and low nominal gdp growth , double-digit profit growth is only going to be possible if workers are taking home a smaller slice of the national income pie .
as it was , the us was operating close to full employment and wages were being bid up .
the share of national income taken by workers was going up .
the corporate sector could not be securing a bigger part of national income cake too .
there was something inconsistent about the claims of us companies that they were boosting their earnings so sharply .
rotten apples ?
of course , now we know that companies were indeed inflating their earnings .
some analysts are still clinging to the belief that enron , worldcom , xerox , qwest - to name but a few - were exceptions to the rule .
it may well be that only a minority of companies were engaged in fraudulent accountancy .
we shall have to wait and see .
but in some sense , that is still missing the point .
many other ruses were being used to inflate profit numbers .
the discrepancy between the national accounts data was not just the result of accounting irregularities .
the indiscriminate use of stock options , which effectively allow a company to take staff costs off-balance sheet , have long been used to inflate earnings - as well as provide ' incentives ' .
the habitual pension holiday was also another ruse that allowed companies to flatter profits .

the shadow home secretary said children were falling prey to drugs gangs partly through a lack of support , discipline and affection in the home . "
we want to be tough but tough with being tender " oliver letwin but he said tackling those kind of social issues had to be balanced with reforms to the youth justice system and measures to ensure more police were on the streets .
mr letwin denied that his approach to law and order put him at odds with the right of the tory party .
former conservative chairman lord tebbit has in the past compared mr letwin 's approach to that of a " hampstead liberal " .
tories were " very much like the rest of the population - decent , tolerant , humane but desperately concerned to see the criminals brought under control , to see decent citizens back in charge of our neighbourhoods , " mr letwin told bbc one 's breakfast with frost programme .
" i think conservatives want to see police on our streets .
" they want to see reform of our youth justice system so that we do n't have people just recycling through our young offenders institutions and back out the other side to commit crimes .
" these are common goals of conservatives - there 's not debate in the conservative party about that kind of thing . "
lack of affection ?
he added : " we share a common agenda of working to get the decent citizen back in charge of our society but we also recognise that means attending to things like family life and bringing up children properly .
" we want to be tough but tough with being tender . "
mr letwin expressed concern about drug abuse among the young and he highlighted the softer approach to cannabis being taken in lambeth , south london , as an example of letting the gangs take over .
he attributed drug abuse amongst young people in part to a lack of discipline and of affection in the home .
the tough but tender approach is reminiscent of the stance adopted by tony blair when he was shadow home secretary in the early 1990s .
mr blair famously said that labour should be " tough on crime , tough on the causes of crime " .
