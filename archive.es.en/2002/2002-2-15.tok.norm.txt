a team of researchers discovered a drug which stops the disease from spreading by preventing malaria parasites from reproducing .
we have tested this ... against human malaria in monkeys and it works dr henri vial , malaria researcher the disease is one of the most prevalent and deadly in the world , affecting about half a billion people each year , according to the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .
the new drug could be available for testing on human beings within about two years , reports the american journal science .
until now , most anti-malaria drugs have only had limited effectiveness and new strains of the disease have developed which are resistant to treatment .
the team of european and south african scientists said the new drug , called g25 , completely cured monkeys infected with the disease in laboratory experiments .
parasites malaria is transmitted to victims by blood-sucking mosquitoes .
african countries are particularly affected by malaria microscopic parasites enter the victim 's blood stream and liver , where they multiply , before entering red blood cells .
there they continue to reproduce , burst the blood cells and infect more red blood cells in an ongoing process .
the parasites can eventually kill 70 % of blood cells , causing anaemia , coma and death .
g25 blocks the parasites ' ability to multiply in the blood cells by preventing it from making protective membrane , crucial to the parasites ' life cycle .
malaria 500m cases each year 1.5m to 2.7m deaths 90 % of cases in africa team leader dr henri vial , from the french national centre of scientific research , said the new drug killed all the parasites within two days .
other studies suggest that the parasite failed to develop resistance to the new drug , even though researchers encouraged it to do so .
malaria kills almost 3m people , mostly in africa and southeast asia , each year , according to who figures .
one of the main drawbacks to g25 is that it has to be injected , although tablet form should be available within two years .
" for people from africa or from asia it is more safe to take the drug orally , " said mr vial .
mr vial said that while it worked well , g25 was not the definitive cure and work was already under way to develop an improved version .

the move clears the way for princess shareholders to consider an alternative $ 3.8bn takeover bid from rival cruise operator carnival , which has been muscling its way into the deal .
the adjournment , which required the support of investors holding a simple majority of princess shares , was backed by investors holding 253 million shares with 151.8 million cast against .
carnival chief executive micky arison said he was " delighted " with the outcome .
" we would like to thank the p & o princess shareholders for their support throughout this process , and look forward to welcoming them as shareholders of the enlarged carnival group in the future , " he said in a statement .
in the city , princess shares edged slightly higher on the news , climbing 2.75p to 401.75p.
walkout threat the princess / royal caribbean merger would create a $ 7bn cruise liner operation , overtaking carnival as the world 's biggest cruise ship company .
but delaying the shareholder vote on the merger may prompt royal caribbean to pull out of the deal .
" i want to be very clear - if there is no approval of the p & o / royal caribbean combination ... there will , for any number of reasons , be no deals , " royal caribbean chairman and chief executive richard fain said ahead of the vote .
all three cruise firms are keen to consolidate in order to cut costs following the post-11 september slump in tourism .
shareholder split princess directors had urged shareholders to back the proposed tie-up with royal caribbean , arguing that the carnival takeover would be more likely to run into regulatory obstacles in europe and the us .
they also suggested that carnival 's tenacity in pursuing the hostile takeover stems more from an intent to scupper the royal caribbean / princess merger and retain its top spot than from any real desire to buy princess .
but carnival 's offer clearly tempted some princess investors , with one formally proposing a motion for an adjournment at the start of thursday 's meeting .
voting results supporters of a delay said final approval of the royal caribbean deal should wait until competition watchdogs have decided whether or not there are grounds for blocking either deal .
they believe that royal caribbean is unlikely to carry out its threat to pull out of the planned merger .
to pursue the royal caribbean tie-up , p & o would need the backing of 75 % of shareholders who vote .
princess p & o has not set a date for the next shareholder ballot .

"
tissue engineering ... should help reduce the number of patients on a transplant list " dr anthony atala dr anthony atala , of the boston children 's hospital , says he hopes to put a laboratory-engineered bladder into a patient once he has obtained the necessary regulatory approval .
he believes permission for the procedure , which has been pioneered in dogs , will come within the next few months .
dr attalla says that if he is successful with the bladder transplant , he will attempt to repair damaged hearts with new muscle and possibly even try to grow a kidney .
polymer ball " i think over time there will be no limit , " dr atala said .
" i think it is just a question of figuring out all the different tissue types and cell types and how they work best , but eventually i think that following the same strategies just about every organ in the body will be repairable at the very least . "
it was exactly two years ago that a team from the laboratory for tissue engineering at the children 's hospital and harvard medical school in boston announced that it had successfully implanted six beagle dogs with lab-grown bladders .
tissue samples were taken from the animals ' original bladders and these were used to cultivate the muscle cells and special bladder skin cells , called urothelial cells , needed to construct the artificial organs .
the multiplying cells were shaped into beagle bladders by bedding them down over polymer balls .
transplanted into the dogs , these lab-grown organs allowed the animals to urinate normally .
important ally dr atala believes his technique is sufficiently well developed that it could be used to treat a young child .
a lab-grown bladder could be the answer for a patient whose own organ has been destroyed by cancer or damaged by an infection or injury .
dr atala is seeking approval for human trials from the us food and drug administration .
although tissue engineering has huge potential , dr atala believes there will always be a need for donor organs .
" i think tissue engineering is just another solution but it should help reduce the number of patients on a transplant list . "
and , he believes , tissue engineering will prove to be a useful ally to the emerging field of stem cell medicine , in which " young " cells are injected into ailing tissue to regenerate it .
" for example , with a patient who has a failing heart , where obviously it would be very hard to get a biopsy because they would not tolerate the procedure ; then i think stem cells would be the ideal answer . "

bbc news -pipe- wales -pipe- hart under fire over rogers ' claim categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : uk : wales front page world uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 15 february , 2002 , 06:50 gmt hart under fire over rogers ' claim the site is currently a fenced-off hole in the ground calls are growing for an adjudication on a legal dispute between the welsh assembly and its sacked architect richard rogers to be made public .
lord rogers has accused the assembly 's finance minister , edwina hart , of being unfair and inaccurate when she told ams that the adjudicator had ruled it was lord rogers who had underestimated the costs of a new debating chamber .
finance minister edwina hart opposition politicians claim the dispute over who said what about lord rogers design has moved beyond the project 's mismanagement and had become an issue of ministerial integrity .
the former labour welsh secretary , ron davies , who picked lord rogers ' design for the new assembly building , has added his voice to the calls for the full adjudication to be made public .
and nick bourne , the welsh assembly tory leader , has called for the assembly to be recalled from its half-term break unless the adjudication is made available .
labour 's ms hart has described the £ 432,000 legal dispute with architect lord rogers over a new debating chamber as " embarrassing " .
lord rogers ' company , the richard rogers partnership -lrb- rrp -rrb- , was sacked from the project in july 2001 because of concerns over escalating costs .
but lord rogers brought an action against the assembly , saying it owed his company unpaid fees .
lord rogers complained over unpaid fees he had claimed £ 530,000 , but the figure was reduced in the arbitration process .
ms hart admitted the matter was embarrassing , but insisted the decision to sack him was right .
she told the assembly that lord rogers had " significantly underestimated the cost of the building " .
but last night lord rogers responded with a statement to ams denying her interpretation of the adjudicator 's decision .
he said the adjudicator found no substance in the allegations when he dismissed an assembly counter claim of almost £ 7m .
library copy plaid cymru leader , ieuan wyn jones , said : " we want to know the full story - before i reach a judgement about who 's misled who , i want to see the full adjudication .
" there is a way edwina hart can do this , she can place a copy of the adjudication in the library of the assembly .
former welsh secretary ron davies " we can then reach our own judgement .
caerphilly am mr davies said : " in order to clear this dispute out of the way , we need that report published , so all of us can read it and all of us can make out our own minds and then , hopefully , we can move on . "

lord rogers has accused the assembly 's finance minister , edwina hart , of being unfair and inaccurate when she told ams that the adjudicator had ruled it was lord rogers who had underestimated the costs of a new debating chamber .
opposition politicians claim the dispute over who said what about lord rogers design has moved beyond the project 's mismanagement and had become an issue of ministerial integrity .
the former labour welsh secretary , ron davies , who picked lord rogers ' design for the new assembly building , has added his voice to the calls for the full adjudication to be made public .
and nick bourne , the welsh assembly tory leader , has called for the assembly to be recalled from its half-term break unless the adjudication is made available .
labour 's ms hart has described the £ 432,000 legal dispute with architect lord rogers over a new debating chamber as " embarrassing " .
lord rogers ' company , the richard rogers partnership -lrb- rrp -rrb- , was sacked from the project in july 2001 because of concerns over escalating costs .
but lord rogers brought an action against the assembly , saying it owed his company unpaid fees .
he had claimed £ 530,000 , but the figure was reduced in the arbitration process .
ms hart admitted the matter was embarrassing , but insisted the decision to sack him was right .
she told the assembly that lord rogers had " significantly underestimated the cost of the building " .
but last night lord rogers responded with a statement to ams denying her interpretation of the adjudicator 's decision .
he said the adjudicator found no substance in the allegations when he dismissed an assembly counter claim of almost £ 7m .
library copy plaid cymru leader , ieuan wyn jones , said : " we want to know the full story - before i reach a judgement about who 's misled who , i want to see the full adjudication .
" there is a way edwina hart can do this , she can place a copy of the adjudication in the library of the assembly .
" we can then reach our own judgement .
caerphilly am mr davies said : " in order to clear this dispute out of the way , we need that report published , so all of us can read it and all of us can make out our own minds and then , hopefully , we can move on . "
last night an assembly spokesman said edwina hart stood by everything she said and categorically denied she had misled ams .
ms hart is expected to face further questions when ams return from their half-term break .

" there is no intention to scrap the consignia name , which was introduced by the board when the company became a government owned plc last year , " the company said in a statement .
earlier on friday , mr leighton said in an interview with the times newspaper that the new name had become tainted by bad publicity surrounding consignia 's recent poor performance .
" would i like to change the name ?
yes i would , " he said .
however , he added that the cost of reversing the name change can not be justified at a time when the loss-making company is planning to lay off thousands of workers as part of a massive restructuring exercise .
any move to revert to the post office name would also be likely to run into opposition from consignia chief executive john roberts .
brand building the post office changed its name to consignia last year in a £ 1m rebranding exercise designed to mark the organisation 's transformation from a public service provider to a state-owned limited company .
the new name was intended to reflect the organisation 's more commercial approach .
at the time , mr roberts said the new name would be seen " principally by our corporate customers in the financial services , telecommunications , home shopping , utilities and advertising and marketing sectors " .
bad to worse however , consignia has performed poorly since adopting its new name .
dogged by industrial disputes and increasing competition in its key markets , the company reported a record £ 281m loss for the six months to november 2001 .
consignia is facing the threat of strike action in a dispute with the communication workers ' union over pay .
mr leighton on friday agreed that consignia is in trouble .
" this business is in freefall .
our profitability is heading south and our cash is heading south at a faster rate .
it is bad and it is getting worse , " he told the times .
government plans for a three-stage liberalisation of the uk postal services market , due to begin in april , have put consignia under further pressure to restructure .

speaking before a congressional committee , ms watkins said that she discovered a $ 700m -lrb- £ 489m -rrb- hole in enron 's finances last summer and urged former chief executive kenneth lay to find out who was responsible .
it is my humble opinion that mr lay did not understand the gravity of the situation sherron watkins but she maintained that mr lay , who holds an economics doctorate , did not understand the gravity of the situation , and that he was duped by his senior management andrew fastow and jeffrey skilling .
ms watkins ' testimony jars significantly with what has already been heard during two intense weeks of congressional hearings .
congressmen praised ms watkins for her courage her defence of mr lay contrasts with the blistering criticism he received from law makers .

mr skilling claimed not to know the details of enron 's problematic partnerships when he testified before the same committee last week .
bruce hiler , mr skilling 's attorney , said ms watkins ' testimony was not based on fact .
ms watkins testimony contradicts that of mr skilling " everything ms watkins said about my client is based on hearsay , rumour or her opinion , " he said .

assigning blame ms watkins also placed blame on enron 's auditor , andersen - for signing off accounts - and on vinson & elkins , a law firm representing enron .
" while she is clearly well intentioned , ms watkins is not in a positions to form judgements about andersen , " said a spokesman for the auditor , adding that she had not attended key meetings when andersen discussed the partnerships with enron executives .
ms watkins was highly critical of mr fastow her testimony left sacked chief financial officer andrew fastow in a bad light , when she revealed that he had tried to sack her and seize her computer when she sounding the warning bell .
both mr fastow and mr lay invoked their right to remain silent before the congressional committees in order to avoid incriminating themselves .
she also laid blame at the door of chief accounting officer richard causey and chief risk officer richard buy - both of whom were sacked by enron 's acting chief stephen cooper shortly before the hearing began .

mr lay was advised to come clean investigators questioned her closely to discover how , when and why her warnings were ignored by enron 's management .

defence barrister courtenay griffiths qc levelled the accusation at sergeant carolyn crooks during cross examination at the old bailey .
sergeant crooks conducted hours of interviews with the key prosecution witness - a 14-year-old girl - who is described as the only person to see the events leading to 10-year-old damilola 's death .
mr griffiths said pressure to solve the alleged murder had led to sergeant crooks being sent in .
he said the metropolitan police was conscious of the fallout from the stephen lawrence case .
but giving evidence on thursday , sergeant crooks rejected allegations that she had given the witness crucial information .
damilola died on november 27 , 2000 , from a thigh injury caused by a broken beer bottle on the north peckham estate , south london , where he lived .
two brothers aged 16 , their 17-year-old friend and a 14-year-old youth deny murder , manslaughter and assault with intent to rob .
' disturbed young girl ' cross-examining sergeant crooks , mr griffiths said : " by january 2001 , you officers were desperate and i suggest you were sent in to manufacture the eyewitness .
" i am going to suggest that you quite simply took advantage of a disturbed and damaged young girl and turned her into an eyewitness . "
sergeant crooks denied suggestions she was negligent in not checking the girl 's background more closely . "
from the day she phoned 999 , and named the boys and named the weapon , she has not switched from that " sergeant carolyn crooks she said she had not known the girl 's mother had convictions for selling drugs but added it would not have made any difference to her evidence as an eyewitness .
but mr griffiths told sergeant crooks the girl 's background meant she could be motivated by money .
asked if she got the impression that the girl was taking the police " for a ride " , sergeant crooks said : " no . "
she said officers " were very grateful " when the girl came forward .
alarm bells sergeant crooks denied knowing that the teenager had been described as " an attention-seeker and liar " by her school .
mr griffiths said the girl , in a police video , had said : " is that where damilola was stabbed ? " when shown a map .
he asked sergeant crooks : " did n't your ears pick up ?
did n't alarm bells start ringing ? "
sergeant crooks said the girl needed assistance reading the map and if her hands were pointing to any particular area , it was not intentional .
she denied mr griffiths ' suggestions that she was providing the girl with assistance and crucial information .
" if my fingers went to where damilola was stabbed , it was not intentional or meant to be a prompt , " she said .
holiday request and sgt crooks denied using the girl 's friendship with the 14-year-old defendant as a " carrot " by saying he would be " sorted " .
she had passed the girl 's request for a holiday in spain to a senior officer but nothing had come of it .
" it was all quite flippant .
i think we knew it was never going to happen , " she said .
sergeant crooks denied using the £ 50,000 reward get the girl to admit being at the scene .
when she said the girl was more " guaranteed " to get the money if she had witnessed the crime , she meant if , as she suspected , she was telling the truth .
baroness mallalieu , defending the second 16-year-old , accused the officer of breaking home office guidelines on interviewing children .
changing story lady mallalieu asserted the girl appeared to have been told she would have to keep coming back unless she said she was at the murder scene .
but the officer maintained the girl was interviewed so many times because she kept changing her story .
" from the day she phoned 999 , and named the boys and named the weapon , she has not switched from that . "
the only thing which had not been consistent was where she had got the information from , the officer said .
the hearing was adjourned until friday .
