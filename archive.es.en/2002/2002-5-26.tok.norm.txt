as in berlin , thousands of protesters were ready to greet him in paris . only a few hours before the arrival of the american presidential delegation in paris , french protesters were gearing up for large-scale demonstrations .
as in berlin earlier in the week , thousands of vocal demonstrators were ready to take to the streets to show their disapproval of american militarism and unilateralism in handling current world issues .
thirty french organizations including the green party , partners in france ’ s previous leftist government , joined forces for the protests .
together , the groups organized two high-profile demonstrations on issues ranging from a possible us attack on iraq to washington ’ s policies on the middle east , trade and the environment .
but the protesters were clear to draw the line between anti-american protests and criticism of the current american administration .
" it ’ s not an anti-american demonstration , " said pierre tartakowsky , secretary general of attac , france ’ s most high-profile anti-globalization group which is helping to organize the protests .
" it ’ s against policies led by bush and his administration .
the present us administration is very aggressive and very dangerous for the future of the planet " , he told reporters prior to bush 's visit .
attac , like the other protest groups , accuses bush of war-mongering and says his administration is using its war on terror to promote us imperialism in regions where it normally would not have a foot-hold .
" we are worried he is preparing an attack on iraq , " tartakowsky said .
the protesters said they will focus on us militarism during a demonstration at caen in normady on monday , where president bush is expected to visit an american cemetery in honor of us soldiers who died in world war ii .
the protest organizers had hoped thousands of people would turn out for demonstrations to show their opposition to the current american president and his policies .
so far , on the first day , only about 5,000 people participated in the paris protests - a relatively low number for the capital city .

as in berlin , thousands of protesters were ready to greet him in paris . only a few hours before the arrival of the american presidential delegation in paris , french protesters were gearing up for large-scale demonstrations .
as in berlin earlier in the week , thousands of vocal demonstrators were ready to take to the streets to show their disapproval of american militarism and unilateralism in handling current world issues .
thirty french organizations including the green party , partners in france ’ s previous leftist government , joined forces for the protests .
together , the groups organized two high-profile demonstrations on issues ranging from a possible us attack on iraq to washington ’ s policies on the middle east , trade and the environment .
but the protesters were clear to draw the line between anti-american protests and criticism of the current american administration .

" it ’ s against policies led by bush and his administration .
the present us administration is very aggressive and very dangerous for the future of the planet " , he told reporters prior to bush 's visit .
attac , like the other protest groups , accuses bush of war-mongering and says his administration is using its war on terror to promote us imperialism in regions where it normally would not have a foot-hold .
" we are worried he is preparing an attack on iraq , " tartakowsky said .
the protesters said they will focus on us militarism during a demonstration at caen in normady on monday , where president bush is expected to visit an american cemetery in honor of us soldiers who died in world war ii .
the protest organizers had hoped thousands of people would turn out for demonstrations to show their opposition to the current american president and his policies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.05.2002 israel critic withdraws application to join german party großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a defiant jürgen möllemann announces the departure of the arab-german he championed .
the free democratic party says syrian-born jamal karsli , an outspoken israel critic , has withdrawn his application to join the party .
but a key state party leader remains in the hot seat . officials with the free-market free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- on wednesday announced a face-saving solution to the controversy over admitting a new member who has been a lightning-rod of criticism because of his outspoken statements against israel .
fdp chairman guido westerwelle announced wednesday that jamal karsli had withdrawn his application to join the party .
mr. karsli , a syrian-born politician and naturalized german citizen , is a former green and member of the north rhine-westphalia state parliament .
he recently bolted from his party because he did n't support its pro-israel policies and sought to become a member of the fdp .
" a political witch hunt " jürgen möllemann , the fdp 's chairman in the state of north rhine-westphalia , set out the compromise that may have settled the row .
mr. karsli will now be allowed to sit with the fdp group in state parliament , but he will have no official party affiliation .
at his own press conference wednesday , möllemann accused the german " political classes " of having conducted a " public witch hunt " against karsli .
karsli drew widespread criticism for a published article in which he compared the methods used by the israeli government during its occupation of palestinian-controlled areas to those of the nazis .
in another interview , he lambasted the media-influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany .
mr. möllemann , his chief supporter and the head of the german-arab society , has stood steadfastly behind karsli from the beginning of the controversy .
his own political future fell into question last week , after he accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . " trouble at the polls ?
the comments sparked outrage over möllemann within the free democrats and without , and led many to worry that the scandal would vaporize the party 's chances of securing key ministerial posts - including the foreign ministry - if it becomes part of a coalition government after the september 22 national elections .
international attention to the row has been particularly embarrassing for party chief westerwelle , who is planning a trip to israel next week .
on wednesday , westerwelle , who has sought to distance himself from möllemann 's statements , took his own shots at friedman , saying the jewish leader had " no higher moral authority to accuse the fdp of anti-semitism or to go after people who think differently with the ' nazi card . " '
" can the israeli government be criticized ? "
westerwelle asked .
" yes , of course it can be criticized .
may the critic be labelled an anti-semite ?
i think not . "
fdp member arrested in israel in an apparently unrelated incident , the german foreign ministry revealed on wednesday that police in jerusalem had searched the home of the head of the local office of the fdp-aligned friedrich naumann institute and briefly taken him into custody .
the israelis , the official said , believed he had acted " against the interests of israel . "
police alleged that burkhard blanke possessed maps of army checkpoints that could be used in attacks against israeli interests .
however , following the intervention of tuesday of german foreign minister joschka fischer , israeli foreign minister shimon peres said no further action would be taken against blanke .
foreign ministry spokesman andreas michaelis told reporters the government did not see any link between the scandal over anti-israeli statements made by fdp members in germany and the incident .
" that is just wild speculation , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-israel remarks plague german party jewish leaders in germany are waging a war of words against the free democrats over anti-israel remarks made by a syrian-born party member .

the free democratic party says syrian-born jamal karsli , an outspoken israel critic , has withdrawn his application to join the party .
but a key state party leader remains in the hot seat . officials with the free-market free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- on wednesday announced a face-saving solution to the controversy over admitting a new member who has been a lightning-rod of criticism because of his outspoken statements against israel .
fdp chairman guido westerwelle announced wednesday that jamal karsli had withdrawn his application to join the party .
mr. karsli , a syrian-born politician and naturalized german citizen , is a former green and member of the north rhine-westphalia state parliament .
he recently bolted from his party because he did n't support its pro-israel policies and sought to become a member of the fdp .
" a political witch hunt " jürgen möllemann , the fdp 's chairman in the state of north rhine-westphalia , set out the compromise that may have settled the row .
mr. karsli will now be allowed to sit with the fdp group in state parliament , but he will have no official party affiliation .
at his own press conference wednesday , möllemann accused the german " political classes " of having conducted a " public witch hunt " against karsli .
karsli drew widespread criticism for a published article in which he compared the methods used by the israeli government during its occupation of palestinian-controlled areas to those of the nazis .
in another interview , he lambasted the media-influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany .
mr. möllemann , his chief supporter and the head of the german-arab society , has stood steadfastly behind karsli from the beginning of the controversy .
his own political future fell into question last week , after he accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . " trouble at the polls ?
the comments sparked outrage over möllemann within the free democrats and without , and led many to worry that the scandal would vaporize the party 's chances of securing key ministerial posts - including the foreign ministry - if it becomes part of a coalition government after the september 22 national elections .
international attention to the row has been particularly embarrassing for party chief westerwelle , who is planning a trip to israel next week .
on wednesday , westerwelle , who has sought to distance himself from möllemann 's statements , took his own shots at friedman , saying the jewish leader had " no higher moral authority to accuse the fdp of anti-semitism or to go after people who think differently with the ' nazi card . " '
" can the israeli government be criticized ? "
westerwelle asked .
" yes , of course it can be criticized .
may the critic be labelled an anti-semite ?
i think not . "
fdp member arrested in israel in an apparently unrelated incident , the german foreign ministry revealed on wednesday that police in jerusalem had searched the home of the head of the local office of the fdp-aligned friedrich naumann institute and briefly taken him into custody .
the israelis , the official said , believed he had acted " against the interests of israel . "
police alleged that burkhard blanke possessed maps of army checkpoints that could be used in attacks against israeli interests .
however , following the intervention of tuesday of german foreign minister joschka fischer , israeli foreign minister shimon peres said no further action would be taken against blanke .
foreign ministry spokesman andreas michaelis told reporters the government did not see any link between the scandal over anti-israeli statements made by fdp members in germany and the incident .
" that is just wild speculation , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-israel remarks plague german party jewish leaders in germany are waging a war of words against the free democrats over anti-israel remarks made by a syrian-born party member .
now , fdp leaders are isolating the two politicians at the scandal 's epicenter .

" a political witch hunt " jürgen möllemann , the fdp 's chairman in the state of north rhine-westphalia , set out the compromise that may have settled the row .
mr. karsli will now be allowed to sit with the fdp group in state parliament , but he will have no official party affiliation .
at his own press conference wednesday , möllemann accused the german " political classes " of having conducted a " public witch hunt " against karsli .
karsli drew widespread criticism for a published article in which he compared the methods used by the israeli government during its occupation of palestinian-controlled areas to those of the nazis .
in another interview , he lambasted the media-influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany .
mr. möllemann , his chief supporter and the head of the german-arab society , has stood steadfastly behind karsli from the beginning of the controversy .
his own political future fell into question last week , after he accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . " trouble at the polls ?
the comments sparked outrage over möllemann within the free democrats and without , and led many to worry that the scandal would vaporize the party 's chances of securing key ministerial posts - including the foreign ministry - if it becomes part of a coalition government after the september 22 national elections .
international attention to the row has been particularly embarrassing for party chief westerwelle , who is planning a trip to israel next week .
on wednesday , westerwelle , who has sought to distance himself from möllemann 's statements , took his own shots at friedman , saying the jewish leader had " no higher moral authority to accuse the fdp of anti-semitism or to go after people who think differently with the ' nazi card . " '
" can the israeli government be criticized ? "
westerwelle asked .
" yes , of course it can be criticized .
may the critic be labelled an anti-semite ?
i think not . "
fdp member arrested in israel in an apparently unrelated incident , the german foreign ministry revealed on wednesday that police in jerusalem had searched the home of the head of the local office of the fdp-aligned friedrich naumann institute and briefly taken him into custody .
the israelis , the official said , believed he had acted " against the interests of israel . "
police alleged that burkhard blanke possessed maps of army checkpoints that could be used in attacks against israeli interests .
however , following the intervention of tuesday of german foreign minister joschka fischer , israeli foreign minister shimon peres said no further action would be taken against blanke .
foreign ministry spokesman andreas michaelis told reporters the government did not see any link between the scandal over anti-israeli statements made by fdp members in germany and the incident .
" that is just wild speculation , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-israel remarks plague german party jewish leaders in germany are waging a war of words against the free democrats over anti-israel remarks made by a syrian-born party member .
now , fdp leaders are isolating the two politicians at the scandal 's epicenter .

as in berlin , thousands of protesters were ready to greet him in paris . only a few hours before the arrival of the american presidential delegation in paris , french protesters were gearing up for large-scale demonstrations .
as in berlin earlier in the week , thousands of vocal demonstrators were ready to take to the streets to show their disapproval of american militarism and unilateralism in handling current world issues .
thirty french organizations including the green party , partners in france ’ s previous leftist government , joined forces for the protests .
together , the groups organized two high-profile demonstrations on issues ranging from a possible us attack on iraq to washington ’ s policies on the middle east , trade and the environment .
but the protesters were clear to draw the line between anti-american protests and criticism of the current american administration .
" it ’ s not an anti-american demonstration , " said pierre tartakowsky , secretary general of attac , france ’ s most high-profile anti-globalization group which is helping to organize the protests .
" it ’ s against policies led by bush and his administration .
the present us administration is very aggressive and very dangerous for the future of the planet " , he told reporters prior to bush 's visit .
attac , like the other protest groups , accuses bush of war-mongering and says his administration is using its war on terror to promote us imperialism in regions where it normally would not have a foot-hold .
" we are worried he is preparing an attack on iraq , " tartakowsky said .
the protesters said they will focus on us militarism during a demonstration at caen in normady on monday , where president bush is expected to visit an american cemetery in honor of us soldiers who died in world war ii .
the protest organizers had hoped thousands of people would turn out for demonstrations to show their opposition to the current american president and his policies .
so far , on the first day , only about 5,000 people participated in the paris protests - a relatively low number for the capital city .

as in berlin , thousands of protesters were ready to greet him in paris . only a few hours before the arrival of the american presidential delegation in paris , french protesters were gearing up for large-scale demonstrations .
as in berlin earlier in the week , thousands of vocal demonstrators were ready to take to the streets to show their disapproval of american militarism and unilateralism in handling current world issues .
thirty french organizations including the green party , partners in france ’ s previous leftist government , joined forces for the protests .
together , the groups organized two high-profile demonstrations on issues ranging from a possible us attack on iraq to washington ’ s policies on the middle east , trade and the environment .
but the protesters were clear to draw the line between anti-american protests and criticism of the current american administration .
" it ’ s not an anti-american demonstration , " said pierre tartakowsky , secretary general of attac , france ’ s most high-profile anti-globalization group which is helping to organize the protests .
" it ’ s against policies led by bush and his administration .
the present us administration is very aggressive and very dangerous for the future of the planet " , he told reporters prior to bush 's visit .
attac , like the other protest groups , accuses bush of war-mongering and says his administration is using its war on terror to promote us imperialism in regions where it normally would not have a foot-hold .
" we are worried he is preparing an attack on iraq , " tartakowsky said .
the protesters said they will focus on us militarism during a demonstration at caen in normady on monday , where president bush is expected to visit an american cemetery in honor of us soldiers who died in world war ii .

the free democratic party says syrian-born jamal karsli , an outspoken israel critic , has withdrawn his application to join the party .
but a key state party leader remains in the hot seat . officials with the free-market free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- on wednesday announced a face-saving solution to the controversy over admitting a new member who has been a lightning-rod of criticism because of his outspoken statements against israel .
fdp chairman guido westerwelle announced wednesday that jamal karsli had withdrawn his application to join the party .
mr. karsli , a syrian-born politician and naturalized german citizen , is a former green and member of the north rhine-westphalia state parliament .
he recently bolted from his party because he did n't support its pro-israel policies and sought to become a member of the fdp .
" a political witch hunt " jürgen möllemann , the fdp 's chairman in the state of north rhine-westphalia , set out the compromise that may have settled the row .
mr. karsli will now be allowed to sit with the fdp group in state parliament , but he will have no official party affiliation .
at his own press conference wednesday , möllemann accused the german " political classes " of having conducted a " public witch hunt " against karsli .
karsli drew widespread criticism for a published article in which he compared the methods used by the israeli government during its occupation of palestinian-controlled areas to those of the nazis .
in another interview , he lambasted the media-influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany .
mr. möllemann , his chief supporter and the head of the german-arab society , has stood steadfastly behind karsli from the beginning of the controversy .
his own political future fell into question last week , after he accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . " trouble at the polls ?
the comments sparked outrage over möllemann within the free democrats and without , and led many to worry that the scandal would vaporize the party 's chances of securing key ministerial posts - including the foreign ministry - if it becomes part of a coalition government after the september 22 national elections .
international attention to the row has been particularly embarrassing for party chief westerwelle , who is planning a trip to israel next week .
on wednesday , westerwelle , who has sought to distance himself from möllemann 's statements , took his own shots at friedman , saying the jewish leader had " no higher moral authority to accuse the fdp of anti-semitism or to go after people who think differently with the ' nazi card . " '
" can the israeli government be criticized ? "
westerwelle asked .
" yes , of course it can be criticized .
may the critic be labelled an anti-semite ?
i think not . "
fdp member arrested in israel in an apparently unrelated incident , the german foreign ministry revealed on wednesday that police in jerusalem had searched the home of the head of the local office of the fdp-aligned friedrich naumann institute and briefly taken him into custody .
the israelis , the official said , believed he had acted " against the interests of israel . "
police alleged that burkhard blanke possessed maps of army checkpoints that could be used in attacks against israeli interests .
however , following the intervention of tuesday of german foreign minister joschka fischer , israeli foreign minister shimon peres said no further action would be taken against blanke .
foreign ministry spokesman andreas michaelis told reporters the government did not see any link between the scandal over anti-israeli statements made by fdp members in germany and the incident .

the comments sparked outrage over möllemann within the free democrats and without , and led many to worry that the scandal would vaporize the party 's chances of securing key ministerial posts - including the foreign ministry - if it becomes part of a coalition government after the september 22 national elections .
international attention to the row has been particularly embarrassing for party chief westerwelle , who is planning a trip to israel next week .
on wednesday , westerwelle , who has sought to distance himself from möllemann 's statements , took his own shots at friedman , saying the jewish leader had " no higher moral authority to accuse the fdp of anti-semitism or to go after people who think differently with the ' nazi card . " '
" can the israeli government be criticized ? "
westerwelle asked .
" yes , of course it can be criticized .
may the critic be labelled an anti-semite ?
i think not . "
fdp member arrested in israel in an apparently unrelated incident , the german foreign ministry revealed on wednesday that police in jerusalem had searched the home of the head of the local office of the fdp-aligned friedrich naumann institute and briefly taken him into custody .
the israelis , the official said , believed he had acted " against the interests of israel . "
police alleged that burkhard blanke possessed maps of army checkpoints that could be used in attacks against israeli interests .
however , following the intervention of tuesday of german foreign minister joschka fischer , israeli foreign minister shimon peres said no further action would be taken against blanke .

the free democratic party says syrian-born jamal karsli , an outspoken israel critic , has withdrawn his application to join the party .
but a key state party leader remains in the hot seat . officials with the free-market free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- on wednesday announced a face-saving solution to the controversy over admitting a new member who has been a lightning-rod of criticism because of his outspoken statements against israel .
fdp chairman guido westerwelle announced wednesday that jamal karsli had withdrawn his application to join the party .
mr. karsli , a syrian-born politician and naturalized german citizen , is a former green and member of the north rhine-westphalia state parliament .
he recently bolted from his party because he did n't support its pro-israel policies and sought to become a member of the fdp .
" a political witch hunt " jürgen möllemann , the fdp 's chairman in the state of north rhine-westphalia , set out the compromise that may have settled the row .
mr. karsli will now be allowed to sit with the fdp group in state parliament , but he will have no official party affiliation .
at his own press conference wednesday , möllemann accused the german " political classes " of having conducted a " public witch hunt " against karsli .
karsli drew widespread criticism for a published article in which he compared the methods used by the israeli government during its occupation of palestinian-controlled areas to those of the nazis .
in another interview , he lambasted the media-influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany .
mr. möllemann , his chief supporter and the head of the german-arab society , has stood steadfastly behind karsli from the beginning of the controversy .
his own political future fell into question last week , after he accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . " trouble at the polls ?

as in berlin , thousands of protesters were ready to greet him in paris . only a few hours before the arrival of the american presidential delegation in paris , french protesters were gearing up for large-scale demonstrations .
as in berlin earlier in the week , thousands of vocal demonstrators were ready to take to the streets to show their disapproval of american militarism and unilateralism in handling current world issues .
thirty french organizations including the green party , partners in france ’ s previous leftist government , joined forces for the protests .
together , the groups organized two high-profile demonstrations on issues ranging from a possible us attack on iraq to washington ’ s policies on the middle east , trade and the environment .
but the protesters were clear to draw the line between anti-american protests and criticism of the current american administration .
" it ’ s not an anti-american demonstration , " said pierre tartakowsky , secretary general of attac , france ’ s most high-profile anti-globalization group which is helping to organize the protests .
" it ’ s against policies led by bush and his administration .
the present us administration is very aggressive and very dangerous for the future of the planet " , he told reporters prior to bush 's visit .
attac , like the other protest groups , accuses bush of war-mongering and says his administration is using its war on terror to promote us imperialism in regions where it normally would not have a foot-hold .
" we are worried he is preparing an attack on iraq , " tartakowsky said .
the protesters said they will focus on us militarism during a demonstration at caen in normady on monday , where president bush is expected to visit an american cemetery in honor of us soldiers who died in world war ii .
the protest organizers had hoped thousands of people would turn out for demonstrations to show their opposition to the current american president and his policies .
so far , on the first day , only about 5,000 people participated in the paris protests - a relatively low number for the capital city .

but the protesters were clear to draw the line between anti-american protests and criticism of the current american administration .
" it ’ s not an anti-american demonstration , " said pierre tartakowsky , secretary general of attac , france ’ s most high-profile anti-globalization group which is helping to organize the protests .
" it ’ s against policies led by bush and his administration .
the present us administration is very aggressive and very dangerous for the future of the planet " , he told reporters prior to bush 's visit .
attac , like the other protest groups , accuses bush of war-mongering and says his administration is using its war on terror to promote us imperialism in regions where it normally would not have a foot-hold .
" we are worried he is preparing an attack on iraq , " tartakowsky said .
the protesters said they will focus on us militarism during a demonstration at caen in normady on monday , where president bush is expected to visit an american cemetery in honor of us soldiers who died in world war ii .
the protest organizers had hoped thousands of people would turn out for demonstrations to show their opposition to the current american president and his policies .
so far , on the first day , only about 5,000 people participated in the paris protests - a relatively low number for the capital city .

the free democratic party says syrian-born jamal karsli , an outspoken israel critic , has withdrawn his application to join the party .
but a key state party leader remains in the hot seat . officials with the free-market free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- on wednesday announced a face-saving solution to the controversy over admitting a new member who has been a lightning-rod of criticism because of his outspoken statements against israel .
fdp chairman guido westerwelle announced wednesday that jamal karsli had withdrawn his application to join the party .
mr. karsli , a syrian-born politician and naturalized german citizen , is a former green and member of the north rhine-westphalia state parliament .
he recently bolted from his party because he did n't support its pro-israel policies and sought to become a member of the fdp .
" a political witch hunt " jürgen möllemann , the fdp 's chairman in the state of north rhine-westphalia , set out the compromise that may have settled the row .
mr. karsli will now be allowed to sit with the fdp group in state parliament , but he will have no official party affiliation .
at his own press conference wednesday , möllemann accused the german " political classes " of having conducted a " public witch hunt " against karsli .
karsli drew widespread criticism for a published article in which he compared the methods used by the israeli government during its occupation of palestinian-controlled areas to those of the nazis .
in another interview , he lambasted the media-influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany .
mr. möllemann , his chief supporter and the head of the german-arab society , has stood steadfastly behind karsli from the beginning of the controversy .
his own political future fell into question last week , after he accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . " trouble at the polls ?
the comments sparked outrage over möllemann within the free democrats and without , and led many to worry that the scandal would vaporize the party 's chances of securing key ministerial posts - including the foreign ministry - if it becomes part of a coalition government after the september 22 national elections .
international attention to the row has been particularly embarrassing for party chief westerwelle , who is planning a trip to israel next week .
on wednesday , westerwelle , who has sought to distance himself from möllemann 's statements , took his own shots at friedman , saying the jewish leader had " no higher moral authority to accuse the fdp of anti-semitism or to go after people who think differently with the ' nazi card . " '
" can the israeli government be criticized ? "
westerwelle asked .
" yes , of course it can be criticized .
may the critic be labelled an anti-semite ?
i think not . "
fdp member arrested in israel in an apparently unrelated incident , the german foreign ministry revealed on wednesday that police in jerusalem had searched the home of the head of the local office of the fdp-aligned friedrich naumann institute and briefly taken him into custody .
the israelis , the official said , believed he had acted " against the interests of israel . "
police alleged that burkhard blanke possessed maps of army checkpoints that could be used in attacks against israeli interests .
however , following the intervention of tuesday of german foreign minister joschka fischer , israeli foreign minister shimon peres said no further action would be taken against blanke .
foreign ministry spokesman andreas michaelis told reporters the government did not see any link between the scandal over anti-israeli statements made by fdp members in germany and the incident .

" a political witch hunt " jürgen möllemann , the fdp 's chairman in the state of north rhine-westphalia , set out the compromise that may have settled the row .
mr. karsli will now be allowed to sit with the fdp group in state parliament , but he will have no official party affiliation .
at his own press conference wednesday , möllemann accused the german " political classes " of having conducted a " public witch hunt " against karsli .
karsli drew widespread criticism for a published article in which he compared the methods used by the israeli government during its occupation of palestinian-controlled areas to those of the nazis .
in another interview , he lambasted the media-influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany .
mr. möllemann , his chief supporter and the head of the german-arab society , has stood steadfastly behind karsli from the beginning of the controversy .
his own political future fell into question last week , after he accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . " trouble at the polls ?
the comments sparked outrage over möllemann within the free democrats and without , and led many to worry that the scandal would vaporize the party 's chances of securing key ministerial posts - including the foreign ministry - if it becomes part of a coalition government after the september 22 national elections .
international attention to the row has been particularly embarrassing for party chief westerwelle , who is planning a trip to israel next week .
on wednesday , westerwelle , who has sought to distance himself from möllemann 's statements , took his own shots at friedman , saying the jewish leader had " no higher moral authority to accuse the fdp of anti-semitism or to go after people who think differently with the ' nazi card . " '
" can the israeli government be criticized ? "
westerwelle asked .
" yes , of course it can be criticized .
may the critic be labelled an anti-semite ?
i think not . "
fdp member arrested in israel in an apparently unrelated incident , the german foreign ministry revealed on wednesday that police in jerusalem had searched the home of the head of the local office of the fdp-aligned friedrich naumann institute and briefly taken him into custody .
the israelis , the official said , believed he had acted " against the interests of israel . "
police alleged that burkhard blanke possessed maps of army checkpoints that could be used in attacks against israeli interests .
however , following the intervention of tuesday of german foreign minister joschka fischer , israeli foreign minister shimon peres said no further action would be taken against blanke .
foreign ministry spokesman andreas michaelis told reporters the government did not see any link between the scandal over anti-israeli statements made by fdp members in germany and the incident .

the free democratic party says syrian-born jamal karsli , an outspoken israel critic , has withdrawn his application to join the party .
but a key state party leader remains in the hot seat . officials with the free-market free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- on wednesday announced a face-saving solution to the controversy over admitting a new member who has been a lightning-rod of criticism because of his outspoken statements against israel .
fdp chairman guido westerwelle announced wednesday that jamal karsli had withdrawn his application to join the party .
mr. karsli , a syrian-born politician and naturalized german citizen , is a former green and member of the north rhine-westphalia state parliament .
he recently bolted from his party because he did n't support its pro-israel policies and sought to become a member of the fdp .
" a political witch hunt " jürgen möllemann , the fdp 's chairman in the state of north rhine-westphalia , set out the compromise that may have settled the row .
mr. karsli will now be allowed to sit with the fdp group in state parliament , but he will have no official party affiliation .
at his own press conference wednesday , möllemann accused the german " political classes " of having conducted a " public witch hunt " against karsli .
karsli drew widespread criticism for a published article in which he compared the methods used by the israeli government during its occupation of palestinian-controlled areas to those of the nazis .
in another interview , he lambasted the media-influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany .
mr. möllemann , his chief supporter and the head of the german-arab society , has stood steadfastly behind karsli from the beginning of the controversy .
his own political future fell into question last week , after he accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . " trouble at the polls ?
the comments sparked outrage over möllemann within the free democrats and without , and led many to worry that the scandal would vaporize the party 's chances of securing key ministerial posts - including the foreign ministry - if it becomes part of a coalition government after the september 22 national elections .
international attention to the row has been particularly embarrassing for party chief westerwelle , who is planning a trip to israel next week .
on wednesday , westerwelle , who has sought to distance himself from möllemann 's statements , took his own shots at friedman , saying the jewish leader had " no higher moral authority to accuse the fdp of anti-semitism or to go after people who think differently with the ' nazi card . " '

the free democratic party says syrian-born jamal karsli , an outspoken israel critic , has withdrawn his application to join the party .
but a key state party leader remains in the hot seat . officials with the free-market free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- on wednesday announced a face-saving solution to the controversy over admitting a new member who has been a lightning-rod of criticism because of his outspoken statements against israel .
fdp chairman guido westerwelle announced wednesday that jamal karsli had withdrawn his application to join the party .
mr. karsli , a syrian-born politician and naturalized german citizen , is a former green and member of the north rhine-westphalia state parliament .
he recently bolted from his party because he did n't support its pro-israel policies and sought to become a member of the fdp .
" a political witch hunt " jürgen möllemann , the fdp 's chairman in the state of north rhine-westphalia , set out the compromise that may have settled the row .
mr. karsli will now be allowed to sit with the fdp group in state parliament , but he will have no official party affiliation .
at his own press conference wednesday , möllemann accused the german " political classes " of having conducted a " public witch hunt " against karsli .
karsli drew widespread criticism for a published article in which he compared the methods used by the israeli government during its occupation of palestinian-controlled areas to those of the nazis .
in another interview , he lambasted the media-influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany .
mr. möllemann , his chief supporter and the head of the german-arab society , has stood steadfastly behind karsli from the beginning of the controversy .
his own political future fell into question last week , after he accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . " trouble at the polls ?
the comments sparked outrage over möllemann within the free democrats and without , and led many to worry that the scandal would vaporize the party 's chances of securing key ministerial posts - including the foreign ministry - if it becomes part of a coalition government after the september 22 national elections .
international attention to the row has been particularly embarrassing for party chief westerwelle , who is planning a trip to israel next week .
on wednesday , westerwelle , who has sought to distance himself from möllemann 's statements , took his own shots at friedman , saying the jewish leader had " no higher moral authority to accuse the fdp of anti-semitism or to go after people who think differently with the ' nazi card . " '
" can the israeli government be criticized ? "
westerwelle asked .
" yes , of course it can be criticized .
may the critic be labelled an anti-semite ?
i think not . "
fdp member arrested in israel in an apparently unrelated incident , the german foreign ministry revealed on wednesday that police in jerusalem had searched the home of the head of the local office of the fdp-aligned friedrich naumann institute and briefly taken him into custody .
the israelis , the official said , believed he had acted " against the interests of israel . "
police alleged that burkhard blanke possessed maps of army checkpoints that could be used in attacks against israeli interests .
however , following the intervention of tuesday of german foreign minister joschka fischer , israeli foreign minister shimon peres said no further action would be taken against blanke .
foreign ministry spokesman andreas michaelis told reporters the government did not see any link between the scandal over anti-israeli statements made by fdp members in germany and the incident .
" that is just wild speculation , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de anti-israel remarks plague german party jewish leaders in germany are waging a war of words against the free democrats over anti-israel remarks made by a syrian-born party member .

" a political witch hunt " jürgen möllemann , the fdp 's chairman in the state of north rhine-westphalia , set out the compromise that may have settled the row .
mr. karsli will now be allowed to sit with the fdp group in state parliament , but he will have no official party affiliation .
at his own press conference wednesday , möllemann accused the german " political classes " of having conducted a " public witch hunt " against karsli .
karsli drew widespread criticism for a published article in which he compared the methods used by the israeli government during its occupation of palestinian-controlled areas to those of the nazis .
in another interview , he lambasted the media-influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany .
mr. möllemann , his chief supporter and the head of the german-arab society , has stood steadfastly behind karsli from the beginning of the controversy .
his own political future fell into question last week , after he accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . " trouble at the polls ?
the comments sparked outrage over möllemann within the free democrats and without , and led many to worry that the scandal would vaporize the party 's chances of securing key ministerial posts - including the foreign ministry - if it becomes part of a coalition government after the september 22 national elections .
international attention to the row has been particularly embarrassing for party chief westerwelle , who is planning a trip to israel next week .
on wednesday , westerwelle , who has sought to distance himself from möllemann 's statements , took his own shots at friedman , saying the jewish leader had " no higher moral authority to accuse the fdp of anti-semitism or to go after people who think differently with the ' nazi card . " '
" can the israeli government be criticized ? "
westerwelle asked .
" yes , of course it can be criticized .
may the critic be labelled an anti-semite ?
i think not . "
fdp member arrested in israel in an apparently unrelated incident , the german foreign ministry revealed on wednesday that police in jerusalem had searched the home of the head of the local office of the fdp-aligned friedrich naumann institute and briefly taken him into custody .

police alleged that burkhard blanke possessed maps of army checkpoints that could be used in attacks against israeli interests .
however , following the intervention of tuesday of german foreign minister joschka fischer , israeli foreign minister shimon peres said no further action would be taken against blanke .

the free democratic party says syrian-born jamal karsli , an outspoken israel critic , has withdrawn his application to join the party .
but a key state party leader remains in the hot seat . officials with the free-market free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- on wednesday announced a face-saving solution to the controversy over admitting a new member who has been a lightning-rod of criticism because of his outspoken statements against israel .
fdp chairman guido westerwelle announced wednesday that jamal karsli had withdrawn his application to join the party .
mr. karsli , a syrian-born politician and naturalized german citizen , is a former green and member of the north rhine-westphalia state parliament .
he recently bolted from his party because he did n't support its pro-israel policies and sought to become a member of the fdp .
" a political witch hunt " jürgen möllemann , the fdp 's chairman in the state of north rhine-westphalia , set out the compromise that may have settled the row .
mr. karsli will now be allowed to sit with the fdp group in state parliament , but he will have no official party affiliation .
at his own press conference wednesday , möllemann accused the german " political classes " of having conducted a " public witch hunt " against karsli .
karsli drew widespread criticism for a published article in which he compared the methods used by the israeli government during its occupation of palestinian-controlled areas to those of the nazis .
in another interview , he lambasted the media-influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany .
mr. möllemann , his chief supporter and the head of the german-arab society , has stood steadfastly behind karsli from the beginning of the controversy .
his own political future fell into question last week , after he accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . " trouble at the polls ?
the comments sparked outrage over möllemann within the free democrats and without , and led many to worry that the scandal would vaporize the party 's chances of securing key ministerial posts - including the foreign ministry - if it becomes part of a coalition government after the september 22 national elections .
international attention to the row has been particularly embarrassing for party chief westerwelle , who is planning a trip to israel next week .
on wednesday , westerwelle , who has sought to distance himself from möllemann 's statements , took his own shots at friedman , saying the jewish leader had " no higher moral authority to accuse the fdp of anti-semitism or to go after people who think differently with the ' nazi card . " '
" can the israeli government be criticized ? "
westerwelle asked .
" yes , of course it can be criticized .
may the critic be labelled an anti-semite ?
i think not . "

the extended spectrum beta-lactamases -lrb- esbl -rrb- superbug is reported to have claimed the life of one patient at hairmyres in east kilbride , one of scotland 's most modern hospitals .
a study by consultant microbiologist at hairmyres , dr dugald baird , said 41 patients were found with the bacterium - which produce enzymes that break down common antibiotics - between july 2001 and april this year .
lanarkshire acute hospitals nhs trust said esbl was a " contributory " factor in the death of one patient .
hairmyres hospital : opened last year the report , published by the scottish centre for infection and environmental health , claims the esbl bacterium could become the new mrsa -lrb- methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus -rrb- .
mrsa is a new generation of bacterial infection which has been described as a superbug because it is particularly resistant to antibiotics .
last month , cardiac surgery at edinburgh royal infirmary was halted after it emerged that 13 patients had contracted the superbug .
dr baird : " initially a lot of the mrsa bacteria were not thought to be very harmful and it may be that we are seeing a similar sort of thing with esbl producers .
resistant organisms " you have to be concerned when you see bacteria mutate into resistant strains before your eyes . "
he said the esbl infection had definitely " contributed " to the death of an hairmyres patient .
a spokesman for lanarkshire acute hospitals nhs trust said : " the trust welcomes the report by dr baird , which has clearly identified areas for further research that in the long term will bring benefits to patients being treated in hospitals throughout the country .
" the data gathered on esbl isolates in hairmyres hospital , has highlighted the problem faced by hospitals all over the world regarding antibiotic resistant organisms .

the series , which has been a huge success in the usa , was meant to begin on 19 may .
the show 's first episode was eventually shown a week later , a day after the british leg of osbourne 's travelling rock festival , ozzfest , at donington park in leicestershire .
" this show is worth at least a second watch .
the mix of ageing headbanger with doting dad is an interesting update of an old formula , " wrote the bbc 's kevin anderson .
but what do you think ?
is it going to be a hit in the uk too ?
does it show a new side to the rock hard man ?
bbc news online users sent us their views .
having been an ozzy fan for a number of years , i could n't wait to see the osbournes and i 'm glad to say i was n't disappointed .

quality television ! !
jason novak , uk the first episode of the osbournes was fantastic , so funny , down to earth - much better " fly on the wall " tv than big brother !

gemma , uk very entertaining , they are all obviously quite barking which makes for great television .
lucy , london , uk " forget big brother - this was the best reality tv ever " adrian , uk i thought it was funny , but what annoyed me the most is that so many clips have been shown advertising the show it felt like i 'd seen most of it already !
stu reeves , england well worth the wait !
the osbournes are n't exactly what you 'd describe as a model family , but watching their antics was fascinating viewing .
yes , there was swearing , but that 's nothing new .
it only added to the amusement factor .
long may it continue !
nev , england i thought it was brilliant .
i dunno if my parents would let me get away with the language ozzy 's kids used , but then again ozzy is hardly one to talk !
saying that , despite what some people say about him , him and his wife / manager seem like pretty average parents and they seem to be doing a pretty good parenting job .
how the other half live eh ?
i 'm looking forward to the next episode already !

the show 's first episode was eventually shown a week later , a day after the british leg of osbourne 's travelling rock festival , ozzfest , at donington park in leicestershire .
" this show is worth at least a second watch .
the mix of ageing headbanger with doting dad is an interesting update of an old formula , " wrote the bbc 's kevin anderson .

company chairman allan leighton , proposing to lay-off 30,000 postal staff in an effort to regain profitability , has warned that the firm will be unable to guarantee its solvency unless it is , effectively , underwritten by the government , the observer newspaper said .
" we are losing money to such an extent that if we do n't get comfort from the government technically we are trading insolvently , " a source told the newspaper .
insolvency , defined as being unable to pay debts when they fall due , often heralds receivership .
however , the government is believed to be full square behind mr leighton 's plans , which aim to cut costs by £ 1.2bn to achieve profitability by 2005 .
" we have been engaged in discussions about the -lsb- firm 's -rsb- financial structure , " a senior source for the department of trade and industry told the newspaper .
" it 's not going to be a problem . "
consignia was expected last week reveal losses estimated at £ 1-1.3bn for last year , but has postponed the profits announcement until next month .
vehicle plan scrapped government support would allow consignia to raise cash needed for kick-starting plans for raising funds from property assets .
but consignia has scrapped a £ 300m plan to hive-off its vehicle fleet and it operations , the mail on sunday said .
" this policy seems to be about moving bodies off our payroll rather than actually saving money , " a source told the newspaper .
" we are not convinced that it will be of benefit to us . "
the plan , involving 40,000 vehicles and 5,000 staff , had been resisted by union .

europe 's thriving low-cost carrier sector could be set for a new entrant , after german travel giant preussag revealed plans to expand into budget travel .
the firm is considering launching a no-frills airline under the name tui , the firm 's overarching brand , board president michael frenzel told german news magazine focus . "
we are looking very seriously at the question , " mr frenzel said .
" the low-budget airline sector has great potential for the future " .
charles gurassa , a uk board member at the group , which owns tour giant thomson in the uk , said : " we have the means to found a new airline company . "
changing sector the move would add a new name to a sector poised to lose go , the british airways-launched carrier which easyjet has bought from venture capitalists .
go planes are to be repainted in easyjet livery .
and it would give preussag , europe 's largest travel and tourism group , which owns 80 planes , the opportunity to tap into one of the region 's most buoyant travel sectors .
while longhaul carriers found their taking severely dented by a passenger slump following the 11 september attacks on the us , budget airlines found their takings supported by low fares and a resilient shorthaul market .
existing budget carriers , based in the uk and ireland , have long recognised the potential of tapping markets in central europe .
holiday slump tour operators have also seen takings slide , with uk firm mytravel - formerly airtours - stunning markets last week by warning that more than 1 million of its summer package holidays remained unsold , following a collapse in bookings for family breaks in the mediterranean .
preussag has said that thomson has not suffered a similar decline .
" recent announcements from competitors , especially in great britain , do not reflect the situation in the general market nor in our development , " mr frenzel said on friday .

mr wyn was speaking after the european union inquiry team 's fact-finding mission to holland , where officials used vaccinations to protect cattle and sheep from the disease .
the euro mp , who coordinated the inquiry team and also sits on the eu rural development committee , said the " conflicting information " issued by the uk government over vaccinations had not helped the farming industry .
hundreds of thousands of sheep and cattle were culled and burned or buried in an effort to stem the spread of foot-and-mouth in the uk .
in wales , there were 118 confirmed cases , the majority in powys , with tourism and farming businesses losing hundreds of millions of pounds in trade .
mr wyn believes evidence from holland shows the widescale disaster could have been avoided in the early days of the outbreak . "
the dutch decision to use vaccination did not stop them from getting back their fmd free status . "
eurig wyn mep , eu rural development committee the dutch government came under strong pressure from the public to halt a mass cull and officials reacted accordingly with a vaccination programme .
holland 's 12 provincial councils provided better help and assistance to farmers than was the case in wales , explained mr wyn .
" we have met many groups from the netherlands who appealed to us to seriously consider a vaccination policy if ever a similar crisis was to occur in the future , " he said .
" officials at the dutch central institute for animal disease control told us that the relevant vaccines could have been made available within five days of the outbreak .
" this contradicts the information given by the government 's scientific advisor professor roy anderson in a hearing in brussels at the beginning of last week .
he claimed it would take at least 16 days for sufficient vaccination to be available . "
mr wyn added : " the -lrb- vaccination -rrb- argument was , of course , based on keeping an fmd free status , but the dutch decision to use vaccination did not stop them from getting back their fmd free status .
indeed they gained that status back before we did in the uk .
" one has to ask whether our market in reality was more adversely hit by pictures of burning pyres of dead animals being beamed by the media all over the world ? "
' on its knees ' it was estimated earlier this earlier that welsh tourism had lost more than £ 200m of income after visitor restrictions were imposed .
but mr wyn added such a situation could have been avoided : " i was informed here in the netherlands that the tourist industry was saved through its policy of vaccination .
" vaccination allowed tourists and visitors to move freely around the country when our own welsh tourist industry was on its knees . "
the powys-based uk rural business campaign demanded compensation for losing thousands of tourism and other enterprises .

charlie lennon , john 's uncle , died in hospital on sunday aged 83 .
mr lennon was admitted to the royal liverpool hospital 10 days ago in poor health .
charlie lennon was the youngest brother of john 's father freddie .
it is widely thought charlie was the favourite of the murdered former beatle 's merseyside family .
mr lennon was a chef and travelled all over the country before settling in brighton for a period .
some 16 years ago he returned to liverpool and lived in a flat in sefton park .
in early may mr lennon suffered a fall , and , after treatment at broadgreen hospital , his condition improved .
however , he developed an infection and was unable to fight it off .
his friends and neighbours said failing eyesight had caused him to become less active in recent years .
