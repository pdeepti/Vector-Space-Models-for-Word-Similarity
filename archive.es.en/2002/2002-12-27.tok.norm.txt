the official chinese news agency said the closures were a safety measure prompted by the deaths in june of 25 people in a fire at an internet cafe in beijing .
the report says nearly 12,000 other internet cafes have been closed until safety improvements are put in place .
but critics have accused the chinese government of using the safety issue as an excuse to impose tighter controls on the licensing of internet cafes .
safety concerns china 's minister for the state economic and trade commission , li rongrong , said that more than 45,000 internet cafes had been inspected in the country in the past six months , the official xinhua news agency reported .
many of china 's internet cafes are unlicensed and have no fire exits .
officials also complain about access to pornography and other online material deemed harmful .
the fire , at the lanjisu -lrb- blue hyperspeed -rrb- beijing 's university district , was the city 's worst in more than 50 years .
many of the victims were unable to escape because its doors were locked and iron bars covered many of the windows .
two young boys were sentenced to life in prison in august for deliberately starting the fire after being refused entry .
usage restricted although ostensibly the crackdown is to improve worker safety , bbc correspondent holly williams says that china is keen to crack down on web usage , especially internet chatrooms where anti-government opinions may be expressed .
under strict new laws introduced in november this year , children under the age of 16 were banned in internet cafes , managers must keep lists of all those using their facilities , and doors and windows must not be locked .
gambling , violence and pornography can not be promoted on the internet .
china has already heavily restricted internet usage in the country , with a recent us study finding that up to one in 10 websites were deliberately blocked to chinese internet users .
despite such restrictions the internet is hugely popular in china , with more than 45 million internet users as of mid-2002 , compared to just half a million in october 1997 .
however , as home computers become cheaper many , chinese are now using internet cafes to play computer games rather than to access websites .

rosetta is set to take off from south america on the night of 12 january for a nine-year-voyage past the planets . "
rosetta will join the nucleus of the comet as it travels in towards the sun from the cold parts of the solar system " dr geraint jones , imperial college launch preparations are continuing amid an independent investigation into a failed rocket launch in december .
the maiden flight of the new heavy-lift ariane 5 ended in disaster when it exploded over the atlantic ocean .
the first aim of the inquiry is to find out whether it has any implications for rosetta , which is due to be launched on the basic version of the rocket .
rosetta must be launched by the end of january if it is to reach its destination , comet wirtanen .
" if it does n't launch we are in deep trouble , " dr rita schulz of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , deputy project scientist for the rosetta mission , said .
" there is no back-up target . "
building blocks the esa probe must skirt the earth twice and mars once to gather the power to chase the comet .
it will catch up with the large , " dirty snowball " in the dark depths of the solar system where it will try to land a robot on a comet for the first time .
the spacecraft will then follow the comet as it hurtles towards the sun at up to 135,000 kilometres per hour , studying the dust and gas particles that trail behind it .
professor david southwood , director of science at esa , said the idea of a spacecraft being able to orbit and land on a comet was remarkable .
he told bbc news online : " comets , we believe , are the building blocks of the solar system - so to go out and ' scratch and sniff " a comet is going to take us back to the beginning where we all came from . "
long odyssey the journey to wirtanen is the furthest journey for a spacecraft powered only by the sun .
its destination comet was discovered in 1948 by carl wirtanen of the lick observatory in california .
wirtanen is one of a group of comets whose paths are influenced by jupiter , the largest planet in the solar system . "
we do n't know what it 's like to stand on the nucleus of a comet " dr geraint jones , imperial college london the mission is named after the famous rosetta stone - carved with inscriptions in egyptian and greek - found by a french soldier in egypt in 1799 .
the discovery of the basalt stone slab , written at the beginning of the 2nd century bc , unlocked the secrets of ancient egyptian writing .
scientists hope that rosetta will provide a similar insight into the ancient history of space and the planets .
fleeting glimpse comets are the leftovers of the stuff that formed the earth , moon and planets 4.5 billion years ago .
previous spacecraft have encountered the space bodies now and again but have been able to get only a fleeting glimpse of their make-up .
comets balls of ice and dust that did not get incorporated into planets when the solar system was formed .
analysis could reveal more about the solar system and perhaps life on earth " until now , missions to comets have flown past very quickly in a matter of hours , " said dr geraint jones of the space and atmospheric physics department at imperial college london .
" the big difference with rosetta is that it will actually join the nucleus of the comet as it travels in towards the sun from the cold parts of the solar system . "
rosetta will reach the comet at its farthest point from the sun , around november 2011 .
the spacecraft will drop a lander on to its nucleus and will chase wirtanen as it speeds towards the sun .
rosetta will then orbit the comet , scanning its surface for an entire year , as it moves closer to the star .
instruments on board the spacecraft will study the dust and gas particles that surround the comet and trail behind it as streaming tails .
they will measure the chemical composition of gases given off as ices evaporate and capture images of the centre of the comet as it melts .
many of the molecules that are given off by the nucleus can not be seen using telescopes .
" there 's a good chance that rosetta will be able to detect molecules that have n't been detected before because they are so unstable , " said dr jones .
perilous landing the most exciting part of the mission will be the attempt to land a robotic probe on the icy heart of the comet .
it is hoped that the main orbiter will be able to get to about one kilometre from wirtanen before releasing the lander .
if all goes well , the robot will take close-up images of the comet and a microscope will look in detail at its surface .
" because the nucleus is so small , the pull of gravity will be extremely weak , " explained dr jones .
" it will be more like a docking than a landing . "
this sort of manoeuvre has only been tried once before , when the nasa spacecraft near landed on the asteroid eros .
eros is much bigger , though , than wirtanen , so exerts a bigger pull .
furthermore , nobody knows whether the heart of a comet is soft , slushy stuff or hard ice .
" we do n't know what it 's like to stand on the nucleus of a comet - what the landscape would look like , " he said .
" just that is exciting in itself .
" for years people have discussed if the nucleus is a hard , icy surface or if it is covered in fluffy snow .
" finally , we will learn what the truth is . "
