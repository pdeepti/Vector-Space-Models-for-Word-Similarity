the anti-globalisation – which has at its root a dislike of the neo-liberal agenda , the growth in power of multinational corporations and the increasing divide between rich and poor – was born out of demonstrations at the world trade organisation meeting in seattle in 1999 . searching for alternatives hugo braun , of the german anti-globalisation group attac-deutschland , told deutsche welle radio in cologne that many in the anti-globalisation movement are simply fed up with protesting against globalisation and want to work at finding solutions . “ of course , when one protests against something , it follows that you ask yourself what the alternative could be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.11.2002 business in britain cools on euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two-thirds of british voters are against joining the eurozone with the eurozone 's current poor economic performance and germany 's breach of the 3 percent budget deficit , ecomomists in britain are becoming increasingly cautious about joining the monetary union . when germany was considering a common european currency back in the mid 90s , it worried about joining a club that included a country - italy -whose public sector debt stood at a soaring 124 percent .
the german government , at that time under helmut kohl , reacted with calls for a set of tough fiscal regulations , rules designed to prevent countries like italy from overspending .
the result - today 's growth and stability pact - convinced germany to abandon the d-mark and to join its european neighbors in adopting the euro .
today , britain , which is still in the process of contemplating membership in the monetary union , is faced with a similar question .
this time , however , it is germany that is causing the worries .
concern over germany germany , which has admitted it will exceed the 3 percent budget deficit allowed under the growth and stability pact rules , faces a humiliating reprimand from the european commission next week .
in addition , economic growth is crawling at some 0.3 percent and unemployment continues to waver around the four million mark .
to top it all off , experts forecast no end to germany 's economic malaise in the coming months .
as a result , wariness in british business circles regarding joining the eurozone is spreading .
a recent report , published in the british " daily telegraph " this week , showed that only 2 of 21 questioned top economists expected the eu to meet a set of five tests introduced by the british government in 1997 by which it will judge the benefit of adopting the euro for the uk economy .
15 economists said they thought the criteria would not be fulfilled .
many of the those questioned named germany 's trailing economy as the main reason for their reserve , along with the widening rift between the economic development in britain and the euro countries .
economic divide growth in the eurozone runs at around half of britain ’ s 1.5 percent .
consumer demand has surged by more than 3 percent in the uk ; in europe it dwindles at just under one percent .
unemployment in britain is considerably lower than the eu average , running at around half the eurozone 's 8 percent .
in short , britain 's economy is now in its 10th year of expansion , the longest for 40 years .
it is hard to deny the role the euro has played in europe 's current economic malaise .
once described as " europe 's key to the 21st century " by the german chancellor , the euro and the economic policies which have accompanied its introduction have lamed germany in its attempt to haul itself out its economic slump .
this scenario , critics across the channel say , only goes to prove that a one-size-fits-all economic policy simply does not work .
not just bad news however , the single currency has boosted trade between countries in the eurozone considerably , increasing by some 20 percent since 1998 .
in germany , trade with other eu countries as a proportion of gdp has risen by 4.8 percent since 1998 .
the only country where trade has dropped with eu members is britain .
that the eurozone is proving increasingly attractive to investors due to the absence of the currency risk is a fact britain is finding hard to ignore .
the latest figures on foreign direct investment from the united nations conference on trade and development show that britain 's share of investment in the eu has fallen from 28 percent in 1998 to a forecasted 5 percent this year .
but france and germany have attracted more investment than britain for the first time since 1984 .
not enthusiastic , but necessary the ambiguity of britain 's approach to the euro is well reflected in a recent study published by the engineering employers ' foundation .
despite the eurozone 's current poor performance , manufacturers see the adoption of the euro as inevitable .
more than half of respondents in the survey expressed caution as to britain joining the eurozone , but said it was " likely " to join by 2005 .
this " wait-and-see " attitude fits the government 's focus on the " five tests " with which britain is evaluating the european economy to see how it will influence britain .
with these the government will judge whether a single currency is good for jobs , foreign investment , britain 's financial center in london , and whether britain 's economy is marching in step with that of the rest of the eu .
the attitude adopted in britain 's business circles also matches that of the british public .
voters are still largely reluctant about joining the eurozone , with two-thirds of them saying they do not want a single currency .
four-fifths , however , believe britain will join by the end of the decade .
this shows that despite britain 's reserve , it has been widely accepted among voters that membership in the monetary union is inevitable .
earlier this year , british prime minister said he believed " passionately " that it was the uk 's " destiny " to be at the heart of europe .

the german government , at that time under helmut kohl , reacted with calls for a set of tough fiscal regulations , rules designed to prevent countries like italy from overspending .
the result - today 's growth and stability pact - convinced germany to abandon the d-mark and to join its european neighbors in adopting the euro .
today , britain , which is still in the process of contemplating membership in the monetary union , is faced with a similar question .
this time , however , it is germany that is causing the worries .
concern over germany germany , which has admitted it will exceed the 3 percent budget deficit allowed under the growth and stability pact rules , faces a humiliating reprimand from the european commission next week .
in addition , economic growth is crawling at some 0.3 percent and unemployment continues to waver around the four million mark .
to top it all off , experts forecast no end to germany 's economic malaise in the coming months .
as a result , wariness in british business circles regarding joining the eurozone is spreading .
a recent report , published in the british " daily telegraph " this week , showed that only 2 of 21 questioned top economists expected the eu to meet a set of five tests introduced by the british government in 1997 by which it will judge the benefit of adopting the euro for the uk economy .
15 economists said they thought the criteria would not be fulfilled .
many of the those questioned named germany 's trailing economy as the main reason for their reserve , along with the widening rift between the economic development in britain and the euro countries .
economic divide growth in the eurozone runs at around half of britain ’ s 1.5 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.11.2002 business in britain cools on euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two-thirds of british voters are against joining the eurozone with the eurozone 's current poor economic performance and germany 's breach of the 3 percent budget deficit , ecomomists in britain are becoming increasingly cautious about joining the monetary union . when germany was considering a common european currency back in the mid 90s , it worried about joining a club that included a country - italy -whose public sector debt stood at a soaring 124 percent .
the german government , at that time under helmut kohl , reacted with calls for a set of tough fiscal regulations , rules designed to prevent countries like italy from overspending .
the result - today 's growth and stability pact - convinced germany to abandon the d-mark and to join its european neighbors in adopting the euro .
today , britain , which is still in the process of contemplating membership in the monetary union , is faced with a similar question .
this time , however , it is germany that is causing the worries .
concern over germany germany , which has admitted it will exceed the 3 percent budget deficit allowed under the growth and stability pact rules , faces a humiliating reprimand from the european commission next week .
in addition , economic growth is crawling at some 0.3 percent and unemployment continues to waver around the four million mark .
to top it all off , experts forecast no end to germany 's economic malaise in the coming months .
as a result , wariness in british business circles regarding joining the eurozone is spreading .
a recent report , published in the british " daily telegraph " this week , showed that only 2 of 21 questioned top economists expected the eu to meet a set of five tests introduced by the british government in 1997 by which it will judge the benefit of adopting the euro for the uk economy .
15 economists said they thought the criteria would not be fulfilled .
many of the those questioned named germany 's trailing economy as the main reason for their reserve , along with the widening rift between the economic development in britain and the euro countries .
economic divide growth in the eurozone runs at around half of britain ’ s 1.5 percent .
consumer demand has surged by more than 3 percent in the uk ; in europe it dwindles at just under one percent .
unemployment in britain is considerably lower than the eu average , running at around half the eurozone 's 8 percent .
in short , britain 's economy is now in its 10th year of expansion , the longest for 40 years .
it is hard to deny the role the euro has played in europe 's current economic malaise .
once described as " europe 's key to the 21st century " by the german chancellor , the euro and the economic policies which have accompanied its introduction have lamed germany in its attempt to haul itself out its economic slump .
this scenario , critics across the channel say , only goes to prove that a one-size-fits-all economic policy simply does not work .
not just bad news however , the single currency has boosted trade between countries in the eurozone considerably , increasing by some 20 percent since 1998 .
in germany , trade with other eu countries as a proportion of gdp has risen by 4.8 percent since 1998 .
the only country where trade has dropped with eu members is britain .
that the eurozone is proving increasingly attractive to investors due to the absence of the currency risk is a fact britain is finding hard to ignore .
the latest figures on foreign direct investment from the united nations conference on trade and development show that britain 's share of investment in the eu has fallen from 28 percent in 1998 to a forecasted 5 percent this year .
but france and germany have attracted more investment than britain for the first time since 1984 .
not enthusiastic , but necessary the ambiguity of britain 's approach to the euro is well reflected in a recent study published by the engineering employers ' foundation .
despite the eurozone 's current poor performance , manufacturers see the adoption of the euro as inevitable .
more than half of respondents in the survey expressed caution as to britain joining the eurozone , but said it was " likely " to join by 2005 .
this " wait-and-see " attitude fits the government 's focus on the " five tests " with which britain is evaluating the european economy to see how it will influence britain .
with these the government will judge whether a single currency is good for jobs , foreign investment , britain 's financial center in london , and whether britain 's economy is marching in step with that of the rest of the eu .
the attitude adopted in britain 's business circles also matches that of the british public .
voters are still largely reluctant about joining the eurozone , with two-thirds of them saying they do not want a single currency .
four-fifths , however , believe britain will join by the end of the decade .
this shows that despite britain 's reserve , it has been widely accepted among voters that membership in the monetary union is inevitable .
earlier this year , british prime minister said he believed " passionately " that it was the uk 's " destiny " to be at the heart of europe .

the german government , at that time under helmut kohl , reacted with calls for a set of tough fiscal regulations , rules designed to prevent countries like italy from overspending .
the result - today 's growth and stability pact - convinced germany to abandon the d-mark and to join its european neighbors in adopting the euro .
today , britain , which is still in the process of contemplating membership in the monetary union , is faced with a similar question .
this time , however , it is germany that is causing the worries .
concern over germany germany , which has admitted it will exceed the 3 percent budget deficit allowed under the growth and stability pact rules , faces a humiliating reprimand from the european commission next week .
in addition , economic growth is crawling at some 0.3 percent and unemployment continues to waver around the four million mark .
to top it all off , experts forecast no end to germany 's economic malaise in the coming months .
as a result , wariness in british business circles regarding joining the eurozone is spreading .
a recent report , published in the british " daily telegraph " this week , showed that only 2 of 21 questioned top economists expected the eu to meet a set of five tests introduced by the british government in 1997 by which it will judge the benefit of adopting the euro for the uk economy .
15 economists said they thought the criteria would not be fulfilled .
many of the those questioned named germany 's trailing economy as the main reason for their reserve , along with the widening rift between the economic development in britain and the euro countries .
economic divide growth in the eurozone runs at around half of britain ’ s 1.5 percent .
consumer demand has surged by more than 3 percent in the uk ; in europe it dwindles at just under one percent .
unemployment in britain is considerably lower than the eu average , running at around half the eurozone 's 8 percent .
in short , britain 's economy is now in its 10th year of expansion , the longest for 40 years .
it is hard to deny the role the euro has played in europe 's current economic malaise .
once described as " europe 's key to the 21st century " by the german chancellor , the euro and the economic policies which have accompanied its introduction have lamed germany in its attempt to haul itself out its economic slump .
this scenario , critics across the channel say , only goes to prove that a one-size-fits-all economic policy simply does not work .
not just bad news however , the single currency has boosted trade between countries in the eurozone considerably , increasing by some 20 percent since 1998 .
in germany , trade with other eu countries as a proportion of gdp has risen by 4.8 percent since 1998 .
the only country where trade has dropped with eu members is britain .
that the eurozone is proving increasingly attractive to investors due to the absence of the currency risk is a fact britain is finding hard to ignore .
the latest figures on foreign direct investment from the united nations conference on trade and development show that britain 's share of investment in the eu has fallen from 28 percent in 1998 to a forecasted 5 percent this year .
but france and germany have attracted more investment than britain for the first time since 1984 .
not enthusiastic , but necessary the ambiguity of britain 's approach to the euro is well reflected in a recent study published by the engineering employers ' foundation .
despite the eurozone 's current poor performance , manufacturers see the adoption of the euro as inevitable .
more than half of respondents in the survey expressed caution as to britain joining the eurozone , but said it was " likely " to join by 2005 .
this " wait-and-see " attitude fits the government 's focus on the " five tests " with which britain is evaluating the european economy to see how it will influence britain .
with these the government will judge whether a single currency is good for jobs , foreign investment , britain 's financial center in london , and whether britain 's economy is marching in step with that of the rest of the eu .
the attitude adopted in britain 's business circles also matches that of the british public .
voters are still largely reluctant about joining the eurozone , with two-thirds of them saying they do not want a single currency .
four-fifths , however , believe britain will join by the end of the decade .
this shows that despite britain 's reserve , it has been widely accepted among voters that membership in the monetary union is inevitable .
earlier this year , british prime minister said he believed " passionately " that it was the uk 's " destiny " to be at the heart of europe .
britain 's people may well have accepted this destiny .

new wto boss supachai : does he make a difference ? by steve schifferes bbc news online economics reporter the world trade organisation has done little to boost free trade , a leading academic researcher has said .
professor andrew rose of the university of california at berkeley says that membership of the wto does little to increase trade flows .
factors boosting trade regional trade pacts currency union common language common border special trade preferences in the past 50 years , world trade has soared , growing more than 20 times , twice as fast as the world economy has grown .
up to now , economists and officials at the wto have assumed that the six rounds of world trade talks , which resulted in a massive lowering of tariff barriers to let in cheap imports , played an important role in this process .
according to professor rose 's study , covering 175 countries between 1950 and 2000 , there was no correlation between a country 's membership of the wto -lrb- which used to be called gatt -rrb- and an increase in the volume of its trade .
the wto has fought for free trade for 50 years the argument comes at a difficult time for the wto , which is struggling to implement the latest round of trade talks , launched one year ago at doha , qatar .
rich governments pledged at that time to make sure that any new trade deal would benefit the world 's poor countries .
but the new wto trade boss , supachai panitchpakdi , faces an uphill struggle getting them to deliver , especially on agriculture .
paradox professor rose says that the reason for the lack of correlation is that even when countries join the wto , they are not necessarily obliged to open up their markets .
he cites the example of india , which was a founding member of the international trade organisation but continued to raise its tariff barriers for many years .
in contrast , china , although not admitted to the wto until 2001 , opened its economy to western investment in the 1980s and saw a huge growth in trade .
and , despite the effectiveness of negotiations aimed at lowering tariffs , professor rose says that all kinds of other trade barriers -lrb- which may be consistent with wto rules -rrb- are still used to keep out goods which threaten livelihoods .
the recent steel tariffs imposed by the us on many of its trading partners , in order to prevent job losses at domestic steel plants , is a recent example .
democracy and free trade although professor rose says he personally believes free trade benefits countries , he also agrees with his colleague dani rodrik that it is hard to reconcile the existence of nation states , democracy , and complete international economic integration .
professor rose argues that it is economic integration - or globalisation - that is far less complete than we have been led to believe , with all sorts of barriers , especially to developing country exports to rich countries .
his research also shows that certain types of trade deals do have huge benefits .
regional deals in particular , regional free trade deals , such as those between eu states , or between the us , canada , and mexico -lrb- members of the nafta trade bloc -rrb- , do boost to trade .
and currency unions , in his view , have just as big an effect - he predicts that the creation of the eurozone will drive further european economic integration .
other things that facilitate trade between countries are a common language , a history of colonisation , and a common border .
professor rose says that trade deals specifically aimed at helping developing countries , such as the generalised system of preferences introduced in the 1960s , can also help lower trade barriers .
limits of globalisation in broad terms , professor rose 's work points to the limits of globalisation .
despite the rapid rise in trade volumes , world trade is far from " free " , and there are even greater restrictions on the movement of capital , and especially labour .
in the late 19th century , the first great wave of globalisation transformed the transatlantic economy , leading to the rise of the us as an economic superpower .
now , a similar process might be at work in east asia .
but as the economic historian nick crafts has pointed out , the spread of globalisation has always been uneven .
large , well-resourced countries with growing populations and internal markets , such as the us and now china , may be better placed to take advantage of the opportunities provided by globalisation than their smaller rivals .
professor rose was speaking at seminar organised by the centre for economic policy research in london .

in the commons on tuesday , home office minister beverley hughes said the proposed site at a disused air base in throckmorton was no longer viable .
local councillors and the area 's mp claimed it as a victory for the village which last year was used as a burial site for the remains of cattle killed in the foot-and-mouth crisis .
however , protestors say they will now back the fight to prevent two similar asylum centres being sited in rural parts of northamptonshire and oxfordshire .
our campaign is not about us not wanting asylum seekers in our part of the world , but that rural areas are the wrong places to house them steve mitchell , protestors ' spokesman in her commons statement , ms hughes said the throckmorton site had been dropped because the government could not acquire the land quickly enough to meet its own timescale .
the conservative mp for mid-worcester , peter luff , said : " there 's going to be a huge sense of relief in throckmorton and all the villages around it .
" this should never have been imposed on them in the first place .
" it was the wrong policy in the wrong place .
the government has backed down and i 'm glad of that . "
' best news ' gary robinson , chairman of wyre piddle parish council , said he was " absolutely delighted " .
he said : " it 's the best news we could have expected .
" we have fought a long and hard campaign to show the government they were absolutely wrong to think of putting asylum seekers out in a rural area like throckmorton . "
local campaigners have been more guarded in their reaction .
steve mitchell , spokesman for pact -lrb- protest at the asylum centre in throckmorton -rrb- says the government should now abandon all plans to site asylum seekers in the countryside .
he told bbc news online : " we 're extremely pleased from throckmorton 's point of view , but it 's not unbridled joy .
' support ' offered " a large part of our campaign is not about us not wanting asylum seekers in our part of the world , but that rural areas are the wrong places to house them .
" the government should listen to voices like the refugee council who say urban areas are better places to build these centres .
" this is great news for us but the fact that two other rural sites are still likely to be used is bad news for asylum seekers .
" we will lend our support to other campaigns . "
ms hughes told the commons the government would continue to " pursue vigorously " plans for large scale holding centres in bicester and newton .

he is due to hold talks with the foreign minister later on wednesday .

this year 's meeting is expected to focus on the us-led war on terror and the ongoing military operation in afghanistan .
washington is a close military ally of seoul , with 37,000 american troops stationed in the south to counter any threat from the north .

washington has rejected offers by the north for discussions about its nuclear concerns , saying the regime must first dismantle its nuclear programme before any such talks can begin .
japanese officials repeated that demand during talks with north korea last month , aimed at normalising relations .
