the legal document and the video tape that is rumored to show both bernd juergen b and the perpetrator eating the victim 's flesh and the subsequent murder support suggestions that victim and killer both engaged in consensual cannibalism .
legal document suggests victim went to death willingly according to police reports bernd juergen b wrote out his will and had it officially recognized by a notary on the morning of his disappearance march 9 , 2001 .
in the will , he left the bulk of his estate including a lavish penthouse apartment and his collection of expensive computer equipment to his live-in partner , a man named rene .
the german daily berliner morgenpost reports that rene knew nothing of the victim 's plans and discovered the will only after bernd juergen b was reported missing .
the victim reportedly sold most of his other belongings , including a sports car just before his disappearance .
bernd juergen b had told his boss at siemens he was taking that friday off " to attend to some personal matters " .
he was last seen at a subway station in berlin when co-workers caught sight of him .
the german police believe the victim then traveled 300 kilometers from berlin to the alleged murderer 's rambling half-timbered house near kassel with several thousand euro in cash and his passport .
the 42-year-old victim , a computer chip developer at siemens corporation in berlin , willingly allowed himself to be led to the slaughter , police said .
evidence shows that both men consented to cannibalism " the victim appeared to be fully aware of the situation , " an investigator said .
" videotape material definitely shows both him and the suspect engaged in eating his own flesh prior to his death . "
police officers who have been studying the evidence , including the video made by the suspect of the final moments of his victim 's life , were said to be undergoing psychiatric counseling .
an official statement on friday said the video shows the victim willingly allowed himself to be castrated before both men engaged in eating his severed flesh .
after murdering the victim , the killer , only identified as armin m , apparently removed body parts for consumption and buried the rest .
during a search of the killer 's home , police found frozen human flesh and skeletal remains , and a cellar which had been renovated into a makeshift slaughterhouse , complete with trough drains and meat hooks .
police used diggers to unearth body parts on the grounds of armin m 's sprawling 17th century estate in the idyllic central german town of rotenburg an der fulda .
police have found no indications that more than one person 's remains had been disposed of on the estate .
adverts for willing victims led police to killer authorities filed murder charges against the reclusive computer systems expert on thursday .
the 41-year-old suspect admitted to investigators that he had videotaped himself killing the man who he had met via a gay internet chat room after the victim responded to one of 80 adverts that read : ' gay male seeks hunks 18-30 to slaughter . '
both men were computer experts and were both described as ' internet addicts ' by colleagues .
it was revealed on friday that a chat room user tipped police off to the existence of armin m 's grisly adverts .
investigators now know of at least five respondents to the ad , in addition to the undercover officers who answered it and quickly determined it was meant literally .
neighbors describe killer as ' a pleasant and polite man ' neighbors describe the murder suspect as a pleasant and polite man who kept to himself .
he served in the german armed forces as a non- commissioned officer in ordinance for 12 years where was described as an amiable and conscientious military man .
after leaving the military in 1991 , armin m trained as a computer technician and until recently had a job with a software firm in the rhine valley city of karlsruhe , 30km south of rotenburg .
he lived with his mother in the 17th century half-timbered manor house , staying on there after her death three years ago .
" he was a mama 's boy , " a neighbor told reporters .
" he was totally fixated on his mother , who he said never let him date girls .
after she died , he began to thaw out . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police investigate alleged cannibal murder germans woke up on thursday to the traumatic news that a man had killed and eaten another man with the victim 's approval .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.12.2002 a new europe is born großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we are family : the eu agrees on expansion after doubts and debate , a new dawn breaks in europe with an agreement that will bring ten new countries , many from the formerly communist east , into the european union . two days of high pressure bargaining and dealing in copenhagen have culminated in the european union agreeing on an historic decision to expand eastwards and welcome ten new member , stretching the eu deep into ex-soviet territory and pushing its boundaries closer to the middle east .
at points during the discussions in the danish capital , it looked like there would be no groundbreaking moves with divisions setting members at odds .
the sticking points included the financial packages expected by the poorer newcomers , the question over future talks on turkey 's accession and the spilt membership problems of cyprus .
failure to reach a compromised on these subjects threatened to put the brakes on expansion .
eu invites the ten new members to join in may 2004 but in the late hours of friday night , to relieved and welcome celebration , a funding deal was finally struck and the 15-nation eu invited cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia to join the western members of the club in may 2004 .
the breakthrough came after germany , the eu 's traditional paymaster , said an extra one billion euro -lrb- $ 1.02bn -rrb- was on offer to appease the candidates despite the eu insisting for weeks that no more money would be forthcoming .
other nations also dug deep to grease the wheels of expansion .
" it is a great day for europe and also for germany , because one does n't go without the other , " german chancellor gerhard schroeder told a press conference , while warning that the eu 's expansion should not lead to its dilution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi .
european commission president romano prodi addressing the press said : " for the first time in history , europe will become one because unification is the free will of its people " .
europe 's people still have their say as to whether unification goes ahead in every country .
the candidate countries still face referendums at home and it is thought that this may prove a troublesome task in some states , especially poland .
poland 's position prompts cash injection and seals deal poland , the biggest of the 10 candidates and heavily dependent on agriculture , finally came on board after its demands for better terms sent the two-day summit into overtime .
its plea that polish farmers would face ruin without larger subsidies was appeased by half of the two billion euro that poland had asked for .
a referendum in poland may prove to be a difficult proposition for its pro-europe government .
poland 's leaders had to fight tooth and nail for a better deal for its millions of farmers but the people may demand more than the compromise offered and threaten to derail poland 's accession if they do n't get it .
but with everyone expected on board , europe 's leaders had every right to feel happy with their work .
eu honors the fall of the berlin wall - rasmussen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
" in 1989 , brave and visionary people tore down the berlin wall .
they would no longer tolerate the forced division of europe .
today we have delivered on their hopes , " said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , to the press .
" we decided to heal our continent .
we decided to create one europe .
welcome to our new family .
our new europe is born . "
it will be a considerably larger europe .
the eu 's population will rise by 75 million people after enlargement to more than 450 million - eclipsing the north american free trade area as the world 's biggest economic zone .
turkey the unhappy guests as talks scheduled for 2004 however , amid the initial congratulations , there were still some unhappy faces .
turkey grudgingly accepted an agreed delay to its own long-running membership drive with the eu pencilling in a date for accession talks for december 2004 .
turkey did agree to allow nato and the eu to forge a long-awaited military pact that will allow the union to launch its first-ever peacekeeping operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister abdullah gul .
the decision to delay turkey 's accession is a move that is unsatisfactory to the united states government , who were hoping turkey 's rapid inclusion would help shore up allies around the troubled middle east .
the decision , backed strongly by france and germany , also put britain in an awkward position and went against the pro-american ideas of the spanish and italian governments .
but the leaders confirmed that the eu 's enlargement process was " irreversible " and would eventually take in bulgaria , romania and turkey .
we will determine our own borders - prodi " our work is not yet finished , " romano prodi said in what could be construed as a disguised rebuff to the united states for its strident support for turkey 's eu bid .
" where the borders of europe lie is something the europeans must discuss and decide for themselves .
we must not accept that the borders of the union be imposed on us from outside , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides with turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash .
the image of european unity was not 100 percent achieved due to the failure of last-ditch un-brokered talks in copenhagen to end the 28-year division of cyprus .
both the greek and turkish cypriots were unable to bridge their differences and so the eu had no choice but to keep its promise to invite the internationally recognized greek-cypriot government alone .
deal aims to eradicate war in europe and heal divisions but the majority of the celebrations were well deserved .
the eu is now on a path to a five-decade drive towards " ever closer union " which began with a coal and steel community agreement back in 1951 .
this latest step is seen as a concerted effort to bind europe so close it can never go to war again and end the lingering cold war divisions .
in a final message of hope for the newly enlarged union , danish premier fogh rasmussen said , " today we have closed one of the bloodiest and darkest chapters in european history .
today we have opened a new chapter . "

the legal document and the video tape that is rumored to show both bernd juergen b and the perpetrator eating the victim 's flesh and the subsequent murder support suggestions that victim and killer both engaged in consensual cannibalism .
legal document suggests victim went to death willingly according to police reports bernd juergen b wrote out his will and had it officially recognized by a notary on the morning of his disappearance march 9 , 2001 .
in the will , he left the bulk of his estate including a lavish penthouse apartment and his collection of expensive computer equipment to his live-in partner , a man named rene .

the legal document and the video tape that is rumored to show both bernd juergen b and the perpetrator eating the victim 's flesh and the subsequent murder support suggestions that victim and killer both engaged in consensual cannibalism .
legal document suggests victim went to death willingly according to police reports bernd juergen b wrote out his will and had it officially recognized by a notary on the morning of his disappearance march 9 , 2001 .
in the will , he left the bulk of his estate including a lavish penthouse apartment and his collection of expensive computer equipment to his live-in partner , a man named rene .
the german daily berliner morgenpost reports that rene knew nothing of the victim 's plans and discovered the will only after bernd juergen b was reported missing .
the victim reportedly sold most of his other belongings , including a sports car just before his disappearance .
bernd juergen b had told his boss at siemens he was taking that friday off " to attend to some personal matters " .
he was last seen at a subway station in berlin when co-workers caught sight of him .
the german police believe the victim then traveled 300 kilometers from berlin to the alleged murderer 's rambling half-timbered house near kassel with several thousand euro in cash and his passport .
the 42-year-old victim , a computer chip developer at siemens corporation in berlin , willingly allowed himself to be led to the slaughter , police said .
evidence shows that both men consented to cannibalism " the victim appeared to be fully aware of the situation , " an investigator said .
" videotape material definitely shows both him and the suspect engaged in eating his own flesh prior to his death . "
police officers who have been studying the evidence , including the video made by the suspect of the final moments of his victim 's life , were said to be undergoing psychiatric counseling .
an official statement on friday said the video shows the victim willingly allowed himself to be castrated before both men engaged in eating his severed flesh .
after murdering the victim , the killer , only identified as armin m , apparently removed body parts for consumption and buried the rest .
during a search of the killer 's home , police found frozen human flesh and skeletal remains , and a cellar which had been renovated into a makeshift slaughterhouse , complete with trough drains and meat hooks .
police used diggers to unearth body parts on the grounds of armin m 's sprawling 17th century estate in the idyllic central german town of rotenburg an der fulda .
police have found no indications that more than one person 's remains had been disposed of on the estate .
adverts for willing victims led police to killer authorities filed murder charges against the reclusive computer systems expert on thursday .
the 41-year-old suspect admitted to investigators that he had videotaped himself killing the man who he had met via a gay internet chat room after the victim responded to one of 80 adverts that read : ' gay male seeks hunks 18-30 to slaughter . '
both men were computer experts and were both described as ' internet addicts ' by colleagues .
it was revealed on friday that a chat room user tipped police off to the existence of armin m 's grisly adverts .
investigators now know of at least five respondents to the ad , in addition to the undercover officers who answered it and quickly determined it was meant literally .
neighbors describe killer as ' a pleasant and polite man ' neighbors describe the murder suspect as a pleasant and polite man who kept to himself .
he served in the german armed forces as a non- commissioned officer in ordinance for 12 years where was described as an amiable and conscientious military man .
after leaving the military in 1991 , armin m trained as a computer technician and until recently had a job with a software firm in the rhine valley city of karlsruhe , 30km south of rotenburg .

at points during the discussions in the danish capital , it looked like there would be no groundbreaking moves with divisions setting members at odds .
the sticking points included the financial packages expected by the poorer newcomers , the question over future talks on turkey 's accession and the spilt membership problems of cyprus .
failure to reach a compromised on these subjects threatened to put the brakes on expansion .
eu invites the ten new members to join in may 2004 but in the late hours of friday night , to relieved and welcome celebration , a funding deal was finally struck and the 15-nation eu invited cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia to join the western members of the club in may 2004 .
the breakthrough came after germany , the eu 's traditional paymaster , said an extra one billion euro -lrb- $ 1.02bn -rrb- was on offer to appease the candidates despite the eu insisting for weeks that no more money would be forthcoming .
other nations also dug deep to grease the wheels of expansion .
" it is a great day for europe and also for germany , because one does n't go without the other , " german chancellor gerhard schroeder told a press conference , while warning that the eu 's expansion should not lead to its dilution .

european commission president romano prodi addressing the press said : " for the first time in history , europe will become one because unification is the free will of its people " .
europe 's people still have their say as to whether unification goes ahead in every country .
the candidate countries still face referendums at home and it is thought that this may prove a troublesome task in some states , especially poland .
poland 's position prompts cash injection and seals deal poland , the biggest of the 10 candidates and heavily dependent on agriculture , finally came on board after its demands for better terms sent the two-day summit into overtime .
its plea that polish farmers would face ruin without larger subsidies was appeased by half of the two billion euro that poland had asked for .
a referendum in poland may prove to be a difficult proposition for its pro-europe government .
poland 's leaders had to fight tooth and nail for a better deal for its millions of farmers but the people may demand more than the compromise offered and threaten to derail poland 's accession if they do n't get it .

turkey the unhappy guests as talks scheduled for 2004 however , amid the initial congratulations , there were still some unhappy faces .
turkey grudgingly accepted an agreed delay to its own long-running membership drive with the eu pencilling in a date for accession talks for december 2004 .
turkey did agree to allow nato and the eu to forge a long-awaited military pact that will allow the union to launch its first-ever peacekeeping operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister abdullah gul .
the decision to delay turkey 's accession is a move that is unsatisfactory to the united states government , who were hoping turkey 's rapid inclusion would help shore up allies around the troubled middle east .
the decision , backed strongly by france and germany , also put britain in an awkward position and went against the pro-american ideas of the spanish and italian governments .

the image of european unity was not 100 percent achieved due to the failure of last-ditch un-brokered talks in copenhagen to end the 28-year division of cyprus .
both the greek and turkish cypriots were unable to bridge their differences and so the eu had no choice but to keep its promise to invite the internationally recognized greek-cypriot government alone .

the eu is now on a path to a five-decade drive towards " ever closer union " which began with a coal and steel community agreement back in 1951 .

the legal document and the video tape that is rumored to show both bernd juergen b and the perpetrator eating the victim 's flesh and the subsequent murder support suggestions that victim and killer both engaged in consensual cannibalism .
legal document suggests victim went to death willingly according to police reports bernd juergen b wrote out his will and had it officially recognized by a notary on the morning of his disappearance march 9 , 2001 .
in the will , he left the bulk of his estate including a lavish penthouse apartment and his collection of expensive computer equipment to his live-in partner , a man named rene .
the german daily berliner morgenpost reports that rene knew nothing of the victim 's plans and discovered the will only after bernd juergen b was reported missing .
the victim reportedly sold most of his other belongings , including a sports car just before his disappearance .
bernd juergen b had told his boss at siemens he was taking that friday off " to attend to some personal matters " .
he was last seen at a subway station in berlin when co-workers caught sight of him .
the german police believe the victim then traveled 300 kilometers from berlin to the alleged murderer 's rambling half-timbered house near kassel with several thousand euro in cash and his passport .
the 42-year-old victim , a computer chip developer at siemens corporation in berlin , willingly allowed himself to be led to the slaughter , police said .
evidence shows that both men consented to cannibalism " the victim appeared to be fully aware of the situation , " an investigator said .
" videotape material definitely shows both him and the suspect engaged in eating his own flesh prior to his death . "
police officers who have been studying the evidence , including the video made by the suspect of the final moments of his victim 's life , were said to be undergoing psychiatric counseling .
an official statement on friday said the video shows the victim willingly allowed himself to be castrated before both men engaged in eating his severed flesh .
after murdering the victim , the killer , only identified as armin m , apparently removed body parts for consumption and buried the rest .
during a search of the killer 's home , police found frozen human flesh and skeletal remains , and a cellar which had been renovated into a makeshift slaughterhouse , complete with trough drains and meat hooks .
police used diggers to unearth body parts on the grounds of armin m 's sprawling 17th century estate in the idyllic central german town of rotenburg an der fulda .
police have found no indications that more than one person 's remains had been disposed of on the estate .
adverts for willing victims led police to killer authorities filed murder charges against the reclusive computer systems expert on thursday .
the 41-year-old suspect admitted to investigators that he had videotaped himself killing the man who he had met via a gay internet chat room after the victim responded to one of 80 adverts that read : ' gay male seeks hunks 18-30 to slaughter . '
both men were computer experts and were both described as ' internet addicts ' by colleagues .
it was revealed on friday that a chat room user tipped police off to the existence of armin m 's grisly adverts .
investigators now know of at least five respondents to the ad , in addition to the undercover officers who answered it and quickly determined it was meant literally .
neighbors describe killer as ' a pleasant and polite man ' neighbors describe the murder suspect as a pleasant and polite man who kept to himself .
he served in the german armed forces as a non- commissioned officer in ordinance for 12 years where was described as an amiable and conscientious military man .
after leaving the military in 1991 , armin m trained as a computer technician and until recently had a job with a software firm in the rhine valley city of karlsruhe , 30km south of rotenburg .
he lived with his mother in the 17th century half-timbered manor house , staying on there after her death three years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.12.2002 a new europe is born großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we are family : the eu agrees on expansion after doubts and debate , a new dawn breaks in europe with an agreement that will bring ten new countries , many from the formerly communist east , into the european union . two days of high pressure bargaining and dealing in copenhagen have culminated in the european union agreeing on an historic decision to expand eastwards and welcome ten new member , stretching the eu deep into ex-soviet territory and pushing its boundaries closer to the middle east .
at points during the discussions in the danish capital , it looked like there would be no groundbreaking moves with divisions setting members at odds .
the sticking points included the financial packages expected by the poorer newcomers , the question over future talks on turkey 's accession and the spilt membership problems of cyprus .
failure to reach a compromised on these subjects threatened to put the brakes on expansion .
eu invites the ten new members to join in may 2004 but in the late hours of friday night , to relieved and welcome celebration , a funding deal was finally struck and the 15-nation eu invited cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia to join the western members of the club in may 2004 .
the breakthrough came after germany , the eu 's traditional paymaster , said an extra one billion euro -lrb- $ 1.02bn -rrb- was on offer to appease the candidates despite the eu insisting for weeks that no more money would be forthcoming .
other nations also dug deep to grease the wheels of expansion .
" it is a great day for europe and also for germany , because one does n't go without the other , " german chancellor gerhard schroeder told a press conference , while warning that the eu 's expansion should not lead to its dilution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi .
european commission president romano prodi addressing the press said : " for the first time in history , europe will become one because unification is the free will of its people " .
europe 's people still have their say as to whether unification goes ahead in every country .
the candidate countries still face referendums at home and it is thought that this may prove a troublesome task in some states , especially poland .
poland 's position prompts cash injection and seals deal poland , the biggest of the 10 candidates and heavily dependent on agriculture , finally came on board after its demands for better terms sent the two-day summit into overtime .
its plea that polish farmers would face ruin without larger subsidies was appeased by half of the two billion euro that poland had asked for .
a referendum in poland may prove to be a difficult proposition for its pro-europe government .
poland 's leaders had to fight tooth and nail for a better deal for its millions of farmers but the people may demand more than the compromise offered and threaten to derail poland 's accession if they do n't get it .
but with everyone expected on board , europe 's leaders had every right to feel happy with their work .
eu honors the fall of the berlin wall - rasmussen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
" in 1989 , brave and visionary people tore down the berlin wall .
they would no longer tolerate the forced division of europe .
today we have delivered on their hopes , " said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , to the press .
" we decided to heal our continent .
we decided to create one europe .
welcome to our new family .
our new europe is born . "
it will be a considerably larger europe .
the eu 's population will rise by 75 million people after enlargement to more than 450 million - eclipsing the north american free trade area as the world 's biggest economic zone .
turkey the unhappy guests as talks scheduled for 2004 however , amid the initial congratulations , there were still some unhappy faces .
turkey grudgingly accepted an agreed delay to its own long-running membership drive with the eu pencilling in a date for accession talks for december 2004 .
turkey did agree to allow nato and the eu to forge a long-awaited military pact that will allow the union to launch its first-ever peacekeeping operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister abdullah gul .
the decision to delay turkey 's accession is a move that is unsatisfactory to the united states government , who were hoping turkey 's rapid inclusion would help shore up allies around the troubled middle east .
the decision , backed strongly by france and germany , also put britain in an awkward position and went against the pro-american ideas of the spanish and italian governments .
but the leaders confirmed that the eu 's enlargement process was " irreversible " and would eventually take in bulgaria , romania and turkey .
we will determine our own borders - prodi " our work is not yet finished , " romano prodi said in what could be construed as a disguised rebuff to the united states for its strident support for turkey 's eu bid .
" where the borders of europe lie is something the europeans must discuss and decide for themselves .
we must not accept that the borders of the union be imposed on us from outside , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides with turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash .
the image of european unity was not 100 percent achieved due to the failure of last-ditch un-brokered talks in copenhagen to end the 28-year division of cyprus .
both the greek and turkish cypriots were unable to bridge their differences and so the eu had no choice but to keep its promise to invite the internationally recognized greek-cypriot government alone .
deal aims to eradicate war in europe and heal divisions but the majority of the celebrations were well deserved .
the eu is now on a path to a five-decade drive towards " ever closer union " which began with a coal and steel community agreement back in 1951 .
this latest step is seen as a concerted effort to bind europe so close it can never go to war again and end the lingering cold war divisions .
in a final message of hope for the newly enlarged union , danish premier fogh rasmussen said , " today we have closed one of the bloodiest and darkest chapters in european history .
today we have opened a new chapter . "

the decision , backed strongly by france and germany , also put britain in an awkward position and went against the pro-american ideas of the spanish and italian governments .
but the leaders confirmed that the eu 's enlargement process was " irreversible " and would eventually take in bulgaria , romania and turkey .
we will determine our own borders - prodi " our work is not yet finished , " romano prodi said in what could be construed as a disguised rebuff to the united states for its strident support for turkey 's eu bid .
" where the borders of europe lie is something the europeans must discuss and decide for themselves .

the image of european unity was not 100 percent achieved due to the failure of last-ditch un-brokered talks in copenhagen to end the 28-year division of cyprus .
both the greek and turkish cypriots were unable to bridge their differences and so the eu had no choice but to keep its promise to invite the internationally recognized greek-cypriot government alone .
deal aims to eradicate war in europe and heal divisions but the majority of the celebrations were well deserved .
the eu is now on a path to a five-decade drive towards " ever closer union " which began with a coal and steel community agreement back in 1951 .
this latest step is seen as a concerted effort to bind europe so close it can never go to war again and end the lingering cold war divisions .
in a final message of hope for the newly enlarged union , danish premier fogh rasmussen said , " today we have closed one of the bloodiest and darkest chapters in european history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 14.12.2002 a new europe is born großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we are family : the eu agrees on expansion after doubts and debate , a new dawn breaks in europe with an agreement that will bring ten new countries , many from the formerly communist east , into the european union . two days of high pressure bargaining and dealing in copenhagen have culminated in the european union agreeing on an historic decision to expand eastwards and welcome ten new member , stretching the eu deep into ex-soviet territory and pushing its boundaries closer to the middle east .
at points during the discussions in the danish capital , it looked like there would be no groundbreaking moves with divisions setting members at odds .
the sticking points included the financial packages expected by the poorer newcomers , the question over future talks on turkey 's accession and the spilt membership problems of cyprus .
failure to reach a compromised on these subjects threatened to put the brakes on expansion .
eu invites the ten new members to join in may 2004 but in the late hours of friday night , to relieved and welcome celebration , a funding deal was finally struck and the 15-nation eu invited cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia to join the western members of the club in may 2004 .
the breakthrough came after germany , the eu 's traditional paymaster , said an extra one billion euro -lrb- $ 1.02bn -rrb- was on offer to appease the candidates despite the eu insisting for weeks that no more money would be forthcoming .
other nations also dug deep to grease the wheels of expansion .
" it is a great day for europe and also for germany , because one does n't go without the other , " german chancellor gerhard schroeder told a press conference , while warning that the eu 's expansion should not lead to its dilution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi .
european commission president romano prodi addressing the press said : " for the first time in history , europe will become one because unification is the free will of its people " .
europe 's people still have their say as to whether unification goes ahead in every country .
the candidate countries still face referendums at home and it is thought that this may prove a troublesome task in some states , especially poland .
poland 's position prompts cash injection and seals deal poland , the biggest of the 10 candidates and heavily dependent on agriculture , finally came on board after its demands for better terms sent the two-day summit into overtime .
its plea that polish farmers would face ruin without larger subsidies was appeased by half of the two billion euro that poland had asked for .
a referendum in poland may prove to be a difficult proposition for its pro-europe government .
poland 's leaders had to fight tooth and nail for a better deal for its millions of farmers but the people may demand more than the compromise offered and threaten to derail poland 's accession if they do n't get it .
but with everyone expected on board , europe 's leaders had every right to feel happy with their work .
eu honors the fall of the berlin wall - rasmussen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
" in 1989 , brave and visionary people tore down the berlin wall .
they would no longer tolerate the forced division of europe .
today we have delivered on their hopes , " said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , to the press .
" we decided to heal our continent .
we decided to create one europe .
welcome to our new family .
our new europe is born . "
it will be a considerably larger europe .
the eu 's population will rise by 75 million people after enlargement to more than 450 million - eclipsing the north american free trade area as the world 's biggest economic zone .
turkey the unhappy guests as talks scheduled for 2004 however , amid the initial congratulations , there were still some unhappy faces .
turkey grudgingly accepted an agreed delay to its own long-running membership drive with the eu pencilling in a date for accession talks for december 2004 .
turkey did agree to allow nato and the eu to forge a long-awaited military pact that will allow the union to launch its first-ever peacekeeping operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister abdullah gul .
the decision to delay turkey 's accession is a move that is unsatisfactory to the united states government , who were hoping turkey 's rapid inclusion would help shore up allies around the troubled middle east .
the decision , backed strongly by france and germany , also put britain in an awkward position and went against the pro-american ideas of the spanish and italian governments .

legal document suggests victim went to death willingly according to police reports bernd juergen b wrote out his will and had it officially recognized by a notary on the morning of his disappearance march 9 , 2001 .
in the will , he left the bulk of his estate including a lavish penthouse apartment and his collection of expensive computer equipment to his live-in partner , a man named rene .
the german daily berliner morgenpost reports that rene knew nothing of the victim 's plans and discovered the will only after bernd juergen b was reported missing .
the victim reportedly sold most of his other belongings , including a sports car just before his disappearance .
bernd juergen b had told his boss at siemens he was taking that friday off " to attend to some personal matters " .
he was last seen at a subway station in berlin when co-workers caught sight of him .
the german police believe the victim then traveled 300 kilometers from berlin to the alleged murderer 's rambling half-timbered house near kassel with several thousand euro in cash and his passport .
the 42-year-old victim , a computer chip developer at siemens corporation in berlin , willingly allowed himself to be led to the slaughter , police said .
evidence shows that both men consented to cannibalism " the victim appeared to be fully aware of the situation , " an investigator said .
" videotape material definitely shows both him and the suspect engaged in eating his own flesh prior to his death . "
police officers who have been studying the evidence , including the video made by the suspect of the final moments of his victim 's life , were said to be undergoing psychiatric counseling .
an official statement on friday said the video shows the victim willingly allowed himself to be castrated before both men engaged in eating his severed flesh .
after murdering the victim , the killer , only identified as armin m , apparently removed body parts for consumption and buried the rest .
during a search of the killer 's home , police found frozen human flesh and skeletal remains , and a cellar which had been renovated into a makeshift slaughterhouse , complete with trough drains and meat hooks .
police used diggers to unearth body parts on the grounds of armin m 's sprawling 17th century estate in the idyllic central german town of rotenburg an der fulda .
police have found no indications that more than one person 's remains had been disposed of on the estate .
adverts for willing victims led police to killer authorities filed murder charges against the reclusive computer systems expert on thursday .
the 41-year-old suspect admitted to investigators that he had videotaped himself killing the man who he had met via a gay internet chat room after the victim responded to one of 80 adverts that read : ' gay male seeks hunks 18-30 to slaughter . '
both men were computer experts and were both described as ' internet addicts ' by colleagues .
it was revealed on friday that a chat room user tipped police off to the existence of armin m 's grisly adverts .
investigators now know of at least five respondents to the ad , in addition to the undercover officers who answered it and quickly determined it was meant literally .
neighbors describe killer as ' a pleasant and polite man ' neighbors describe the murder suspect as a pleasant and polite man who kept to himself .
he served in the german armed forces as a non- commissioned officer in ordinance for 12 years where was described as an amiable and conscientious military man .
after leaving the military in 1991 , armin m trained as a computer technician and until recently had a job with a software firm in the rhine valley city of karlsruhe , 30km south of rotenburg .
he lived with his mother in the 17th century half-timbered manor house , staying on there after her death three years ago .
" he was a mama 's boy , " a neighbor told reporters .
" he was totally fixated on his mother , who he said never let him date girls .

at points during the discussions in the danish capital , it looked like there would be no groundbreaking moves with divisions setting members at odds .
the sticking points included the financial packages expected by the poorer newcomers , the question over future talks on turkey 's accession and the spilt membership problems of cyprus .
failure to reach a compromised on these subjects threatened to put the brakes on expansion .
eu invites the ten new members to join in may 2004 but in the late hours of friday night , to relieved and welcome celebration , a funding deal was finally struck and the 15-nation eu invited cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia to join the western members of the club in may 2004 .
the breakthrough came after germany , the eu 's traditional paymaster , said an extra one billion euro -lrb- $ 1.02bn -rrb- was on offer to appease the candidates despite the eu insisting for weeks that no more money would be forthcoming .
other nations also dug deep to grease the wheels of expansion .
" it is a great day for europe and also for germany , because one does n't go without the other , " german chancellor gerhard schroeder told a press conference , while warning that the eu 's expansion should not lead to its dilution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi .
european commission president romano prodi addressing the press said : " for the first time in history , europe will become one because unification is the free will of its people " .
europe 's people still have their say as to whether unification goes ahead in every country .
the candidate countries still face referendums at home and it is thought that this may prove a troublesome task in some states , especially poland .
poland 's position prompts cash injection and seals deal poland , the biggest of the 10 candidates and heavily dependent on agriculture , finally came on board after its demands for better terms sent the two-day summit into overtime .
its plea that polish farmers would face ruin without larger subsidies was appeased by half of the two billion euro that poland had asked for .
a referendum in poland may prove to be a difficult proposition for its pro-europe government .
poland 's leaders had to fight tooth and nail for a better deal for its millions of farmers but the people may demand more than the compromise offered and threaten to derail poland 's accession if they do n't get it .
but with everyone expected on board , europe 's leaders had every right to feel happy with their work .
eu honors the fall of the berlin wall - rasmussen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
" in 1989 , brave and visionary people tore down the berlin wall .
they would no longer tolerate the forced division of europe .
today we have delivered on their hopes , " said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , to the press .
" we decided to heal our continent .
we decided to create one europe .
welcome to our new family .
our new europe is born . "
it will be a considerably larger europe .
the eu 's population will rise by 75 million people after enlargement to more than 450 million - eclipsing the north american free trade area as the world 's biggest economic zone .
turkey the unhappy guests as talks scheduled for 2004 however , amid the initial congratulations , there were still some unhappy faces .
turkey grudgingly accepted an agreed delay to its own long-running membership drive with the eu pencilling in a date for accession talks for december 2004 .
turkey did agree to allow nato and the eu to forge a long-awaited military pact that will allow the union to launch its first-ever peacekeeping operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister abdullah gul .
the decision to delay turkey 's accession is a move that is unsatisfactory to the united states government , who were hoping turkey 's rapid inclusion would help shore up allies around the troubled middle east .
the decision , backed strongly by france and germany , also put britain in an awkward position and went against the pro-american ideas of the spanish and italian governments .
but the leaders confirmed that the eu 's enlargement process was " irreversible " and would eventually take in bulgaria , romania and turkey .
we will determine our own borders - prodi " our work is not yet finished , " romano prodi said in what could be construed as a disguised rebuff to the united states for its strident support for turkey 's eu bid .
" where the borders of europe lie is something the europeans must discuss and decide for themselves .
we must not accept that the borders of the union be imposed on us from outside , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides with turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash .
the image of european unity was not 100 percent achieved due to the failure of last-ditch un-brokered talks in copenhagen to end the 28-year division of cyprus .
both the greek and turkish cypriots were unable to bridge their differences and so the eu had no choice but to keep its promise to invite the internationally recognized greek-cypriot government alone .
deal aims to eradicate war in europe and heal divisions but the majority of the celebrations were well deserved .
the eu is now on a path to a five-decade drive towards " ever closer union " which began with a coal and steel community agreement back in 1951 .
this latest step is seen as a concerted effort to bind europe so close it can never go to war again and end the lingering cold war divisions .
in a final message of hope for the newly enlarged union , danish premier fogh rasmussen said , " today we have closed one of the bloodiest and darkest chapters in european history .
today we have opened a new chapter . "

the legal document and the video tape that is rumored to show both bernd juergen b and the perpetrator eating the victim 's flesh and the subsequent murder support suggestions that victim and killer both engaged in consensual cannibalism .

in the will , he left the bulk of his estate including a lavish penthouse apartment and his collection of expensive computer equipment to his live-in partner , a man named rene .

the legal document and the video tape that is rumored to show both bernd juergen b and the perpetrator eating the victim 's flesh and the subsequent murder support suggestions that victim and killer both engaged in consensual cannibalism .
legal document suggests victim went to death willingly according to police reports bernd juergen b wrote out his will and had it officially recognized by a notary on the morning of his disappearance march 9 , 2001 .
in the will , he left the bulk of his estate including a lavish penthouse apartment and his collection of expensive computer equipment to his live-in partner , a man named rene .
the german daily berliner morgenpost reports that rene knew nothing of the victim 's plans and discovered the will only after bernd juergen b was reported missing .
the victim reportedly sold most of his other belongings , including a sports car just before his disappearance .
bernd juergen b had told his boss at siemens he was taking that friday off " to attend to some personal matters " .
he was last seen at a subway station in berlin when co-workers caught sight of him .
the german police believe the victim then traveled 300 kilometers from berlin to the alleged murderer 's rambling half-timbered house near kassel with several thousand euro in cash and his passport .
the 42-year-old victim , a computer chip developer at siemens corporation in berlin , willingly allowed himself to be led to the slaughter , police said .
evidence shows that both men consented to cannibalism " the victim appeared to be fully aware of the situation , " an investigator said .
" videotape material definitely shows both him and the suspect engaged in eating his own flesh prior to his death . "
police officers who have been studying the evidence , including the video made by the suspect of the final moments of his victim 's life , were said to be undergoing psychiatric counseling .
an official statement on friday said the video shows the victim willingly allowed himself to be castrated before both men engaged in eating his severed flesh .
after murdering the victim , the killer , only identified as armin m , apparently removed body parts for consumption and buried the rest .
during a search of the killer 's home , police found frozen human flesh and skeletal remains , and a cellar which had been renovated into a makeshift slaughterhouse , complete with trough drains and meat hooks .
police used diggers to unearth body parts on the grounds of armin m 's sprawling 17th century estate in the idyllic central german town of rotenburg an der fulda .
police have found no indications that more than one person 's remains had been disposed of on the estate .
adverts for willing victims led police to killer authorities filed murder charges against the reclusive computer systems expert on thursday .
the 41-year-old suspect admitted to investigators that he had videotaped himself killing the man who he had met via a gay internet chat room after the victim responded to one of 80 adverts that read : ' gay male seeks hunks 18-30 to slaughter . '
both men were computer experts and were both described as ' internet addicts ' by colleagues .
it was revealed on friday that a chat room user tipped police off to the existence of armin m 's grisly adverts .
investigators now know of at least five respondents to the ad , in addition to the undercover officers who answered it and quickly determined it was meant literally .

at points during the discussions in the danish capital , it looked like there would be no groundbreaking moves with divisions setting members at odds .
the sticking points included the financial packages expected by the poorer newcomers , the question over future talks on turkey 's accession and the spilt membership problems of cyprus .
failure to reach a compromised on these subjects threatened to put the brakes on expansion .
eu invites the ten new members to join in may 2004 but in the late hours of friday night , to relieved and welcome celebration , a funding deal was finally struck and the 15-nation eu invited cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia to join the western members of the club in may 2004 .
the breakthrough came after germany , the eu 's traditional paymaster , said an extra one billion euro -lrb- $ 1.02bn -rrb- was on offer to appease the candidates despite the eu insisting for weeks that no more money would be forthcoming .
other nations also dug deep to grease the wheels of expansion .
" it is a great day for europe and also for germany , because one does n't go without the other , " german chancellor gerhard schroeder told a press conference , while warning that the eu 's expansion should not lead to its dilution .

european commission president romano prodi addressing the press said : " for the first time in history , europe will become one because unification is the free will of its people " .
europe 's people still have their say as to whether unification goes ahead in every country .
the candidate countries still face referendums at home and it is thought that this may prove a troublesome task in some states , especially poland .
poland 's position prompts cash injection and seals deal poland , the biggest of the 10 candidates and heavily dependent on agriculture , finally came on board after its demands for better terms sent the two-day summit into overtime .
its plea that polish farmers would face ruin without larger subsidies was appeased by half of the two billion euro that poland had asked for .
a referendum in poland may prove to be a difficult proposition for its pro-europe government .
poland 's leaders had to fight tooth and nail for a better deal for its millions of farmers but the people may demand more than the compromise offered and threaten to derail poland 's accession if they do n't get it .
but with everyone expected on board , europe 's leaders had every right to feel happy with their work .

today we have delivered on their hopes , " said danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , to the press .
" we decided to heal our continent .

turkey the unhappy guests as talks scheduled for 2004 however , amid the initial congratulations , there were still some unhappy faces .
turkey grudgingly accepted an agreed delay to its own long-running membership drive with the eu pencilling in a date for accession talks for december 2004 .
turkey did agree to allow nato and the eu to forge a long-awaited military pact that will allow the union to launch its first-ever peacekeeping operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister abdullah gul .
the decision to delay turkey 's accession is a move that is unsatisfactory to the united states government , who were hoping turkey 's rapid inclusion would help shore up allies around the troubled middle east .
the decision , backed strongly by france and germany , also put britain in an awkward position and went against the pro-american ideas of the spanish and italian governments .

legal document suggests victim went to death willingly according to police reports bernd juergen b wrote out his will and had it officially recognized by a notary on the morning of his disappearance march 9 , 2001 .
in the will , he left the bulk of his estate including a lavish penthouse apartment and his collection of expensive computer equipment to his live-in partner , a man named rene .
the german daily berliner morgenpost reports that rene knew nothing of the victim 's plans and discovered the will only after bernd juergen b was reported missing .
the victim reportedly sold most of his other belongings , including a sports car just before his disappearance .
bernd juergen b had told his boss at siemens he was taking that friday off " to attend to some personal matters " .
he was last seen at a subway station in berlin when co-workers caught sight of him .
the german police believe the victim then traveled 300 kilometers from berlin to the alleged murderer 's rambling half-timbered house near kassel with several thousand euro in cash and his passport .
the 42-year-old victim , a computer chip developer at siemens corporation in berlin , willingly allowed himself to be led to the slaughter , police said .
evidence shows that both men consented to cannibalism " the victim appeared to be fully aware of the situation , " an investigator said .
" videotape material definitely shows both him and the suspect engaged in eating his own flesh prior to his death . "
police officers who have been studying the evidence , including the video made by the suspect of the final moments of his victim 's life , were said to be undergoing psychiatric counseling .
an official statement on friday said the video shows the victim willingly allowed himself to be castrated before both men engaged in eating his severed flesh .
after murdering the victim , the killer , only identified as armin m , apparently removed body parts for consumption and buried the rest .
during a search of the killer 's home , police found frozen human flesh and skeletal remains , and a cellar which had been renovated into a makeshift slaughterhouse , complete with trough drains and meat hooks .
police used diggers to unearth body parts on the grounds of armin m 's sprawling 17th century estate in the idyllic central german town of rotenburg an der fulda .
police have found no indications that more than one person 's remains had been disposed of on the estate .
adverts for willing victims led police to killer authorities filed murder charges against the reclusive computer systems expert on thursday .
the 41-year-old suspect admitted to investigators that he had videotaped himself killing the man who he had met via a gay internet chat room after the victim responded to one of 80 adverts that read : ' gay male seeks hunks 18-30 to slaughter . '
both men were computer experts and were both described as ' internet addicts ' by colleagues .
it was revealed on friday that a chat room user tipped police off to the existence of armin m 's grisly adverts .
investigators now know of at least five respondents to the ad , in addition to the undercover officers who answered it and quickly determined it was meant literally .
neighbors describe killer as ' a pleasant and polite man ' neighbors describe the murder suspect as a pleasant and polite man who kept to himself .
he served in the german armed forces as a non- commissioned officer in ordinance for 12 years where was described as an amiable and conscientious military man .
after leaving the military in 1991 , armin m trained as a computer technician and until recently had a job with a software firm in the rhine valley city of karlsruhe , 30km south of rotenburg .
he lived with his mother in the 17th century half-timbered manor house , staying on there after her death three years ago .
" he was a mama 's boy , " a neighbor told reporters .
" he was totally fixated on his mother , who he said never let him date girls .
after she died , he began to thaw out . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german police investigate alleged cannibal murder germans woke up on thursday to the traumatic news that a man had killed and eaten another man with the victim 's approval .

the legal document and the video tape that is rumored to show both bernd juergen b and the perpetrator eating the victim 's flesh and the subsequent murder support suggestions that victim and killer both engaged in consensual cannibalism .
legal document suggests victim went to death willingly according to police reports bernd juergen b wrote out his will and had it officially recognized by a notary on the morning of his disappearance march 9 , 2001 .
in the will , he left the bulk of his estate including a lavish penthouse apartment and his collection of expensive computer equipment to his live-in partner , a man named rene .
the german daily berliner morgenpost reports that rene knew nothing of the victim 's plans and discovered the will only after bernd juergen b was reported missing .
the victim reportedly sold most of his other belongings , including a sports car just before his disappearance .
bernd juergen b had told his boss at siemens he was taking that friday off " to attend to some personal matters " .
he was last seen at a subway station in berlin when co-workers caught sight of him .
the german police believe the victim then traveled 300 kilometers from berlin to the alleged murderer 's rambling half-timbered house near kassel with several thousand euro in cash and his passport .
the 42-year-old victim , a computer chip developer at siemens corporation in berlin , willingly allowed himself to be led to the slaughter , police said .
evidence shows that both men consented to cannibalism " the victim appeared to be fully aware of the situation , " an investigator said .
" videotape material definitely shows both him and the suspect engaged in eating his own flesh prior to his death . "
police officers who have been studying the evidence , including the video made by the suspect of the final moments of his victim 's life , were said to be undergoing psychiatric counseling .
an official statement on friday said the video shows the victim willingly allowed himself to be castrated before both men engaged in eating his severed flesh .
after murdering the victim , the killer , only identified as armin m , apparently removed body parts for consumption and buried the rest .
during a search of the killer 's home , police found frozen human flesh and skeletal remains , and a cellar which had been renovated into a makeshift slaughterhouse , complete with trough drains and meat hooks .
police used diggers to unearth body parts on the grounds of armin m 's sprawling 17th century estate in the idyllic central german town of rotenburg an der fulda .
police have found no indications that more than one person 's remains had been disposed of on the estate .
adverts for willing victims led police to killer authorities filed murder charges against the reclusive computer systems expert on thursday .
the 41-year-old suspect admitted to investigators that he had videotaped himself killing the man who he had met via a gay internet chat room after the victim responded to one of 80 adverts that read : ' gay male seeks hunks 18-30 to slaughter . '
both men were computer experts and were both described as ' internet addicts ' by colleagues .
it was revealed on friday that a chat room user tipped police off to the existence of armin m 's grisly adverts .
investigators now know of at least five respondents to the ad , in addition to the undercover officers who answered it and quickly determined it was meant literally .
neighbors describe killer as ' a pleasant and polite man ' neighbors describe the murder suspect as a pleasant and polite man who kept to himself .
he served in the german armed forces as a non- commissioned officer in ordinance for 12 years where was described as an amiable and conscientious military man .
after leaving the military in 1991 , armin m trained as a computer technician and until recently had a job with a software firm in the rhine valley city of karlsruhe , 30km south of rotenburg .
he lived with his mother in the 17th century half-timbered manor house , staying on there after her death three years ago .

the sticking points included the financial packages expected by the poorer newcomers , the question over future talks on turkey 's accession and the spilt membership problems of cyprus .
failure to reach a compromised on these subjects threatened to put the brakes on expansion .
eu invites the ten new members to join in may 2004 but in the late hours of friday night , to relieved and welcome celebration , a funding deal was finally struck and the 15-nation eu invited cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovenia and slovakia to join the western members of the club in may 2004 .
the breakthrough came after germany , the eu 's traditional paymaster , said an extra one billion euro -lrb- $ 1.02bn -rrb- was on offer to appease the candidates despite the eu insisting for weeks that no more money would be forthcoming .

european commission president romano prodi addressing the press said : " for the first time in history , europe will become one because unification is the free will of its people " .
europe 's people still have their say as to whether unification goes ahead in every country .
the candidate countries still face referendums at home and it is thought that this may prove a troublesome task in some states , especially poland .

its plea that polish farmers would face ruin without larger subsidies was appeased by half of the two billion euro that poland had asked for .
a referendum in poland may prove to be a difficult proposition for its pro-europe government .
poland 's leaders had to fight tooth and nail for a better deal for its millions of farmers but the people may demand more than the compromise offered and threaten to derail poland 's accession if they do n't get it .

turkey the unhappy guests as talks scheduled for 2004 however , amid the initial congratulations , there were still some unhappy faces .
turkey grudgingly accepted an agreed delay to its own long-running membership drive with the eu pencilling in a date for accession talks for december 2004 .
turkey did agree to allow nato and the eu to forge a long-awaited military pact that will allow the union to launch its first-ever peacekeeping operations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister abdullah gul .
the decision to delay turkey 's accession is a move that is unsatisfactory to the united states government , who were hoping turkey 's rapid inclusion would help shore up allies around the troubled middle east .
the decision , backed strongly by france and germany , also put britain in an awkward position and went against the pro-american ideas of the spanish and italian governments .

the legal document and the video tape that is rumored to show both bernd juergen b and the perpetrator eating the victim 's flesh and the subsequent murder support suggestions that victim and killer both engaged in consensual cannibalism .
legal document suggests victim went to death willingly according to police reports bernd juergen b wrote out his will and had it officially recognized by a notary on the morning of his disappearance march 9 , 2001 .
in the will , he left the bulk of his estate including a lavish penthouse apartment and his collection of expensive computer equipment to his live-in partner , a man named rene .
the german daily berliner morgenpost reports that rene knew nothing of the victim 's plans and discovered the will only after bernd juergen b was reported missing .
the victim reportedly sold most of his other belongings , including a sports car just before his disappearance .
bernd juergen b had told his boss at siemens he was taking that friday off " to attend to some personal matters " .
he was last seen at a subway station in berlin when co-workers caught sight of him .
the german police believe the victim then traveled 300 kilometers from berlin to the alleged murderer 's rambling half-timbered house near kassel with several thousand euro in cash and his passport .
the 42-year-old victim , a computer chip developer at siemens corporation in berlin , willingly allowed himself to be led to the slaughter , police said .

an official statement on friday said the video shows the victim willingly allowed himself to be castrated before both men engaged in eating his severed flesh .
after murdering the victim , the killer , only identified as armin m , apparently removed body parts for consumption and buried the rest .
during a search of the killer 's home , police found frozen human flesh and skeletal remains , and a cellar which had been renovated into a makeshift slaughterhouse , complete with trough drains and meat hooks .
police used diggers to unearth body parts on the grounds of armin m 's sprawling 17th century estate in the idyllic central german town of rotenburg an der fulda .
police have found no indications that more than one person 's remains had been disposed of on the estate .
adverts for willing victims led police to killer authorities filed murder charges against the reclusive computer systems expert on thursday .
the 41-year-old suspect admitted to investigators that he had videotaped himself killing the man who he had met via a gay internet chat room after the victim responded to one of 80 adverts that read : ' gay male seeks hunks 18-30 to slaughter . '
both men were computer experts and were both described as ' internet addicts ' by colleagues .
it was revealed on friday that a chat room user tipped police off to the existence of armin m 's grisly adverts .
investigators now know of at least five respondents to the ad , in addition to the undercover officers who answered it and quickly determined it was meant literally .

six men from glasgow , aged between 37 and 51 , were arrested for criminal damage , public disorder and assault .
superintendent colin jones said further arrests could not be ruled out , and some people could be charged with more serious offences under the aviation act .
cabin crew were shocked and tearful when he met them , he said .
" i have seen the cabin crew and they were extremely traumatised , of that there is no doubt , " he said .
" my conjecture is that there was a serious incident on board that aircraft . "
' out of proportion ' he said there had been a " certain amount of damage " to the plane , and the incident must have been " shocking and frightening " .
there was a discussion between one of the passengers and the cabin crew - it was a little bit heated but not too bad passenger steve prince he said although he did not know for sure how many fans had been involved in the trouble , he was confident the " main protagonists " were in custody .
but one fan said the incident had been " blown out of proportion " .
according to passenger steve prince , the problem only began when the pilot told passengers they would be detained on the runway at glasgow .
" after that , there was a discussion between one of the passengers and the cabin crew - it was a little bit heated but not too bad .
" one of the passengers leaned over and tapped one of the cabin crew on the shoulder .
" the next thing , we were descending at a rapid rate and heading to cardiff .
" i 'm a little surprised to hear there had been a riot on board .
there were not any fierce postures taken . "
club ban but astraeus said the captain had made " absolutely the right decision " in diverting to cardiff .
armed police met fans coming off the plane " unruliness on the ground is one thing , but any sort of disturbance at altitude in a passenger aircraft is an extremely serious matter , " it said .
celtic football club said any fans convicted would be banned from future international travel and the club 's ground .
" these individuals will have clearly undermined the reputation of the celtic support .
such action will not be tolerated by celtic , " said chief executive ian mcleod .
the fans not detained by police were put on a bus to complete their journey to glasgow , and were due to arrive later on saturday morning . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's bob sinkinson " there could be further repercussions " simon calder , the independent " this was n't just a normal diversion " steve prince , passenger " there was no alcohol whatsoever " more news on this club see also : 13 dec 02 -pipe- wales celtic fans ' plane in emergency landing 28 jun 02 -pipe- england ' air rage ' woman jailed 05 jul 01 -pipe- uk airlines ' ignore air rage ' 23 jul 01 -pipe- trouble in the air controlling cabin fever internet links : astraeus cardiff international airport south wales police the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top wales stories now : boyfriend sought in murder inquiry girl will wait for jailed ' rapist ' lover cash boost for brecon jazz hello !

turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan , meanwhile , has sought to play down his government 's disappointment over the fact that it will not be allowed to begin talks on entering the eu until 2004 .
turkey had been pressing for an immediate start to its negotiations on joining the eu .
it has been kept waiting for decades because of its poor human rights record , but the newly-elected government believes a recent rush of new legislation means it deserves to begin talks soon .
despite failing to clinch an earlier start date for entry talks , turkey has nonetheless lifted its opposition to a long-delayed arrangement for nato to assist the eu 's embryonic rapid reaction force .
the accord had been held up for about two years .
under the deal , eu can draw on nato 's assets and planning for the 60,000-strong force .

our science editor , dr david whitehouse , explains why it is time to go back it inspired a generation to become involved in engineering and that fertilised american industry : microelectronics , computers , avionics and advanced materials all benefited from the lunar programme. whoever controls the moon 's oxygen will control the solar system years later president bush said that apollo was the best return on an investment since leonardo da vinci bought a sketchpad .
but apollo , more than any other space project , showed us where we live in the universe and started a global ecological awareness that lives today .
and , of course , apollo also gave us the moon . : apollo 17 the last men to walk on the moon apollo 's challenge to the future cosmic chronicle thanks to the study of the moonrocks brought back by apollo , we now know that the moon was born in just fifteen minutes .
cernan , evans and schmitt challenged humanity to go back to the moon billions of years ago the primordial earth , with perhaps the first flickering of life on its seared surface , was struck by a planetary body the size of mars .
within seconds this titanic collision squirted molten and vaporised rock into space .
much of it escaped to become debris orbiting in between the planets but some remained in orbit around earth and collapsed into a ball that became our moon .
night-times on earth were never the same again .
rock collection the moon , being small , rapidly lost its internal heat and was volcanically active for only a short part of its life .
the apollo 17 lunar module lifted off from the moon at 2254 gmt with a surface largely unchanged for billions of years , it is a four-and-a-half-billion-year-old chronicle recording the history of our solar system .
thanks to apollo , we know more about the moon than we do about any other object in space with the exception of our own planet .
we have about 2,000 samples from nine sites , 382 kg from six apollo landings as well as 0.3 kg from three soviet automated sample return probes .
the surface has also been examined at 10 additional sites by other probes .
first moonbase returning to the moon will be very different from what it was the first time around .
but it is the only way to get the public interested in space again .
cernan and schmitt spent more than 22 hours walking on the moon the space shuttle does not go anywhere except round in circles , the space station is worthy but dull and , a trip to mars is just too expensive .
to capture the public 's imagination it just has to be a trip to the moon .
the science possible on the moon is astounding .
it has low gravity , no magnetic field , no atmosphere , no water , high vacuum , low or high temperature depending upon whether you are in shadow or not , seismic stability , no radio interference on its far side and total , total sterility .
to build the first moonbase we need take nothing with us except our ingenuity .
future profits there is in the lunar rocks everything required for supporting life , and many profitable industries , too .
the rocket fuel - in the form of oxygen and hydrogen - mined from lunar dirt could open up the solar system .
because the moon 's gravity is much lower than that on the earth it requires far less energy to mine and ship rocket fuel from the moon to earth orbit than it does to get it up from the earth .
in fact , it requires far less energy to send rocket fuel from the moon to mars than it does to get it from the earth 's surface into earth orbit .
the moon 's land area is about the same as the area of africa .
it is just as rich in minerals and in the future it will make fortunes for as many , just as africa did .
in 100 years ' time , the lunox corporation could be one of the biggest companies on or off the earth because whoever controls the moon 's oxygen will control the solar system .
