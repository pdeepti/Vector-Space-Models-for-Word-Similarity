george w. bush wrapped up a two-day visit to paris with a solemn visit to the d-day beaches at normandy . under overcast skies , us president george w. bush paid a solemn visit to the d-day cemetery at normandy on monday , following talks with french president jacques chirac on tensions in the us-europe relationship .

i mean , i 'm in a democracy .
i 'm travelling to a country that respects other people 's points of view .
but i feel very comfortable coming to europe .
i feel very comfortable coming to france .
i 've got a lot of friends here . "

the european globalization-critical group attac has become a leading voice against neo-liberal economic policies .
a member of attac 's leadership spoke with dw-world on the direction the group is taking . at any protest against the world bank or the international monetary fund these days , members of attac will almost certainly be on the front lines .
the group , formed in france in 1998 , has become one of the leading critics of the neo-liberal economics of globalization striking a chord with thousands across europe .
" people are concerned these days about social justice , environmental problems and democracy in the process of globalization , " said sven giegold , a member of attac ’ s steering committee .
he insists that attac is not " antiglobalization " as such , but rather critical of the economic side of the process .
" while markets are integrating globally , democracy is still based on nation-states , " giegold said in a dw-world interview .
" that means the possibility of democracies to regulate for social security and environmental protection is limited . "
unexpected level of success attac quickly spread beyond france ’ s borders and now has branches in forty countries .
in germany , where the group formed two years ago , its membership has grown exponentially , jumping from 400 members last year to 6,500 today .
membership skyrocketed particularly after the g8 protests in genoa last july . -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after such a dizzying climb , the german branch of the organization met in frankfurt / main over the weekend to take stock and to consider where to go from here .
the participants in the lecture hall at the university of frankfurt ranged from the vociferous students who are those most visible during anti-globalization demonstrations , to older women well into middle age , their husbands wearing their grey , thinning hair pulled back into ponytails .
" there are quite a lot of people from the ‘ 68 movement who have left their armchairs and are getting back to work , " said giegold , referring to the widespread student protest wave thirty-four years ago .
the challenge , according to giegold , is to keep the movement focused on its core issue , the economics of globalization , and resist the pressure to dilute that message .
that is proving difficult , he says , since as membership grows , people bring a whole variety of ideas with them about how attac should try to change the status quo .
" we are not a group with just one ' – ism ' behind it , so there is definitely a danger there , " giegold said .
" we have to be careful that we don ’ t demand everything in trying to make the world a better place , " above the political fray part of staying true to that core idea is staying out of politics .
although attac is making a name for itself as a vocal critic of globalization and even attracting the attention of mainstream politicians fo late , it still has no political aspirations , according to giegold .
he denied any comparisons to germany ’ s green party , a vocal , grassroots protest movement in the late 1970s that eventually went on to hold real political power .
in fact , attac has become one of the green ’ s most vociferous critics , accusing the party of betraying its core principles in exchange for political success .
attac sees itself as being closer to organizations along the lines of greenpeace or friends of the earth , non-governmental movements whose members might well also be members of established political parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for attac to remain uncorrupted and effective , it has to stay on message , giegold said .

the european globalization-critical group attac has become a leading voice against neo-liberal economic policies .
a member of attac 's leadership spoke with dw-world on the direction the group is taking . at any protest against the world bank or the international monetary fund these days , members of attac will almost certainly be on the front lines .
the group , formed in france in 1998 , has become one of the leading critics of the neo-liberal economics of globalization striking a chord with thousands across europe .
" people are concerned these days about social justice , environmental problems and democracy in the process of globalization , " said sven giegold , a member of attac ’ s steering committee .
he insists that attac is not " antiglobalization " as such , but rather critical of the economic side of the process .
" while markets are integrating globally , democracy is still based on nation-states , " giegold said in a dw-world interview .
" that means the possibility of democracies to regulate for social security and environmental protection is limited . "
unexpected level of success attac quickly spread beyond france ’ s borders and now has branches in forty countries .
in germany , where the group formed two years ago , its membership has grown exponentially , jumping from 400 members last year to 6,500 today .
membership skyrocketed particularly after the g8 protests in genoa last july . -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after such a dizzying climb , the german branch of the organization met in frankfurt / main over the weekend to take stock and to consider where to go from here .
the participants in the lecture hall at the university of frankfurt ranged from the vociferous students who are those most visible during anti-globalization demonstrations , to older women well into middle age , their husbands wearing their grey , thinning hair pulled back into ponytails .
" there are quite a lot of people from the ‘ 68 movement who have left their armchairs and are getting back to work , " said giegold , referring to the widespread student protest wave thirty-four years ago .
the challenge , according to giegold , is to keep the movement focused on its core issue , the economics of globalization , and resist the pressure to dilute that message .
that is proving difficult , he says , since as membership grows , people bring a whole variety of ideas with them about how attac should try to change the status quo .
" we are not a group with just one ' – ism ' behind it , so there is definitely a danger there , " giegold said .
" we have to be careful that we don ’ t demand everything in trying to make the world a better place , " above the political fray part of staying true to that core idea is staying out of politics .
although attac is making a name for itself as a vocal critic of globalization and even attracting the attention of mainstream politicians fo late , it still has no political aspirations , according to giegold .
he denied any comparisons to germany ’ s green party , a vocal , grassroots protest movement in the late 1970s that eventually went on to hold real political power .
in fact , attac has become one of the green ’ s most vociferous critics , accusing the party of betraying its core principles in exchange for political success .
attac sees itself as being closer to organizations along the lines of greenpeace or friends of the earth , non-governmental movements whose members might well also be members of established political parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for attac to remain uncorrupted and effective , it has to stay on message , giegold said .

" i am honoured and moved to receive this prestigious prize for a film which represents poland " , polanski said .
the film is said to be very personal .
polanski , 68 , himself a jew , survived the krakow ghetto but lost his mother in a nazi concentration camp .
it is the first time that polanski , director of classics such as chinatown , repulsion and rosemary ’ s baby has received the palme d ’ or .
finnland ’ s kati outinen won the award for her performance as a salvation army officer in the man without a past .
belgium ’ s olivier gourmet took the award for best actor in le fils -lrb- the son -rrb- .
pomp and politics despite the usual glitz and glamour , this year ’ s film festival was one with a difference .
a large number of films focused on current politics .
two films up for the golden palm drew attention to the growing violence between israelis and palestinians .
in addition , the whole festival was thrown into the political spotlight just a few days before the opening when the american jewish congress -lrb- ajc -rrb- called for its members to boycott the event .
calling for people in the entertainment business to think carefully about going to cannes , the ajc appealed to them to raise the issue of anti-semitism whenever they could .
ajc president jack rosen insisted that his organization was not calling for a general boycott of france , but rather wanted to increase awareness for what he saw as growing anti-semitism in the country , referring to the attacks on jewish institutions in previous months following tensions in the middle east as well may ’ s rise of one-time presidential contender jean-marie le pen .
the matter led to public dispute , as leading figures in the french jewish community spoke out against the ajc ’ s call for a boycott , saying the french government had publicly condemmed any anti-semitic violence .

" i am honoured and moved to receive this prestigious prize for a film which represents poland " , polanski said .
the film is said to be very personal .
polanski , 68 , himself a jew , survived the krakow ghetto but lost his mother in a nazi concentration camp .
it is the first time that polanski , director of classics such as chinatown , repulsion and rosemary ’ s baby has received the palme d ’ or .

pomp and politics despite the usual glitz and glamour , this year ’ s film festival was one with a difference .
a large number of films focused on current politics .
two films up for the golden palm drew attention to the growing violence between israelis and palestinians .
in addition , the whole festival was thrown into the political spotlight just a few days before the opening when the american jewish congress -lrb- ajc -rrb- called for its members to boycott the event .
calling for people in the entertainment business to think carefully about going to cannes , the ajc appealed to them to raise the issue of anti-semitism whenever they could .
ajc president jack rosen insisted that his organization was not calling for a general boycott of france , but rather wanted to increase awareness for what he saw as growing anti-semitism in the country , referring to the attacks on jewish institutions in previous months following tensions in the middle east as well may ’ s rise of one-time presidential contender jean-marie le pen .
the matter led to public dispute , as leading figures in the french jewish community spoke out against the ajc ’ s call for a boycott , saying the french government had publicly condemmed any anti-semitic violence .

the european globalization-critical group attac has become a leading voice against neo-liberal economic policies .
a member of attac 's leadership spoke with dw-world on the direction the group is taking . at any protest against the world bank or the international monetary fund these days , members of attac will almost certainly be on the front lines .
the group , formed in france in 1998 , has become one of the leading critics of the neo-liberal economics of globalization striking a chord with thousands across europe .
" people are concerned these days about social justice , environmental problems and democracy in the process of globalization , " said sven giegold , a member of attac ’ s steering committee .
he insists that attac is not " antiglobalization " as such , but rather critical of the economic side of the process .
" while markets are integrating globally , democracy is still based on nation-states , " giegold said in a dw-world interview .
" that means the possibility of democracies to regulate for social security and environmental protection is limited . "
unexpected level of success attac quickly spread beyond france ’ s borders and now has branches in forty countries .

the participants in the lecture hall at the university of frankfurt ranged from the vociferous students who are those most visible during anti-globalization demonstrations , to older women well into middle age , their husbands wearing their grey , thinning hair pulled back into ponytails .
" there are quite a lot of people from the ‘ 68 movement who have left their armchairs and are getting back to work , " said giegold , referring to the widespread student protest wave thirty-four years ago .
the challenge , according to giegold , is to keep the movement focused on its core issue , the economics of globalization , and resist the pressure to dilute that message .
that is proving difficult , he says , since as membership grows , people bring a whole variety of ideas with them about how attac should try to change the status quo .
" we are not a group with just one ' – ism ' behind it , so there is definitely a danger there , " giegold said .
" we have to be careful that we don ’ t demand everything in trying to make the world a better place , " above the political fray part of staying true to that core idea is staying out of politics .
although attac is making a name for itself as a vocal critic of globalization and even attracting the attention of mainstream politicians fo late , it still has no political aspirations , according to giegold .
he denied any comparisons to germany ’ s green party , a vocal , grassroots protest movement in the late 1970s that eventually went on to hold real political power .
in fact , attac has become one of the green ’ s most vociferous critics , accusing the party of betraying its core principles in exchange for political success .
attac sees itself as being closer to organizations along the lines of greenpeace or friends of the earth , non-governmental movements whose members might well also be members of established political parties .

" we have to be careful that we don ’ t demand everything in trying to make the world a better place , " above the political fray part of staying true to that core idea is staying out of politics .
although attac is making a name for itself as a vocal critic of globalization and even attracting the attention of mainstream politicians fo late , it still has no political aspirations , according to giegold .
he denied any comparisons to germany ’ s green party , a vocal , grassroots protest movement in the late 1970s that eventually went on to hold real political power .
in fact , attac has become one of the green ’ s most vociferous critics , accusing the party of betraying its core principles in exchange for political success .
attac sees itself as being closer to organizations along the lines of greenpeace or friends of the earth , non-governmental movements whose members might well also be members of established political parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for attac to remain uncorrupted and effective , it has to stay on message , giegold said .

the european globalization-critical group attac has become a leading voice against neo-liberal economic policies .
a member of attac 's leadership spoke with dw-world on the direction the group is taking . at any protest against the world bank or the international monetary fund these days , members of attac will almost certainly be on the front lines .
the group , formed in france in 1998 , has become one of the leading critics of the neo-liberal economics of globalization striking a chord with thousands across europe .
" people are concerned these days about social justice , environmental problems and democracy in the process of globalization , " said sven giegold , a member of attac ’ s steering committee .
he insists that attac is not " antiglobalization " as such , but rather critical of the economic side of the process .
" while markets are integrating globally , democracy is still based on nation-states , " giegold said in a dw-world interview .
" that means the possibility of democracies to regulate for social security and environmental protection is limited . "
unexpected level of success attac quickly spread beyond france ’ s borders and now has branches in forty countries .
in germany , where the group formed two years ago , its membership has grown exponentially , jumping from 400 members last year to 6,500 today .
membership skyrocketed particularly after the g8 protests in genoa last july . -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after such a dizzying climb , the german branch of the organization met in frankfurt / main over the weekend to take stock and to consider where to go from here .
the participants in the lecture hall at the university of frankfurt ranged from the vociferous students who are those most visible during anti-globalization demonstrations , to older women well into middle age , their husbands wearing their grey , thinning hair pulled back into ponytails .
" there are quite a lot of people from the ‘ 68 movement who have left their armchairs and are getting back to work , " said giegold , referring to the widespread student protest wave thirty-four years ago .
the challenge , according to giegold , is to keep the movement focused on its core issue , the economics of globalization , and resist the pressure to dilute that message .
that is proving difficult , he says , since as membership grows , people bring a whole variety of ideas with them about how attac should try to change the status quo .
" we are not a group with just one ' – ism ' behind it , so there is definitely a danger there , " giegold said .
" we have to be careful that we don ’ t demand everything in trying to make the world a better place , " above the political fray part of staying true to that core idea is staying out of politics .

the european globalization-critical group attac has become a leading voice against neo-liberal economic policies .
a member of attac 's leadership spoke with dw-world on the direction the group is taking . at any protest against the world bank or the international monetary fund these days , members of attac will almost certainly be on the front lines .
the group , formed in france in 1998 , has become one of the leading critics of the neo-liberal economics of globalization striking a chord with thousands across europe .
" people are concerned these days about social justice , environmental problems and democracy in the process of globalization , " said sven giegold , a member of attac ’ s steering committee .
he insists that attac is not " antiglobalization " as such , but rather critical of the economic side of the process .
" while markets are integrating globally , democracy is still based on nation-states , " giegold said in a dw-world interview .
" that means the possibility of democracies to regulate for social security and environmental protection is limited . "
unexpected level of success attac quickly spread beyond france ’ s borders and now has branches in forty countries .
in germany , where the group formed two years ago , its membership has grown exponentially , jumping from 400 members last year to 6,500 today .
membership skyrocketed particularly after the g8 protests in genoa last july . -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after such a dizzying climb , the german branch of the organization met in frankfurt / main over the weekend to take stock and to consider where to go from here .
the participants in the lecture hall at the university of frankfurt ranged from the vociferous students who are those most visible during anti-globalization demonstrations , to older women well into middle age , their husbands wearing their grey , thinning hair pulled back into ponytails .
" there are quite a lot of people from the ‘ 68 movement who have left their armchairs and are getting back to work , " said giegold , referring to the widespread student protest wave thirty-four years ago .
the challenge , according to giegold , is to keep the movement focused on its core issue , the economics of globalization , and resist the pressure to dilute that message .
that is proving difficult , he says , since as membership grows , people bring a whole variety of ideas with them about how attac should try to change the status quo .
" we are not a group with just one ' – ism ' behind it , so there is definitely a danger there , " giegold said .
" we have to be careful that we don ’ t demand everything in trying to make the world a better place , " above the political fray part of staying true to that core idea is staying out of politics .
although attac is making a name for itself as a vocal critic of globalization and even attracting the attention of mainstream politicians fo late , it still has no political aspirations , according to giegold .
he denied any comparisons to germany ’ s green party , a vocal , grassroots protest movement in the late 1970s that eventually went on to hold real political power .
in fact , attac has become one of the green ’ s most vociferous critics , accusing the party of betraying its core principles in exchange for political success .
attac sees itself as being closer to organizations along the lines of greenpeace or friends of the earth , non-governmental movements whose members might well also be members of established political parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for attac to remain uncorrupted and effective , it has to stay on message , giegold said .
" even if attac is very sexy at the moment , we shouldn ’ t go into the center of the peace or environmental movement , " giegold said .

the film is said to be very personal .

pomp and politics despite the usual glitz and glamour , this year ’ s film festival was one with a difference .
a large number of films focused on current politics .
two films up for the golden palm drew attention to the growing violence between israelis and palestinians .
in addition , the whole festival was thrown into the political spotlight just a few days before the opening when the american jewish congress -lrb- ajc -rrb- called for its members to boycott the event .
calling for people in the entertainment business to think carefully about going to cannes , the ajc appealed to them to raise the issue of anti-semitism whenever they could .
ajc president jack rosen insisted that his organization was not calling for a general boycott of france , but rather wanted to increase awareness for what he saw as growing anti-semitism in the country , referring to the attacks on jewish institutions in previous months following tensions in the middle east as well may ’ s rise of one-time presidential contender jean-marie le pen .
the matter led to public dispute , as leading figures in the french jewish community spoke out against the ajc ’ s call for a boycott , saying the french government had publicly condemmed any anti-semitic violence .

calling for people in the entertainment business to think carefully about going to cannes , the ajc appealed to them to raise the issue of anti-semitism whenever they could .
ajc president jack rosen insisted that his organization was not calling for a general boycott of france , but rather wanted to increase awareness for what he saw as growing anti-semitism in the country , referring to the attacks on jewish institutions in previous months following tensions in the middle east as well may ’ s rise of one-time presidential contender jean-marie le pen .

the european globalization-critical group attac has become a leading voice against neo-liberal economic policies .
a member of attac 's leadership spoke with dw-world on the direction the group is taking . at any protest against the world bank or the international monetary fund these days , members of attac will almost certainly be on the front lines .
the group , formed in france in 1998 , has become one of the leading critics of the neo-liberal economics of globalization striking a chord with thousands across europe .
" people are concerned these days about social justice , environmental problems and democracy in the process of globalization , " said sven giegold , a member of attac ’ s steering committee .
he insists that attac is not " antiglobalization " as such , but rather critical of the economic side of the process .
" while markets are integrating globally , democracy is still based on nation-states , " giegold said in a dw-world interview .
" that means the possibility of democracies to regulate for social security and environmental protection is limited . "
unexpected level of success attac quickly spread beyond france ’ s borders and now has branches in forty countries .
in germany , where the group formed two years ago , its membership has grown exponentially , jumping from 400 members last year to 6,500 today .
membership skyrocketed particularly after the g8 protests in genoa last july . -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after such a dizzying climb , the german branch of the organization met in frankfurt / main over the weekend to take stock and to consider where to go from here .
the participants in the lecture hall at the university of frankfurt ranged from the vociferous students who are those most visible during anti-globalization demonstrations , to older women well into middle age , their husbands wearing their grey , thinning hair pulled back into ponytails .
" there are quite a lot of people from the ‘ 68 movement who have left their armchairs and are getting back to work , " said giegold , referring to the widespread student protest wave thirty-four years ago .
the challenge , according to giegold , is to keep the movement focused on its core issue , the economics of globalization , and resist the pressure to dilute that message .
that is proving difficult , he says , since as membership grows , people bring a whole variety of ideas with them about how attac should try to change the status quo .
" we are not a group with just one ' – ism ' behind it , so there is definitely a danger there , " giegold said .
" we have to be careful that we don ’ t demand everything in trying to make the world a better place , " above the political fray part of staying true to that core idea is staying out of politics .
although attac is making a name for itself as a vocal critic of globalization and even attracting the attention of mainstream politicians fo late , it still has no political aspirations , according to giegold .
he denied any comparisons to germany ’ s green party , a vocal , grassroots protest movement in the late 1970s that eventually went on to hold real political power .
in fact , attac has become one of the green ’ s most vociferous critics , accusing the party of betraying its core principles in exchange for political success .
attac sees itself as being closer to organizations along the lines of greenpeace or friends of the earth , non-governmental movements whose members might well also be members of established political parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for attac to remain uncorrupted and effective , it has to stay on message , giegold said .

calling for people in the entertainment business to think carefully about going to cannes , the ajc appealed to them to raise the issue of anti-semitism whenever they could .

the european globalization-critical group attac has become a leading voice against neo-liberal economic policies .
a member of attac 's leadership spoke with dw-world on the direction the group is taking . at any protest against the world bank or the international monetary fund these days , members of attac will almost certainly be on the front lines .
the group , formed in france in 1998 , has become one of the leading critics of the neo-liberal economics of globalization striking a chord with thousands across europe .
" people are concerned these days about social justice , environmental problems and democracy in the process of globalization , " said sven giegold , a member of attac ’ s steering committee .
he insists that attac is not " antiglobalization " as such , but rather critical of the economic side of the process .
" while markets are integrating globally , democracy is still based on nation-states , " giegold said in a dw-world interview .
" that means the possibility of democracies to regulate for social security and environmental protection is limited . "
unexpected level of success attac quickly spread beyond france ’ s borders and now has branches in forty countries .
in germany , where the group formed two years ago , its membership has grown exponentially , jumping from 400 members last year to 6,500 today .
membership skyrocketed particularly after the g8 protests in genoa last july . -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after such a dizzying climb , the german branch of the organization met in frankfurt / main over the weekend to take stock and to consider where to go from here .
the participants in the lecture hall at the university of frankfurt ranged from the vociferous students who are those most visible during anti-globalization demonstrations , to older women well into middle age , their husbands wearing their grey , thinning hair pulled back into ponytails .
" there are quite a lot of people from the ‘ 68 movement who have left their armchairs and are getting back to work , " said giegold , referring to the widespread student protest wave thirty-four years ago .
the challenge , according to giegold , is to keep the movement focused on its core issue , the economics of globalization , and resist the pressure to dilute that message .
that is proving difficult , he says , since as membership grows , people bring a whole variety of ideas with them about how attac should try to change the status quo .
" we are not a group with just one ' – ism ' behind it , so there is definitely a danger there , " giegold said .
" we have to be careful that we don ’ t demand everything in trying to make the world a better place , " above the political fray part of staying true to that core idea is staying out of politics .
although attac is making a name for itself as a vocal critic of globalization and even attracting the attention of mainstream politicians fo late , it still has no political aspirations , according to giegold .
he denied any comparisons to germany ’ s green party , a vocal , grassroots protest movement in the late 1970s that eventually went on to hold real political power .
in fact , attac has become one of the green ’ s most vociferous critics , accusing the party of betraying its core principles in exchange for political success .
attac sees itself as being closer to organizations along the lines of greenpeace or friends of the earth , non-governmental movements whose members might well also be members of established political parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for attac to remain uncorrupted and effective , it has to stay on message , giegold said .
" even if attac is very sexy at the moment , we shouldn ’ t go into the center of the peace or environmental movement , " giegold said .
" other groups can do -lsb- that work -rsb- better than we can . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin gears up for bush u.s. president george w. bush will visit germany next week .

the european globalization-critical group attac has become a leading voice against neo-liberal economic policies .
a member of attac 's leadership spoke with dw-world on the direction the group is taking . at any protest against the world bank or the international monetary fund these days , members of attac will almost certainly be on the front lines .
the group , formed in france in 1998 , has become one of the leading critics of the neo-liberal economics of globalization striking a chord with thousands across europe .
" people are concerned these days about social justice , environmental problems and democracy in the process of globalization , " said sven giegold , a member of attac ’ s steering committee .
he insists that attac is not " antiglobalization " as such , but rather critical of the economic side of the process .
" while markets are integrating globally , democracy is still based on nation-states , " giegold said in a dw-world interview .
" that means the possibility of democracies to regulate for social security and environmental protection is limited . "
unexpected level of success attac quickly spread beyond france ’ s borders and now has branches in forty countries .
in germany , where the group formed two years ago , its membership has grown exponentially , jumping from 400 members last year to 6,500 today .
membership skyrocketed particularly after the g8 protests in genoa last july . -lrb- photo -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after such a dizzying climb , the german branch of the organization met in frankfurt / main over the weekend to take stock and to consider where to go from here .

" there are quite a lot of people from the ‘ 68 movement who have left their armchairs and are getting back to work , " said giegold , referring to the widespread student protest wave thirty-four years ago .
the challenge , according to giegold , is to keep the movement focused on its core issue , the economics of globalization , and resist the pressure to dilute that message .

" i am honoured and moved to receive this prestigious prize for a film which represents poland " , polanski said .
the film is said to be very personal .
polanski , 68 , himself a jew , survived the krakow ghetto but lost his mother in a nazi concentration camp .
it is the first time that polanski , director of classics such as chinatown , repulsion and rosemary ’ s baby has received the palme d ’ or .
finnland ’ s kati outinen won the award for her performance as a salvation army officer in the man without a past .
belgium ’ s olivier gourmet took the award for best actor in le fils -lrb- the son -rrb- .
pomp and politics despite the usual glitz and glamour , this year ’ s film festival was one with a difference .
a large number of films focused on current politics .
two films up for the golden palm drew attention to the growing violence between israelis and palestinians .
in addition , the whole festival was thrown into the political spotlight just a few days before the opening when the american jewish congress -lrb- ajc -rrb- called for its members to boycott the event .
calling for people in the entertainment business to think carefully about going to cannes , the ajc appealed to them to raise the issue of anti-semitism whenever they could .
ajc president jack rosen insisted that his organization was not calling for a general boycott of france , but rather wanted to increase awareness for what he saw as growing anti-semitism in the country , referring to the attacks on jewish institutions in previous months following tensions in the middle east as well may ’ s rise of one-time presidential contender jean-marie le pen .
the matter led to public dispute , as leading figures in the french jewish community spoke out against the ajc ’ s call for a boycott , saying the french government had publicly condemmed any anti-semitic violence .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- breakfast -pipe- why celebrate ba 's £ 200m loss ?
news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : programmes : breakfast news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk monday , 27 may , 2002 , 04:14 gmt 05:14 uk why celebrate ba 's £ 200m loss ?
analysis by declan curry bbc breakfast 's business presenter british airways has reported its worst results since it was privatised 15 years ago , but its annual loss of £ 200m is not quite as terrible as it seems .
they may not have said " great news - we lost 200 million quid ! " , but that sums up the relief at british airways and in the city about the airline 's latest losses .
at first glance , the figures are frightening .
ba has turned in the worst financial performance since it was privatised back in the 1980s .
even though it 's still losing a fortune , there 's relief that it is n't losing more a calamitous year has sent the airline from healthy profit to bulging loss .
the amount of business the company writes has dived by 10 % , with turnover coming in at £ 8.3bn.
fewer people are flying on its planes - passenger numbers overall are down by 4.5 % over the last year .
in the asia-pacific region , the number of passengers has slumped by 18.4 % .
but there 's one good reason to take the club-class champagne out of the ice bucket .
today 's loss was much lower than the city 's analysts had been predicting .
qualified relief one team of company watchers had predicted an underlying loss of as much as £ 460 million .
so , even though it 's still losing a fortune , there 's relief that it is n't losing more .
the heroes of the hour are the bean counters and the credit for keeping the lid on its losses is going straight to the boardroom .
but not to the chief executive or the chairman .
the heroes of the hour are the bean counters - ba 's finance director , john rishton , and his team .
their tight control on costs has stemmed the flow of red ink .
on a tight leash the total cost of ba running its business in the first three months of this year was 12 % lower than it was exactly one year before .
ignoring the savings from the thousands of jobs cuts , the cost of doing business still fell by 6 % over the year .
put simply , mr rishton and his colleagues have made the company 's nuts and bolts cheaper .
ba is paying less for its fleet of planes , less for the fuel that keeps them flying , and in some cases less for the rights to land and take off at airports .
and it has made that core part of its business cheaper to run without - apparently - damaging the service .
that 's earned the company some praise from the big shareholders and institutions .
one fund manager said securing these cuts without affecting operating performance was the most impressive part of today 's story .
the savings appear to have been won through good old-fashioned , poker-school negotiation .
crisis management the crisis in the airline industry may have given ba a stronger hand when dealing with suppliers , finance companies and airports , but it also had the people who knew how and when to deal those cards to best effect .
but today 's book-juggling will appear easy by comparison with the bean counters ' next big task .
at the last count , ba owed some £ 6.6bn.
put another way , it owed its lenders and creditors nearly £ 2 for every £ 1 worth of ba shares on the market .
it 's not a crippling debt burden of the size that bt or marconi ended up with , but bt 's recovery - and marconi 's continuing near-death experiences - show the debt has to go before solid recovery starts to set in .
ba 's problem is that there 's not much spare cash to give to the bank manager .
do n't misunderstand this - ba is no longer seen as being in danger of running out of cash .
it 's just that there 's very little left under the mattress for emergencies or prudence - especially as the cash cow go was sold -lrb- to someone who made even more money out of it -rrb- .
the company ca n't look to its trading to generate a surplus .
ba 's chief executive rod eddington says he expects his market to remain " soft " over the next year .
the analysts say ba will turn in another loss next year , and they 're not ordering in the marching bands for the year after that just yet .
new money so how will ba raise cash to cut its debts ?
there is one easy answer - to take more money off its shareholders .
but the company says that 's not an option , and it has no plans either to create new shares and sell them , or swap some debt for new shares .
that assumes , though , that ba will have the freedom to make that decision .
its lenders may have other ideas , especially if ba continues to struggle against the low-cost carriers in europe , and if the pick-up in its trans-atlantic business is delayed .

the heroes of the hour are the bean counters " and the credit for keeping the lid on its losses is going straight to the boardroom .
but not to the chief executive or the chairman .
the heroes of the hour are the bean counters - ba 's finance director , john rishton , and his team .
their tight control on costs has stemmed the flow of red ink .
on a tight leash the total cost of ba running its business in the first three months of this year was 12 % lower than it was exactly one year before .
ignoring the savings from the thousands of jobs cuts , the cost of doing business still fell by 6 % over the year .
put simply , mr rishton and his colleagues have made the company 's nuts and bolts cheaper .
ba is paying less for its fleet of planes , less for the fuel that keeps them flying , and in some cases less for the rights to land and take off at airports .
and it has made that core part of its business cheaper to run without - apparently - damaging the service .
that 's earned the company some praise from the big shareholders and institutions .
one fund manager said securing these cuts without affecting operating performance was the most impressive part of today 's story .
the savings appear to have been won through good old-fashioned , poker-school negotiation .
crisis management the crisis in the airline industry may have given ba a stronger hand when dealing with suppliers , finance companies and airports , but it also had the people who knew how and when to deal those cards to best effect .
but today 's book-juggling will appear easy by comparison with the bean counters ' next big task .
at the last count , ba owed some £ 6.6bn.
put another way , it owed its lenders and creditors nearly £ 2 for every £ 1 worth of ba shares on the market .
it 's not a crippling debt burden of the size that bt or marconi ended up with , but bt 's recovery - and marconi 's continuing near-death experiences - show the debt has to go before solid recovery starts to set in .
ba 's problem is that there 's not much spare cash to give to the bank manager .
do n't misunderstand this - ba is no longer seen as being in danger of running out of cash .
it 's just that there 's very little left under the mattress for emergencies or prudence - especially as the cash cow go was sold -lrb- to someone who made even more money out of it -rrb- .
the company ca n't look to its trading to generate a surplus .
ba 's chief executive rod eddington says he expects his market to remain " soft " over the next year .
the analysts say ba will turn in another loss next year , and they 're not ordering in the marching bands for the year after that just yet .
new money so how will ba raise cash to cut its debts ?
there is one easy answer - to take more money off its shareholders .
but the company says that 's not an option , and it has no plans either to create new shares and sell them , or swap some debt for new shares .
that assumes , though , that ba will have the freedom to make that decision .
its lenders may have other ideas , especially if ba continues to struggle against the low-cost carriers in europe , and if the pick-up in its trans-atlantic business is delayed .

hong-kong conglomerate hutchison whampoa and singapore technologies telemedia have announced that negotiations ended without a deal after the groups failed to agree on terms with global crossing 's banks and creditors .
the two asian companies had signed a letter of intent to inject $ 750m into the ailing firm in exchange for a 79 % stake in the company 's stock .
global crossing has said it will continue to talk with potential investors about auctioning off its networks in 27 different countries .
the group filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors on 28 january with liabilities totalling $ 12bn and assets worth $ 22.4bn.
like many telecoms and technology companies , global crossing - which built a business laying huge-capacity fibre-optic cables around the world - went on an acquisition spree to extend its operations .
its expansive plans were predicated on a relentless growth in demand for network capacity , but technical advances and massive competition mean the expected demand has evaporated .

the results suggest that concern about the government 's record on racism is shared across white , black and asian communities .
indeed , the poll indicates that whites are least satisfied with the government 's efforts .
the icm survey , part of a major bbc news online series on race relations in the uk , is one of the largest surveys on race conducted in recent years .
of all those asked , 50 % said not enough was being done over racism .
half those whites asked were of that view , with 47 % of blacks and 44 % of asians saying the same .
twenty-eight percent of all those asked said enough had been done to combat racism .
one in three asians said they were satisfied along with 30 % of blacks and 29 % of whites .
however , 35 % of those asked felt that the government had improved race relations .
prominent asians are most happy with ministers ' efforts , with 43 % of those asked saying labour had improved race relations compared to 42 % of black respondents and 36 % of white respondents . "
the prospect of a tory or labour party leader from an ethnic minority background seems a long way off " gurbux singh chairman , cre almost one in four people said the government had harmed race relations .
a home office spokeswoman said : " we acknowledge that racism and discrimination continue to exist and have done a great deal to address it .
" we know , however , that there remains a great deal to be done . "
she pointed to amendments to the race relations act introduced two years ago which widened and strengthened the anti-discrimination provisions .
party leaders respondents rated the chances of people from ethnic minorities being appointed to prominent positions in society .
a total of 46 % thought someone from a black or asian background would one day become labour party leader but only 21 % felt an mp from an ethnic minority would ever lead the conservatives .
the position that black and asian respondents thought it was most likely an ethnic minority person would fill was head of the metropolitan police in london , followed by labour leader and editor of a national newspaper .
non-white mps they felt someone from an ethnic minority was least likely to become lord chancellor , conservative leader or the archbishop of canterbury .
one of the frontrunners to fill that post in october this year is the pakistan-born archbishop of rochester , dr michael nazir-ali .
of all those questioned , 29 % thought there would one day be a prime minister from an ethnic minority background , though fewer blacks and asians felt this way .
the survey also indicates support among more than half those blacks and asians asked for more non-white mps .
white respondents were more split on the issue , with 36 % saying there should be more non-white mps and the same proportion saying there were enough .
there was a similar verdict over whether positive action should be taken to increase the number of non-white people in parliament .
' hardly suprising ' most blacks and asians favour the idea , but 42 % of whites oppose the move compared with 36 % in favour .
gurbux singh , chairman of the commission for racial equality -lrb- cre -rrb- , told bbc news online : " when you consider that there are only 12 black or asian mps out of the 659 sitting in the house of commons , the prospect of a tory or labour party leader from an ethnic minority background seems a long way off . "
he said the political parties had set a " large , but not impossible " challenge to get more ethnic minority candidates .
" only time will tell if the political parties ' rhetoric becomes reality , " he said .
freedom of speech the poll also suggests that many people - including around one in three blacks and asians - feel far-right parties such as the british national party should have freedom of speech .
of all those asked 54 % said the bnp and other parties with strong views on race and immigration should have the same freedom of speech as other political parties .
that view was backed by 55 % of whites , 36 % of black respondents and 34 % of asians questioned .
but similar numbers of black and asian respondents - 39 % and 36 % respectively , said the bnp should not have freedom of speech .
of those who are opposed to bnp freedom of speech , 55 % said there should be a total ban on the party .
notes on polling data : between 7 -11 may icm research interviewed 1,576 people aged 18 and over .
the interviews were conducted face-to-face and quotas were used to ensure that at least 500 interviews were conducted with people from white , black and asian backgrounds .
the data collected was then weighted to bring it into a balance with a national profile of all adults .
the margin of error for the poll is plus or minus 3 % .
however this margin increases when the answers are based on smaller groups within the total sample .
for example , when just asian people are mentioned or when other individual groups are extracted from the total number of people asked .

in bbc wales 's current affairs programme taro naw , due to be broadcast on monday night , consultant psychiatrist dr huw davies calls for immediate investment as the number of patients looks set to rise . "
we are already in crisis .
investment is needed now , we ca n't afford to wait " dr huw davies , consultant psychiatrist one in 10 people in wales suffers from depression , and it is expected that 20 % of the population will experience a mental health problem during their lifetime .
the world health organisation estimates that by 2020 depression will be the second main cause of disability in the world - second only to heart disease .
" we do not have enough beds , not enough psychiatrists nor slots to see patients early on , " said dr davies , who works in bridgend , south wales .
" in the meantime , their depression deteriorates .
we are already in crisis .
" investment is needed now , we ca n't afford to wait , " he added .
in england , a national service framework for mental health was introduced two years ago , but there is no such plan as yet available for wales .
so far the welsh assembly , which has prioritised mental health along with cancer and heart disease , has not decided on a framework nor extra expenditure for services in wales .
a serious shortage of specialists in the field is adding to the problem - according to figures from the royal college of psychiatrists , 43 of the 139 consultant psychiatrist posts remain vacant in wales .
equality hope the problems mean that few of the 290,000 current patients in wales receive appropriate treatment .
" if you happen to be a patient in wales the people who are there to help are under more pressure compared to the new resources being invested in england , " said dr davies .
" we 're looking forward to the same equality before long . "
in a statement to taro naw , the assembly said that recruiting problems were a uk-wide matter that is " not just related to wales " .
officials added that some of the vacancies had come about as new posts had been created .
" the assembly is in regular contact with the royal college and has agreed there should be a care group work force review to support the forthcoming national service framework for mental health in wales , " read the statement .
the statement went onto say that attempts to recruit consultant psychiatrists from overseas are under way .

in bbc wales 's current affairs programme taro naw , due to be broadcast on monday night , consultant psychiatrist dr huw davies calls for immediate investment as the number of patients looks set to rise .
we are already in crisis .
investment is needed now , we ca n't afford to wait dr huw davies , consultant psychiatrist one in 10 people in wales suffers from depression , and it is expected that 20 % of the population will experience a mental health problem during their lifetime .
the world health organisation estimates that by 2020 depression will be the second main cause of disability in the world - second only to heart disease .
" we do not have enough beds , not enough psychiatrists nor slots to see patients early on , " said dr davies , who works in bridgend , south wales .
" in the meantime , their depression deteriorates .
we are already in crisis .
" investment is needed now , we ca n't afford to wait , " he added .
in england , a national service framework for mental health was introduced two years ago , but there is no such plan as yet available for wales .
so far the welsh assembly , which has prioritised mental health along with cancer and heart disease , has not decided on a framework nor extra expenditure for services in wales .
a serious shortage of specialists in the field is adding to the problem - according to figures from the royal college of psychiatrists , 43 of the 139 consultant psychiatrist posts remain vacant in wales .
equality hope the problems mean that few of the 290,000 current patients in wales receive appropriate treatment .
" if you happen to be a patient in wales the people who are there to help are under more pressure compared to the new resources being invested in england , " said dr davies .
author gwyneth lewis speaks of her experiences " we 're looking forward to the same equality before long . "
in a statement to taro naw , the assembly said that recruiting problems were a uk-wide matter that is " not just related to wales " .
officials added that some of the vacancies had come about as new posts had been created .
" the assembly is in regular contact with the royal college and has agreed there should be a care group work force review to support the forthcoming national service framework for mental health in wales , " read the statement .
the statement went onto say that attempts to recruit consultant psychiatrists from overseas are under way .
in taro naw , two women speak of their personal experience with depression , including poet and author gwyneth lewis .

the group will give evidence on monday to the united nations committee 's working group on minorities about the threat to welsh-speaking communities in rural areas .
the un committee - which reports back to the commission on human rights - aims to promote and protect the rights of groups belonging to linguistic and ethnic minorities .
cymuned has now been recognised by the united nations on the international stage dr jerry hunter , cymuned it is understood to be the first occasion evidence has been taken from wales .
cymuned has been given 15 minutes to present its concerns about the future of welsh-speaking areas and will be represented by dr jerry hunter and judith humphreys .
ahead of the trip , dr hunter said : " this is the first time ever a welsh organisation has been given official accreditation to present evidence to the united nations .
" cymuned has now been recognised by the united nations on the international stage . "
he added : " welsh-speaking communities are a minority community , and as a minority community , they have rights under international law . "
protests to support the language have gone on for decades cymuned was formed last year in the wake of controversial comments by gwynedd councillor seimon glyn about english incomers being a " drain on welsh-speaking communities " .
his comments rekindled the debate of the language issue and led to a series of high profile welsh speakers adding to calls for welsh assembly suport for rural communities .
cymuned has attracted support from disaffected plaid cymru members , academics and professionals .
among several proposals was a bid to aid welsh speakers by placing restrictions on outsiders owning second homes .
in february , cymuned member simon brooks warned " civil disobedience " was inevitable unless the assembly 's review of the language delivered acceptable solutions .
tv licence refusal welsh language board chairman rhodri williams , said the threats were a mistake and that people should make their feelings known through the ballot box .
in the past , welsh activists have occupied public buildings , sprayed slogans , climbed television masts and refused to pay tv licence fees .
a bbc wales poll earlier this year revealed one third of welsh-speaking parents never use the language when talking to their children .
the survey also revealed that just four in 10 mothers and fathers who speak welsh routinely use the language within their family .
the survey , conducted by beaufort research for bbc wales , also found resistance to welsh as a compulsory subject in secondary schools .
in addition , 60 % of the 1,004 people interviewed believe monoglot english-speaking incomers to welsh heartlands make an economic contribution to their communities .

as head of venezuela 's biggest business organisation , fedecamaras , mr carmona marshalled business and trade union opposition to mr chavez 's economic policies .
the armed forces backed carmona for 48 hours so it was no surprise that the venezuelan armed forces chose the 60-year-old economist and oil executive to take the reins of the world 's fourth biggest oil exporter .
but his time in office was short-lived - only 48 hours - and hugo chavez was restored to power on 14 april .
after the failed coup , mr carmona was placed under house arrest , accused of rebellion and usurping the presidency .
he denies the charges , saying the military asked him to head a transitional administration .
when a court ordered his transfer to prison , he sought refuge in the colombian embassy and asked for asylum .
capable people an economist who studied in venezuela and belgium , mr carmona worked for most of his life in the private sector .
he also represented venezuela in economic and commercial missions abroad .
chavez was quickly restored to power juan calvo , a business executive who has worked with mr carmona for many years , described him as " a balanced and intelligent man , a leader who knows how to resolve problems . "
" he always surrounds himself with capable people , " mr calvo told the french news agency , afp .
mr carmona initially attempted dialogue with mr chavez , whose authoritarian style and left-wing populism alarmed venezuela 's traditional ruling classes .
but he ended up forging an unexpected alliance with the trade unions .
together , the two sides organised strikes and massive street demonstrations that led to mr chavez 's brief downfall .
laws repealed once ridiculed as an " oligarch " and " scrawny " by hugo chavez , mr carmona moved immediately to repeal economic laws introduced by mr chavez as part of his " bolivarian " revolution .
ensuring that venezuela 's vital oil exports quickly resume normal levels was one of his priorities .
as soon as he was sworn in , he appointed several right-wing figures to his administration , signalling his intention to end to venezuela 's close relations under chavez to cuba , libya and the group of 77 unaligned nations .

but the bank insisted that use of the european currency remained patchy , playing down fears of " euro-creep " , or introduction of the euro by stealth .
last year , 60 % of british firms had predicted that the proportion of sales and purchases invoiced in euros would increase .
in fact , only 45 % of firms reported that this had happened , the bank said .
at the same time , use of euros in retail transactions remains restricted to a handful of stores in tourist areas , and even there accounts for an infinitesimal proportion of turnover .
banking on the euro use of the euro is now widespread among company bank accounts , where it has overtaken the dollar as the most popular foreign currency .
at the end of march , the bank found there were over 145,000 euro accounts , of which around 90,000 were held by firms .
and the european currency is widespread in border regions - especially northern ireland , the only part of the uk that abuts directly onto the eurozone .
but the bank insisted that the use of euros in northern ireland was no higher than the previous use of irish punts , indicating that the introduction of the single currency had not encouraged consumers to change their habits significantly .
smooth running less cheering for the eurosceptics , however , was the bank 's verdict on the changeover to cash euros at the beginning of this year .
the launch , the bank said , was a huge success and one that britain would learn from should it decide to join .
opponents of the currency had been hoping for logistical chaos at the turn of the year , to increase public opposition to the loss of the pound .
but the bank concluded that the current timetable for euro entry - still something of a mystery - could not be speeded up without running risks .
popular opinion remains unconvinced over the euro , something the government hopes may change after many britons handle the currency for the first time on holiday this summer .

they will argue on monday that they need the arrangements in order to protect the identity of one of its agents , code-named infliction .
he has claimed that sinn fein 's martin mcguinness , told him that he fired the first shot on bloody sunday .
the saville inquiry is examining the events of 30 january 1972 when 13 civilians were shot dead by british army soldiers during a civil rights march in the city .
a 14th person died later .
under the proposed arrangements , lawyers for the families , the soldiers and mr mcguinness would not be allowed into the hearing chamber during infliction 's testimony .
the families of those killed will oppose the application and barristers for the soldiers are also expected to say they are not happy with the proposed arrangements .
on friday , mi5 representatives held a private meeting with the bloody sunday tribunal in london .
infliction is said to have been a former senior member of the ira .
in april last year , a document from infliction said mr mcguinness , now the education minister in northern ireland 's power-sharing executive , appeared to have it on his conscience that he had fired the shot which led to the civilians being killed .
' look stupid ' the sinn fein mp firmly rejected the allegation .
former mi5 officer david shayler cast doubt on the reliability of the information , saying the informer was " terminated " shortly afterwards when mi5 chiefs were made to " look stupid " having relied on faulty information he had supplied .
lord saville of newdigate and the commonwealth judges accompanying him on the bloody sunday inquiry began their work nearly four years ago .
they are not expected to report back until 2004 .
the bloody sunday inquiry was established in 1998 by prime minister tony blair after a campaign by families of those killed and injured .
they felt that the widgery inquiry , held shortly after the shootings , did not find out the truth about what happened on bloody sunday .

frances lawrence , 51 , told how a probation officer rang her at home and said that learco chindamo had become upset after she criticised him for his lack of remorse .
mrs lawrence , a mother of four , said the officer claimed an apology would make chindamo " feel happier " when he came before a panel which was deciding whether his life sentence should be cut .
chindamo was 15 when he stabbed mr lawrence to death as he defended a pupil outside st george 's roman catholic school in maida vale , west london in december 1995 .
frances lawrence : " shocked " by answerphone message mrs lawrence had criticised the youth in several television programmes , but it was unclear which one had upset him .
mrs lawrence said of the probation officer 's call : " she left a message on the answering machine for my children to hear , which i was not happy about at all .
" she was direct and very cross with me on the phone . "
mrs lawrence said : " i was very shocked after i heard the whole thing and it was very surreal .
" she said it was because he -lsb- chindamo -rsb- would be very upset at his ' lifer board ' . "
she added : " i was shocked and i said that i was not going to say anything to her and would take the matter further , which i did . "
appeal refused a home office spokesman said : " the national probation service places great importance on its duty to victims .
philip lawrence : stabbed in the head by chindamo " however this contact which took place over six months ago was entirely inappropriate .
" the chief probation officer of the area concerned and a representative of the national probation service have since visited mrs lawrence to apologise for this mistake .
" an internal investigation was conducted and appropriate action was taken with regard to the officer concerned . "
chindamo , a member of a gang of youths , was convicted of the killing at the old bailey in 1996 and jailed for life .
last year an attempt to have his minimum sentence cut from 12 years was turned down .
