"
the white house expects to prevail because our case is strong " ari fleischer , white house spokesman the general accounting office - the investigative arm of congress - wants the vice president , dick cheney , to release information about the special energy taskforce he headed .
white house officials have refused to hand over records of the taskforce , arguing that this would stop the administration from getting candid advice from outside experts .
the gao investigation is quite separate from official inquiries into the collapse of enron over debt and accounting irregularities , and began as long ago as april 2001 .
but interest in the documents has increased as nine congressional inquiries begin probing enron 's business practices , the failure of government regulation and whether the company exercised undue influence over government policy .
the gao specifically wants details of the discussions between the taskforce and enron to find out what influence the corporation and other energy companies had on its final energy proposals .
in a letter to the white house , comptroller general david walker said he " would have strongly preferred to avoid litigation in connection with this matter " , but would now file suit in a us district court .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said the administration was confident it would win the court case .
candid advice the white house is withholding the records of the national energy policy development group on a point of principle .
surrendering the details of the talks , officials say , would make it impossible for governments to hold private and uninhibited discussions in the future .
gao investigation who was present at each meeting of the energy task force ?
what are the names of the professional staff assigned to the task force ?
who did the task force members meet , and why and when ?
what direct and indirect costs were incurred in developing the national energy policy ?
mr cheney said there were no secrets to hide : " we talked to all kinds of people .
i talked to energy companies , i talked to labour members , talked to environmentalists . "
mr fleischer added the president would " stand for the right of presidents ... to receive candid advice without it being turned into a news release " .
the gao counters that " contrary to recent assertions , we are not seeking the minutes of these meetings or related notes of the vice president 's staff " .
but critics have accused the government of being too close to industry interests when it formulated its federal energy plan last spring .
enron and its chief executive kenneth lay were generous donors to the election campaign of president george w bush , although the firm showered money on senators and representatives from both parties .
potential embarrassment the man behind the lawsuit is the comptroller general , david walker , who is in charge of the general accounting office .
he has impeccable republican credentials , and was a volunteer working for the presidential campaign of george bush sr. despite this partisan background , mr walker said his team was ready " to do our job " , arguing that the gao had the right to get the information , because the energy task force was funded by taxpayers .
the bbc 's michael buchanan in washington says members from both parties are seeking detailed disclosures of enron 's discussions with the energy taskforce .
what the administration paints as nothing murkier than a business failure , he says , has the potential , therefore , to turn into a political embarrassment .

mr karzai 's desire to see an expanded international force to help maintain law and order in his war-torn nation is likely to be at the top of his agenda .
on wednesday he appealed to the united nations security council to commit more troops to prevent factional fighting , warning that the future stability of the country would otherwise be in jeopardy .
the current british-led force will soon reach its planned size of 5,000 in kabul and mr blair has pledged to provide long-term help to afghanistan as the country recovers from taleban rule .
but mr karzai , who has the backing of the exiled king zahir shah , wants the force to cover the entire country , an aim that would require a commitment of many thousands more troops .
support mr karzai , 44 , will arrive in london after meetings at the un and talks with us president george w bush in washington .
the prime minister is keen to continue the dialogue with the new administration in afghanistan official spokesman he is due to join ministers at the end of their weekly cabinet meeting .
mr karzai will have the chance to address the ministers - and is thought to be the first to be given the honour since president clinton .
mr blair will then have talks with mr karzai in private before they hold a joint press conference .
mr blair 's official spokesman said : " the prime minister is keen to continue the dialogue with the new administration in afghanistan .
" as the prime minister has said many times , we wo n't repeat the mistakes of the past and walk away from the people of afghanistan , and that means not only giving financial support but also means giving political support , which is why he feels it appropriate that the president attends the last few minutes of cabinet . "
mr karzai 's interim defence minister will also be in london to hold talks with the ministry of defence about its possible role in training a new afghan army .
police force on wednesday mr karzai told the un that the billions of dollars of aid pledged to help rebuild afghanistan would be spent well and honestly .
but he suggested an international force must remain in afghanistan for longer than the planned six months of the british-led force .
mr karzai did not say how large the contingent should be , or how long it would be required for , but he said it would take time to train a new national army and police force .
mr bush told him that us forces would help to train a new afghan military , but he made clear he would not commit american troops for peacekeeping duties .
the discussions took place amid new reports of factional fighting in afghanistan near the town of gardez , which is patrolled by us forces .
home soil earlier this month , mr blair became the first world leader to visit afghanistan since the fall of the taleban .
he met the mr karzai on his home soil , at the bagram air base north of kabul .
in a speech he made a promise that britain would not abandon afghanistan and acknowledged that much was still to be done to rebuild the country .

hynix , badly hobbled by $ 6bn in debt , has for months been in on-again , off-again discussions with micron , the us company and world number two in the memory chip market .
reprots suggest the two are deadlocked over a price , with micron offering around $ 3bn and hynix ' creditors hoping for something closer to $ 5bn .
infineon has also had problems .
the sharp decline in memory chip prices in recent months has devastated profitability across the sector , and infineon has recently admitted that things look unlikely to improve in the near future .
and its own talks with toshiba about possible co-operation came to an inconclusive end in december , after toshiba decided to sell up to micron .
stalemate with semiconductor prices on the rise again , at least moderately , memory chipmakers are keen to stabilise that position and ward off the drastic fluctuations which have been the rule .
in an interview with the nihon keizai shimbun newspaper , infineon chief executive ulrich schumacher said his company and hynix were examining several possible forms of co-operation , including joint ventures .
a hynix spokesman played down the news .
but the urgency of hynix 's situation is likely to be underscored by its financial performance in the last three months of 2001 , set to be unveiled in the next few weeks .
the south korean company is expected to have lost more than $ 3bn , a far worse deficit than any of its peers .

undergraduates in wales were among 1,000 people asked about the state of their finances for the report published on thursday .
in the survey , one-in-four students admitted to being in financial trouble .
but almost 90 % of them continued to spend money on mobile phones and regular trips to the pub .
the survey by unite , a company which provides student accommodation , showed the average student spends £ 20 a week on alcohol .
it also revealed that students in wales were more likely than others to say their choice of university was dictated by its proximity to their family home .
nearly half of the students questioned - 46 % - said they would prefer to keep the existing system of loans , rather than the re-introduction of maintenance grants which could result in higher taxes after graduation .
protest rallies in november last year hundreds of students joined a rally outside the wales office in cardiff to protest against levels of hardship .
they demanded the abolition of tuition fees and the re-introduction of maintenance grants .
protestors threw their loose change into a pile , symbolising students ' rising debt .
figures from the national union of students -lrb- nus -rrb- indicated that an average student in wales , even after receiving the full student loan , will experience a shortfall in income of £ 3,596 for every year spent in third level education .
last year the welsh assembly education minister jane davidson put £ 20m into student access and hardship funds for wales following an independent report into the problem .
the rees report recommended the abolition of tuition fees and the introduction of maintenance grants .

the survey by unite , a company which provides student accommodation , showed the average student spends £ 20 a week on alcohol .
it also revealed that students in wales were more likely than others to say their choice of university was dictated by its proximity to their family home .
nearly half of the students questioned - 46 % - said they would prefer to keep the existing system of loans , rather than the re-introduction of maintenance grants which could result in higher taxes after graduation .
protest rallies in november last year hundreds of students joined a rally outside the wales office in cardiff to protest against levels of hardship .
they demanded the abolition of tuition fees and the re-introduction of maintenance grants .
students demonstrated in cardiff last year protestors threw their loose change into a pile , symbolising students ' rising debt .
figures from the national union of students -lrb- nus -rrb- indicated that an average student in wales , even after receiving the full student loan , will experience a shortfall in income of £ 3,596 for every year spent in third level education .
last year the welsh assembly education minister jane davidson put £ 20m into student access and hardship funds for wales following an independent report into the problem .
the rees report recommended the abolition of tuition fees and the introduction of maintenance grants .

the company , which last year entered an alliance with rival hitachi to try to save money on chip and software development , slumped to a 155bn yen -lrb- $ 1.2bn ; £ 800mn -rrb- net loss for the final three months of 2001 .
the reasons it gave have become a refrain in the business .
mobile phone sales have fallen off sharply from the breakneck pace of the late 90s , while computer demand too is well off its peak .
nec 's chipmaking operations were deeply in the red , a situation reflected in other earnings news this week .
on 29 january , both fujitsu and toshiba reported their own heavy losses .
the total deficit for the big five chipmakers for 2001 now looks likely to reach 1.17 trillion yen .
cuts continue for the full financial year , which in japan ends in march , the company is expecting to record a loss of almost double that , or 300bn yen .
as recently as september , the company was expecting a full year deficit of 150bn yen , while in april 2001 it was confident of clearing a 65bn yen profit .
and more job losses are on the way as well .
nec has already said it will cut 4,000 jobs by march .
of these , 1,800 or 1.2 % of its global workforce come from its own staff , while 2,200 will be drawn from subcontractors .
but now it has admitted that another 10,000 jobs are on the line in the next three months .
harsh comparison as has become the rule in the electronics business , there is a stark contrast between the 2001 performance and that of the year before .
in the same three months of 2000 , nec managed a 8.3bn yen profit , while its sales were down year on year to 1.13 trillion yen from 1.24 trillion yen .

average uk house prices grew by 0.2 % in january compared to the previous month , and by 11.7 % from january 2001 , the company said on thursday .
but rising unemployment is expected to dent consumer confidence in the coming months , slowing house price inflation for the year as a whole to just 6 % .
house price growth has already slowed from an annual rate of 13.8 % in the year to december , nationwide said .
price crash unlikely nationwide 's forecast is in line with those issued by other major mortgage lenders .
nationwide group economist alex bannister said that house prices are still " holding up well " despite a slowing economy and rising fears over job losses .
" the reasons are straightforward , with strong real take-home pay and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years offsetting fears over increased job uncertainty . "
although unemployment edged slightly higher late 2001 , reflecting large-scale manufacturing lay-offs , the jobless rate remains historically low .
the survey suggests that a property market crash on a par with the late 1980s slump , when many homeowners were left paying off mortgages worth more than the value of their houses , is unlikely .
nationwide said that lower borrowing costs and higher real incomes have made mortgages more affordable , with repayments for first time buyers swallowing up just 26 % of take-home pay , down from 50 % in the 1980s .
the average house in the uk is now worth £ 93,231 , nationwide said , an 85 % increase from 1996 .
lender caution the survey added that caution among lenders , many of whom refuse to lend more than 95 % of the value of the house , should slow price growth in london , the country 's main property hotspot .
earlier this month , nat west and alliance & leicester both introduced curbs on mortgage lending in areas where prices have risen steeply due to fears that buyers may be overextending themselves .
natwest said that about one in four london postcodes would be affected .
on wednesday , nationwide 's rival halifax lost an appeal against a ruling that it was wrong to keep some mortgage holders on higher rates while offering cut-price loans to new customers .

ebay has already ventured into the fine arts world by buying butterfield and butterfield , a smaller competitor of sotheby 's in 1999 .
sotheby 's was at pains to stress that real-world auctions , complete with nods and winks , gavels and auction blocks , will remain the core of the business .

since 1971 , they and their predecessors virtually took over the elegant swiss ski resort of davos in the last weekend of january .
business chairmen and chief executives cut deals .
political leaders used the unique swiss surroundings to search for solutions to their most intractable problems largely behind closed doors they debated cutting edge issues of the globalised economy , technology and challenges to world order .
business chairmen and chief executives cut deals .
political leaders used the unique swiss surroundings to search for solutions to their most intractable problems of war , the environment or even just basic co-existence .
but the terror attacks on 11 september and the apparently synchronised global recession required a deft refocusing of the davos principles .
' exceptional times ' with fears that many us business and political leaders would simply decline to travel to switzerland , the wef 's board moved swiftly last autumn .
as the forum says : " for exceptional times , an exceptional programme for davos-new york " .
the waldorf will be full of networkers so for four days from thursday , the confined corridors of new york 's famous hotel , the waldorf astoria , will be transformed into a crush of name droppers and networkers .
the focus of the forum will be " leadership in fragile times " .
but with the massive bankruptcy of enron , the us congressional pressures on auditors arthur andersen and many corporate failures of the past year , a sizeable number of familiar corporate faces from the past wo n't even qualify to be here .
not only are the repercussions of the global terror threat a central issue .
so is the very credibility of corporate governance in the world 's biggest economy .
a fragile world business life is under the microscope , and so are all the many unattained hopes and expectations for globalisation and the dot.com revolution raised at davos in the past few years .
business life is under the microscope , and so are all the many unattained hopes and expectations for globalisation for once there is also a sense of fragility , not complacency among the biggest of big names gathered here .
they have discovered they no longer have a monopoly on wisdom .
some of them have shown themselves to be flawed .
the strongest voices here will be those who have found ways to survive recession and just stay in business during the year of fragility .
globalisation debate this year , the core focus will be restoring economic growth of some kind , after the burst of the dot.com bubble , along with debating the new costs of national and corporate security in the aftermath of 11 september .
and what about all those hopes and aspirations for globalisation ?
protesters will march down the streets of new york a test of the inclusivity of the forum will be the level of debate involving ngos , religious leaders and anti-globalisation forces .
it is tempting to view the anti-globalisation lobby as just those who take to the streets and - as in davos - smash up mcdonald 's or confront the riot police .
but the events - business failures and tragedies of the past year - have shown that they have concerns that deserve a hearing , equal to those of the 1,000 most powerful corporations .
last year , some of the outside environmental and globalisation lobbyists invited into the davos meeting were incensed by the way they were treated .
this year the organisers promise greater sensitivity and greater inclusivity .
many are not convinced and have declined involvement .
protesters will make their voices heard on the streets in new york .
but as 2001 showed , of equal importance are the voices at the rival gathering of anti-globalisation interests in porto alegre , brazil , where there is no corporate wealth on show .
a new mood in new york ?
the move to new york is either a smart move for anxious times or a disastrous move that many davos hands say will kill dead the informal networking spirit that has given the forum such renown .
then again , the world changed after 11 september , and with it so many approaches and attitudes , including those of the power brokers here .
with the time pressures of modern political and business life , it could be that many can no longer afford the trek from zurich into the mountains for what was once a six-day gathering .
yet , those privileged enough to be included on the invitation list will certainly still feel themselves to be part of something unique .
time to ' schmooze ' ?
given the proliferation of international conferences , what is the attraction of the wef ?
the cynics - and those not there - will say " to schmooze " .
wef people say it is to brainstorm , freewheel and try to chart the increasingly tempestuous waters ahead - if that is possible .
the lucky ones on the invitation list have navigated unidentifiable barriers and qualification thresholds set by the forum organisers to be allowed into the high-security sanctum of the conference centre .
the less fortunate - who believe themselves to be qualified - spend much of the year trying to use every ruse possible to secure the most sought-after white cards .
the spirit of davos past the regulars identify themselves by sight .
in past years in davos , they learned about the perils of sheet ice and the insanity of wearing the best leather-soled shoes in one of switzerland 's premier ski resorts .
the mountains of davos will give way to manhattan they also discovered that even the smartest bmw or mercedes becomes a redundant liability when a metre of snow falls in 36 hours and shuts the roads up from zurich .
the terrain of midtown manhattan , the unusually balmy winter weather and a conference confined to a single hotel will remove such risks .
but this year there is nervousness of a different kind .
after the explicit warnings from the us attorney general , john ashcroft , and the us director for homeland security , tom ridge , about the hidden capacities of al qaeda , there remains here an unspoken anxiety .
what might be the targets of the covert threats from osama bin laden 's thousands of disciples , as mentioned by president george w bush in his state of the union speech ?
' participation ' many corporate men and women representing trillions of dollars of business wealth expect to be here as ' davos tribesmen ' almost as of right .
professor schwab envisaged a meeting where all could mix where else could you bump into the hedge fund investor george soros ?
where else could you end up sitting next to a foreign minister or a corporate chairman worth billions ?
one basic rule : always have that instant question or topic of conversation ready for the big name suddenly standing at your shoulders .
the founder of the wef , professor klaus schwab , envisaged an environment where corporate bosses , political leaders , trade unionists , as well as authors and journalists could mix comfortably .

since 1971 , they and their predecessors virtually took over the elegant swiss ski resort of davos in the last weekend of january .
business chairmen and chief executives cut deals .
political leaders used the unique swiss surroundings to search for solutions to their most intractable problems largely behind closed doors they debated cutting edge issues of the globalised economy , technology and challenges to world order .
business chairmen and chief executives cut deals .
political leaders used the unique swiss surroundings to search for solutions to their most intractable problems of war , the environment or even just basic co-existence .
but the terror attacks on 11 september and the apparently synchronised global recession required a deft refocusing of the davos principles .
' exceptional times ' with fears that many us business and political leaders would simply decline to travel to switzerland , the wef 's board moved swiftly last autumn .
as the forum says : " for exceptional times , an exceptional programme for davos-new york " .
so for four days from thursday , the confined corridors of new york 's famous hotel , the waldorf astoria , will be transformed into a crush of name droppers and networkers .
the focus of the forum will be " leadership in fragile times " .
but with the massive bankruptcy of enron , the us congressional pressures on auditors arthur andersen and many corporate failures of the past year , a sizeable number of familiar corporate faces from the past wo n't even qualify to be here .
not only are the repercussions of the global terror threat a central issue .
so is the very credibility of corporate governance in the world 's biggest economy .
a fragile world business life is under the microscope , and so are all the many unattained hopes and expectations for globalisation and the dot.com revolution raised at davos in the past few years .
business life is under the microscope , and so are all the many unattained hopes and expectations for globalisation for once there is also a sense of fragility , not complacency among the biggest of big names gathered here .
they have discovered they no longer have a monopoly on wisdom .
some of them have shown themselves to be flawed .
the strongest voices here will be those who have found ways to survive recession and just stay in business during the year of fragility .
globalisation debate this year , the core focus will be restoring economic growth of some kind , after the burst of the dot.com bubble , along with debating the new costs of national and corporate security in the aftermath of 11 september .
and what about all those hopes and aspirations for globalisation ?
a test of the inclusivity of the forum will be the level of debate involving ngos , religious leaders and anti-globalisation forces .
it is tempting to view the anti-globalisation lobby as just those who take to the streets and - as in davos - smash up mcdonald 's or confront the riot police .
but the events - business failures and tragedies of the past year - have shown that they have concerns that deserve a hearing , equal to those of the 1,000 most powerful corporations .
last year , some of the outside environmental and globalisation lobbyists invited into the davos meeting were incensed by the way they were treated .
this year the organisers promise greater sensitivity and greater inclusivity .
many are not convinced and have declined involvement .
protesters will make their voices heard on the streets in new york .
but as 2001 showed , of equal importance are the voices at the rival gathering of anti-globalisation interests in porto alegre , brazil , where there is no corporate wealth on show .
a new mood in new york ?
the move to new york is either a smart move for anxious times or a disastrous move that many davos hands say will kill dead the informal networking spirit that has given the forum such renown .
then again , the world changed after 11 september , and with it so many approaches and attitudes , including those of the power brokers here .
with the time pressures of modern political and business life , it could be that many can no longer afford the trek from zurich into the mountains for what was once a six-day gathering .
yet , those privileged enough to be included on the invitation list will certainly still feel themselves to be part of something unique .
time to ' schmooze ' ?
given the proliferation of international conferences , what is the attraction of the wef ?
the cynics - and those not there - will say " to schmooze " .
wef people say it is to brainstorm , freewheel and try to chart the increasingly tempestuous waters ahead - if that is possible .
the lucky ones on the invitation list have navigated unidentifiable barriers and qualification thresholds set by the forum organisers to be allowed into the high-security sanctum of the conference centre .
the less fortunate - who believe themselves to be qualified - spend much of the year trying to use every ruse possible to secure the most sought-after white cards .
the spirit of davos past the regulars identify themselves by sight .
in past years in davos , they learned about the perils of sheet ice and the insanity of wearing the best leather-soled shoes in one of switzerland 's premier ski resorts .
they also discovered that even the smartest bmw or mercedes becomes a redundant liability when a metre of snow falls in 36 hours and shuts the roads up from zurich .
the terrain of midtown manhattan , the unusually balmy winter weather and a conference confined to a single hotel will remove such risks .
but this year there is nervousness of a different kind .
after the explicit warnings from the us attorney general , john ashcroft , and the us director for homeland security , tom ridge , about the hidden capacities of al qaeda , there remains here an unspoken anxiety .
what might be the targets of the covert threats from osama bin laden 's thousands of disciples , as mentioned by president george w bush in his state of the union speech ?
' participation ' many corporate men and women representing trillions of dollars of business wealth expect to be here as ' davos tribesmen ' almost as of right .
where else could you bump into the hedge fund investor george soros ?
where else could you end up sitting next to a foreign minister or a corporate chairman worth billions ?
one basic rule : always have that instant question or topic of conversation ready for the big name suddenly standing at your shoulders .
the founder of the wef , professor klaus schwab , envisaged an environment where corporate bosses , political leaders , trade unionists , as well as authors and journalists could mix comfortably .
but will that work in new york , with jammed streets and the frustrations of moving speedily through this city ?
participation will be the key .
" we are not a conference " the organisers have always emphasised .
" there is no preaching from the platform " .
there are no " delegates " or " attendees " .
we are all " participants " .
nik gowing will be chairing a wef world debate on bbc world on 2 february at 2210 gmt , which is repreated on 3 february at 0910 and 1820 gmt .

the series will be renamed tianxian baobao - mandarin for antenna babies - and aired on cctv1 , the major state tv channel .
the series , which has been a ratings and commercial success for the bbc , has also attracted controversy .
some educationalists criticised the " baby talk " of tinky winky , dipsy , laa-laa and po , saying that exposure to it could harm speech development in the show 's pre-school target audience .
tinky winky has courted controversy that charge is not accepted by the programme makers , who say the teletubbies help infants develop their communication and language skills .
but translation of the teletubbies ' unique language for a chinese audience may prove to be a problem .
there have been reports that , after trying to recreate the four characters ' method of talking into mandarin , new actors had to be found to dub the lines to the bbc 's satisfaction .
' gay lifestyle ' the export success of teletubbies has brought other problems .
when the show was first broadcast in the us in 1999 , the christian campaigner jerry falwell accused tinky winky of " modelling the gay lifestyle " .
tinky winky , though apparently male , carries a handbag , is purple - " the gay-pride colour " and his antenna is " shaped like a triangle - the gay-pride symbol " .
but steve rice , a spokesman for itsy bitsy entertainment , which licenses the teletubbies in the us , responded by saying : " it 's a children 's show , folks .
to think we would be putting sexual innuendo in a children 's show is kind of outlandish . "
and dave thompson , the first actor to play tinky winky , was sacked in 1997 , after producers said he had interpreted the character incorrectly .
' risks ' the british actor said : " i was always the one to test out the limitations of the costume .
" i was the first to fall off my chair and roll over .
i took all the risks . "
world sales of teletubbies and its spin-off merchandise has made a fortune for its creators as well as for the bbc .
in 2001 it was reported that the teletubbies had made £ 116m for the bbc 's commercial arm , bbc worldwide .

bbc news -pipe- talking point -pipe- asylum seekers : is the government justified ?
categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : talking point front page world uk uk politics business sci / tech health education entertainment talking point forum in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics thursday , 31 january , 2002 , 09:00 gmt asylum seekers : is the government justified ?
a 15-day hunger strike staged by asylum seekers at a remote detention centre in australia has ended .
more than 240 asylum seekers - mainly afghans - abandoned their protest after the government promised to treat their claims to asylum in a more transparent fashion .
several detainees had been refusing food and water - and activists had warned the australian government it was only a matter of time before someone died .
prime minister john howard said his government 's tough immigration policies would not be watered down by the continued unrest .
should the government have given into the asylum seekers ' demands ?
were the asylum seekers right to carry out their hunger strike ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the australian government is absolutely right in its tough stance against illegal immigrants .
í am also an afghan immigrant , but i did not gate crash into some country .
my whole family took refuge in pakistan for four years before being granted asylum in the us .
there is no guarantee that these illegal immigrants will not defy the law of the land even if they are given asylum .
they may continue to break the law in future and if convicted , may complain of discrimination .
dawood ibrahim , us the australian government 's treatment of refugees is shameful disgrace .
after the success of the sydney olympics and the good which that achievement did to australia on an international stage it is depressing to see such an ugly side to what is a beautiful country .
what 's even more depressing is that so many australian citizens appear to rabidly support such a morally bankrupt government .
jon , uk in these days of terrorism , they owe it to their people to be extremely cautious .
richard , us the australian government , as an elected representative of the australian people , has every right to determine who is let in the country .
and in these days of terrorism , they owe it to their people to be extremely cautious .
the western world can not take economic immigrants .
those whose lives are threatened by a current regime , must find asylum in the nearest country .
the others want a better economic life .
but common sense will tell you if a nation with its own culture and values gets swamped , those very values that created a well off society will be at risk .
the host country is rich because of its people , not the land they live on .
newcomers who adapt to the cultural and historical values of the country they go to , do much better than those who do n't .
but the question was : who has rights here , the australians represented by their government or the illegals .
the illegals have no rights .
richard , us surely people accept that a country -lrb- australia or otherwise -rrb- can only accept a finite amount of immigrants within a certain period of time .
those who are genuinely fleeing for their lives should be given priority over those who are fleeing for a better standard of living .
in order to do this you need to find out who these people are .
unfortunately , as has happened in the uk , may immigrants do a disappearing act before their claims can be processed .
so various governments are now using detention centres .
what would those who object to these centres suggest ?
that you allow unrestricted and unchecked entry for everyone who turns up ?
e. wilson , uk i am of the widely-held opinion that australia 's immigration policies are largely racist in motivation .
the government does not take anywhere near the same line when it comes to europeans who have overstayed their visas , or work illegally .
this is pointed out in newspaper editorials regularly .
these people may even outnumber the migrants from asia - i lived in australia on a youth-work exchange , and i can tell you for a fact that there are thousands of young people working illegally in sydney alone .
when they are found out they are certainly not put into concentration camps pending their expulsion .
matthew , usa i have been to australia and long before that seen what a great place it looks like .
so -lrb- being only a teenager at the time -rrb- i looked at their immigration policy with a view to emigrate when i was adult .
however if you check it out you will they no longer accept " £ 10 poms " .
for me -lrb- a british working university student -rrb- it is very hard to get in to , i would even have to take a language test - on my first language .
which is fair enough - why would they want to let me in if one million me 's want in .
so why should they be forced to make exceptions for asylum seekers whom on the whole do not speak english , have not got much work experience , and will more than likely be a burden to the australian economy rather than an addition ?
i know the usa -lrb- and the 51st state -rrb- likes to get involved with other countries , but that ¿ s no reason to force values on australia .
for the record i do hope to emigrate once i have a degree , about 8 years work experience , am still under 30 , and have the necessary funds .
it ca n't be one rule for some and another for others .
graham , uk australia has the second highest refugee intake per capita in the world .
chris hurst , uk / australia the fact that has been ignored in this whole situation is that australia has the second highest refugee intake per capita in the world .
no genuine refugee is ever refused entry into australia , and these refugees receive some of the best aid packages on offer in the world .
the australian government are correct to discourage people smugglers and queue jumpers from entering the country illegally , and should continue detaining asylum seekers and processing their claims properly before allowing them australian residency .
chris hurst , uk / australia a refugee is an individual who seeks asylum in the nearest safe country .
an immigrant picks and chooses a desired country to live and work in .
these people in the detention centres have chosen australia as their destination and therefore should be treated as immigrants , not refugees .
it 's as simple as that .
there are thousands of people from all parts of the world -lrb- not just white parts -rrb- who are waiting to immigrate to australia and have followed the correct legal procedures .
it would be unfair to them to allow people who have illegally entered the country with no documents , records or identification before them especially if they do n't meet the criteria set out for everyone .
indonesia has turned a blind eye to allow their progression to australia and has received virtually no criticism on this issue .
and what country in it 's right mind would be welcoming of an individual who sews his / her lips together to make a point ?
jeremy d , australia australia seems to feel immigrants are no longer to be made welcome in the country .
perhaps they should remember that australia is a nation of immigrants who stole the land from the aborigines and denied them many of their basic human rights .
the afghan refugees simply seek protection , and the right to share in australia 's culture - they have no desire to obliterate it and replace it with one of their own .
australia - look to your history .
you should be ashamed rachel uk no western country has had to absorb anything near the number of refugees that poor countries have to deal with dapo , uk australia 's policies are just plain disgraceful and inhumane .
no western country has had to absorb anything near the number of refugees that poor countries have to deal with .
iran , pakistan , tanzania etc have had to deal with millions -lrb- yes millions ! -rrb- of refugees each .
however rich countries like australia and the uk complain about the few thousands -lrb- no exaggeration -rrb- who come their way .
shame on you !
i ca n't believe that some people -lrb- e.g nic and chris b below -rrb- try to make a distinction between " indigenous australians " and the new asylum seekers .
i presume that the former does not just refer to the aboriginal population of australia .
the overwhelming majority -lrb- about 99 % -rrb- of australians are immigrants or descended from immigrants .
how can they complain about others who try to follow in their footsteps .
even if one assumes that the asylum seekers are just economic migrants is that a reason for treating them so badly ?
dapo , uk i think the australian government should either , immediately repatriate the asylum seekers as soon as they arrive illegally , or treat them in a more humane fashion and process their claims quicker , the camps are bad for everyone and have left the detainees in limbo , in a half world of non existence .
dave , hong kong the australian federal government are doing a good job , under the most trying conditions .
the people involved are no more then " queue jumpers " we take more then our fair share of refugees .
the government must make a stand and have a proper system of refugees coming into this country malcolm freeman , australia i think the australian government , and , by the tone of many preceding letters , a considerable number of the australian people , should be ashamed of their treatment and attitude toward the asylum seekers .
this reasoning would appear to be an unpleasant reflection of the discredited " whites only " policies which existed in australia not too long ago .
australia , like canada and the u.s. , were forged by immigrants and refugees of many origins , and we are the better for it .
the more the people of the world mix and intermarry , the more understanding will eventually prevail .
there will be no end to war , terrorism , or refugee crises as long as huge economic inequities exist .
in canada , we are under pressure from the " great bully " next door to align our policies with theirs in the wake of their recent events .
-lrb- yes , i have an interest in what happens in oz .
over the years two sisters , their families , and our parents went down-under -lrb- from britain -rrb- , both my daughters have visited and loved it -rrb- .
diana gallaway , canada what particularly bothers me in this whole situation is the impact upon the children involved .
from reports there are children in there who are without parents .
i fully agree with their request that they be placed into foster care while their cases are being examined .
woomera is no place for anyone , especially not kids .
erin j , france / australia our new immigration policy here in australia puts us in breach of our international obligations under the un 's convention relating to the status of refugees and its related protocol , the convention on the rights of the child , the international covenant on civil and political rights and the universal declaration of human rights .
why do australians have no qualms about violating these obligations ?
at least some of the blame must lie with our media .
during our recent election campaign 90 % of our newspaper editors told their readers that they should vote for howard despite , and in some instances because of , his immigration policies .
the murdochs , packers and other owners of mass media should be ashamed .
rainer mathews , australia i am so proud to be australian at the moment and i applaud the australia government shelley jones , australia / uk i am so proud to be australian at the moment and i applaud the australia government which , for once , is listening to what its national residents want .
for once we have a government that is listening .
no one demands a visa to get into a country - they stand in line like everyone else .
anyone who travels through several countries is not an asylum seeker .
these people have chosen to go to australia and should be grateful for the shelter and food they are receiving from australian tax payers ! ! !
shelley jones , australia / uk resident i have watched the way that australia has treated its refugees over the past year .
australian politicians deny that these concentration camps are prisons .
it 's true : they are not prisons .
real prison inmates are allowed to work for extra money , have access to real education , they are treated as individuals and they generally are not locked up with their children .
the only difference is that real prison inmates are guilty of a crime .
these poor asylum seekers have done nothing wrong except to try and save themselves and their children from the terror of the countries they have fled .
they would love to work in the australian community and earn their keep .
i love australia , i swore allegiance to it - a free choice on my part , but i feel ashamed .
it is not simply the government but the people who are generally in support of mistreating asylum seekers .
brendan , australia / uk i fully back the australian government in their decision not to be forced to change their policy just because some illegal immigrants are objecting .
as some of the other respondents have stated , the idea of asylum is that the asylum seeker goes to the nearest ' safe ' country .
to expect anyone to believe that the closest safe country to afghanistan is australia is plainly ludicrous .
the same thing can be said of the uk .
what the asylum seekers are doing is heading for the nearest big western country where they can have access to food , medicine and education way beyond what their own country has .
australia has recognised this and is refusing to give in .
if only the uk would do the same , and other european countries share the burden more fairly , then those of us who are subsidising more and more illegal immigrants might get some justice .
julia hopson , uk the government should decide their cases faster - say within a maximum of one year .
the savings made in food and upkeep and medical expenses could be directed to increasing the efficiency of the refugee acceptance system .
anyone waiting more than one year should be released while their case is being examined .
if they want to reject 99 % of them that is their decision but let them know either way within a year so they do n't suffer needlessly .
behrooz , iran of course the australian government is justified .
there may or may not be a case for considering some illegal entrants as political refugees and there may be grounds for granting residency on the basis of the economic contribution immigrants might make , but the simple facts are these .
firstly illegal entrants are not indigenous citizens .
they have human rights that should be respected , but not the right to freely move around before their status has been established - and there must be question marks over the legitimacy of people who seek political asylum having passed through at least one stable democratic country to reach australia .
secondly there is no automatic right of asylum , and many stable nations would be destabilised if the people of the world were allowed to cherry pick which nation they would like to settle in without there being good grounds for consideration .
thirdly , submitting to the demands of the asylum seekers where there are not good grounds for providing refuge is elitist because it is invariably the wealthy would-be immigrant who is able to travel half way round the world to seek asylum .
most people with genuine grounds for seeking asylum normally have insufficient means to make it further than the nearest border to their homes , if that .
nic , uk the refugee 's suffering is a shameful reflection of our own greed and fear .
gary lord , australia throughout my voting life , john howard 's liberal conservative party has shamefully manipulated a streak of latent xenophobia which survives in opposition to australia 's multicultural values .
the problem is not unique to australia , nor is the inhumane treatment of refugees .
if the western world ever makes serious efforts to improve life in the third world , these problems may disappear .
till then , the refugee 's suffering is a shameful reflection of our own greed and fear .
australia is a wealthy country with a strong multicultural tradition .
if we can not show compassion , who will ?
the irony is that while refugees eager to work are being kept at bay , australian papers are running articles about the impending retirement problems posed by an ageing population .
gary lord , australia i do n't see what gives us the " right " to detain these people - especially when they are then trapped and ca n't go forwards or backwards and do n't know how long they 'll be there and whether they 'll get a fair hearing .
while i enjoy my standard of living - i do n't expect my government to protect it by trampling on those fleeing poverty or persecution .
julian n , australia first of all , the debate about what is an illegal asylum seeker is a nonsense .
in countries such as pakistan and afghanistan , the police wo n't even let people into the compound of the australian consulate , let alone hand them out asylum applications .
the conditions to apply for asylum are so appalling that the only option for those desperate to flee is to pay dodgy ' people-smugglers ' .
this does not make their case any less compassionate than bona-fide asylum seekers .
in fact , if anything , theirs is probably the more desperate lot .
second , many asylum seekers come -lrb- or are coming -rrb- from countries where the west has fought proxy wars .
afghanistan is the most recent example .
iraq is another case .
it is about time we realise that these are chickens coming home to roost .
azhar ali abidi , australia it is hypocritical of the howard government to have supported the coalition war in afghanistan and then to treat afghani refugees inhumanely by incarcerating them in remote detention centres such as the desert , and pacific islands offshore .
their contempt for political democracy is evident by journalists repeated being denied access to asylum seekers .
anna schlusser , australia i recently went on a hunger strike in solidarity with the hunger strikers in woomera tamara , sydney , australia people keep talking about " protecting borders " - protect our borders from what ? people fleeing for their life on sinking ships ?
there is so much i 'd love to say about this issue , especially in response to some of the extremely naive comments already posted , which go to show the extent to which so many people have swallowed the government 's racist and uniformed propaganda .
i recently went on a hunger strike in solidarity with the hunger strikers in woomera , and i believe all camps should be closed , and refugees ' passage to australia should be assisted .
tamara , sydney , australia i am astounded by the lack of compassion displayed here .
many of those first ' safe ' countries that the refugees arrive at have enough problems of their own , and no spare cash to deal with them .
if the shoe was on the other foot , all these people who are quick to condemn these unlucky refugees would also go to the first economically prosperous country themselves - it is a perfectly understandable act .
it is certainly in australia 's ' self-interest ' to treat these refugees they way they do , but does n't this kind of reasoning make it difficult to hold one 's head up high ?
hannah , uk i am a british migrant in australia .
i have grown to love this country and the generosity of its people .
yes australians are all ultimately migrants themselves , but they are also intelligent people .
it is clear to them that they are being blackmailed by a group of people who have come to australia to take advantage of this generosity .
if they wanted safety why did n't they stay in indonesia ?
it 's infinitely more safe than afghanistan .
they are economic migrants , and the australian people know this and know they are being blackmailed .
howard and ruddock are simply doing what any sensible politician does - following the will of the majority electorate .
iain , australia i fully support the howard government 's decision on illegal immigrants .
australia has long been seen as one of the most multi-cultural countries in the world .
it continues to lead by allowing substantial numbers of refugees on par with our population - australia lets in the second highest amount of refugees per population .
while these people are leaving countries of desitution , to be a legal refugee under u.n status you must claim for refugee status in the first country you arrive in .
these illegal immigrants have come through many countries including pakistan and indonesia to illegally enter australia .
these people are not true refugees but instead people who have the money to afford these passages to where they wish to live .
people who sew theirs and their children ¿ s lips together , stage violent protests and send their children alone on this arduous journey across the sea in order to claim family status have no right to be in australia , where violent protests and child abuse are seen as a disgrace .
this moral blackmail must stop , and australia is simply protecting its democratic right to allow people of our choice to enter this country , while they do not claim refugee status .
detentions such as woomera have been highly criticised but a independent tribunal has recently declared the conditions in wommera to be extremely good .
children are taken to local schools ; air conditioning and comfortable lodgings , as well as numerous leisure activities are supplied .
many facilities continue to be built but are constantly being destroyed by these violent protests .
congratulations mr howard and keep protecting our democratic rights .
ed , australia it seems that many forget people that australia 's location puts it in a more precarious position with the developing world .
northern europeans can afford be sanctimonious about the refugee " crisis " because there is no danger of them being inundated by people seeking to improve their economic conditions .
what we all need to do , regardless of nation , is find ways to cure the endemic poverty and violence of these countries .
accepting economic refugees will always be a band aid solution .
richard henman , canada what happened to the policy that the refugees must seek refuge in the first country outside the one they are fleeing .
charles , usa why are the refugees australia 's responsibility .
what happened to the policy that the refugees must seek refuge in the first country outside the one they are fleeing ?
the refugees are not entitled to " pick and choose " their country of residence .
afghan refugees have passed through indonesia and other countries .
any one of these countries could have processed there claims , but the refugees refused to stay .
they demand australia .
the same thing is happening in the uk .
the afghan refugees have passed through turkey and western europe and demand residence in the uk .
why ?
charles , usa howard should be immediately put in a detention centre for committing crimes against humanity in his illegal and uncompassionate treatment of both aborigines and asylum seekers .
and to those australians who agree with his racist policies - do n't forget that the majority of you are the descendants of economic refugees from europe , who did n't even ask for permission to live in australia .
you should be ashamed of yourselves .
scott hemphill , germany -lrb- ex australia -rrb- australia has always made it clear it puts people who illegally enter it 's country in detention centres , so why do people who illegally enter the country complain ?
louise o 'brien , australia do n't get the australian public 's attitude confused with that of the government .
before people talk about " australia 's attitude " or " australia 's inhumanity " etc. they should keep in mind that the australian public is deeply divided on this issue .
there are more people against the government than most people think .
things have changed since the election last year .
michael , australia to be allowed to stay there whilst the situation is sorted out is something to be grateful for .
chris b , england australia belongs to australians - so let them run their country as they see fit and let 's cut out this holier than thou attitude .
whilst i do n't necessarily agree with john howard 's attitude , he is possibly learning from the mistakes made by other countries , some of whose immigration policies might be considered a little too relaxed .
i believe that genuinely displaced individuals whose life is endangered should be offered immediate sanctuary elsewhere - but i am also aware that this particular band wagon will grow as big as any host country allows it to become .
the fact is , australia 's asylum seekers are at least being held in australia , when they might easily have been turned round and sent straight back to where they came from .
to arrive unannounced en-masse in a foreign country and expect an automatic right to be given immediate citizenship is unreasonable - so to be allowed to stay there whilst the situation is sorted out is something to be grateful for .
if people want to arrive in australia and promptly protest about the way it is run , by refusing food , then let them .
they 're probably getting their first taste of what democratic rights are about .
moreover , a hunger strike is reducing the australian government 's expenses incurred on the asylum seekers ' behalf .
if you enter a foreign country by breaking its rules , the least you can do is keep your head down and do as you 're told thereafter .
chris b , england a state granting asylum is entitled to grant it on its own terms , subject to the observation of basic human rights .
asylum seekers are in no position to demand anything .
if i were that desperate to leave my own country i would be willing to accept any terms of a state willing to allow me food water shelter and a lack of torture .
phil , uk it must be remembered that australians have a working immigration policy that offers residence to tens of thousands of potential immigrants every year .
this includes a quota intended for legitimate refugees facing persecution , in varying forms , the world over .
this policy requires due course , and formal process in order that a fair and equitable allocation of positions is adhered to .
simply jumping to the front of the queue is not acceptable .
i know of no country on the planet that willingly allows free movement by unauthorised foreigners across its borders .
that is tantamount to chaos .
for better or worse we currently reside on a planet that is divided into neo political boundaries , this is the actuality , for a civilised society to grow , it must first establish internal security , this is achieved by the creation of laws and policies .
australia has a well thought out , equitable and just immigration policy and we have a duty not to be deterred from this policy by a handful of extortionate asylum seekers .
adam , australia we are hardly being swamped in comparison to the uk , pakistan or indonesia s clarkson , australia i 'm ashamed of australia 's current policies because they are race based .
currently we have over 60,000 illegal over-stayers here in australia mainly from the us and the uk .
almost no effort is made to police and deport these illegals .
at the same time we are spending millions to imprison and degrade men women and children , most of whom are eventually proven to be bona-fide refugees for long periods of time .
there are million of refugees in the world yet australia gets approx .
4000 uninvited refugees per year - we are hardly being swamped in comparison to the uk , pakistan or indonesia .
we do n't treat or punish all our uninvited equally and until we do other are justified in pointing the finger of reproach at us .
s clarkson , australia the afghans in question fled their own country to escape what the west has subsequently branded a terrorist regime , and successfully evicted at the cost of a great deal of money and a great number of lives .
i do n't understand how we feel able to outlaw a state on the one hand , and refuse to shelter dissidents escaping from that state on the other .
why should afghan refugees go back to help " rebuild " their country ?
their country has been demolished by the actions of another state , over which they had no influence or control .
they are n't responsible - why do n't the people who made the mess take responsibility for their actions and clear it up ?
we might have won our own fictitious little war , but that does n't mean that afghanistan is suddenly a democracy .
personally , i think that those of us who enjoy the political and economic advantages of life in western democracies have an obligation to support escapees from other regimes whose actions we 're happy to criticise from afar .
and yes , australia is a nation of immigrants , like britain , and look what the current defenders of the nation did to the original inhabitants .
stella hawkins , u.k. the australian government is entirely justified in it 's actions .
their first duty is to protect the safety and continued prosperity of those who are in australia legally .
were howard to give in to what amounts to nothing other than emotional blackmail then they would be failing in that duty .
james , england -lrb- australian by birth -rrb- the australian pm talks about open door policy - that would be immigrants should apply through the front door .
that statement alone tells volumes ; welcome if you are white and from the right sort of country , otherwise do n't bother .
i would like to see the australian pm spend a few days living in the camp in naro , then i might take his opinion seriously .
if australia wants to avail itself of international law and international funds , then it should also uphold international law .
as it stands , it has acted illegally , irresponsibly and unethically and the people should be ashamed of themselves and their government .
i for one would never visit or invest in australia or anyone from that country .
janeen , usa as far as i am concerned anybody who claims asylum should be housed and fed in safety and comfort in closest safe country to the one of origin , i.e. if you arrive in australia from afghanistan via several other countries including malaysia -lrb- which has an islamic culture and is safe -rrb- then you must be an economic migrant rather than a bona fide asylum seeker .
we in the uk are soft on immigration and it will hurt us in the long run as our cultural heritage becomes devalued .
if we need people to boost our economy we should do what the gulf states do and issue fixed term work permits which are cancelled at the end of the period and you have to leave that country .
basically 99 % of asylum seekers are economic migrants .
andy , uk lucky for all those people from the " civilized " world that all indians , american natives , aborigines etc , did not have " immigration policies " at the time .
otherwise they would have seen first hand how it is to live in misery and not be able to do anything about it .
the only reason these " developed " nations are doing so well now is because they had free access to land and resources the world over , with no one telling them " go back where you came from " .
i think people should study a bit more of their very bloody history and then just shut up rather than coming up with moral stances .
paul , uk / romania the response of the australian politicians and people are as expected .
this is the normal response of most people in all countries .
the difference is that the australians are open about their choice .
no other country had the opportunity to vote in a government on the single issue of immigrants .
if they had the outcome would be the same .
it is simply a characteristic of human nature that can only be overcome by deep thinking , reasoning and compassion .
clearly howard , the australians and most of the world have along way to go before rising above the caveman mind-set .
until then we truly are just naked apes dressed in suits with a fierce sense of superiority .
ken , switzerland australia like all countries has a legal procedure for asylum application .
those who arrive illegally and destroy their personal documents prior to arrival should expect to have a lengthy visa application .
these people should apply through the regular channels like all who seem asylum or migration .
ken , turkey people who sew their children 's lips together , attack guards , commit arson may attract lawyers , the media and do-gooders like moths to light but violently demanding visa 's rather than asking does n't get much sympathy from the average aussie. al greer , australia the asylums seekers are definitely right to carry out their hunger strike .
those from afghanistan have suffered for 23 years and at the moment they suffer in australia , but the australian government does n't care about them .
they should n't be blamed , the international community could blame australia for not treating them as refugees .
khaaled hamza , united kingdom i strongly believe in australia 's immigration policy .
all eu countries should officially agree to follow a similar pattern .
nicolas a. , uk the australian government is totally justified in its actions john o 'connor , eire i think the australian government is totally justified in its actions .
these people are just using unrest in their country to enter a prosperous country , if they were proper refugees they would have stayed in the nearest safe country .
john o 'connor , eire jackie mckerrell , clearly is n't in touch with " the larger australian community " .
the reality is , the vast majority of australian 's strongly support the action taken by the howard government .
just because a few hundred people are very vocal in their opposition to australia 's policy towards illegal immigrants , it does n't mean that the rest of the community feels the same .
unlike many other democratic countries , our government takes actions that reflect the views of the majority , not the vocal " bleeding heart " minority .
ben kerr , perth , australia i am really shocked that people from other countries are condoning the inhumane and indefensible treatment of asylum seekers and refugees .
they are not illegal migrants , it is not illegal to arrive in a country and ask for asylum .
i 'm disappointed that the bbc is constantly reporting the protests by the refugees but failing to mention the mounting protests and actions by the larger australian community - from non governmental bodies to school kids taking over the ground floor of the immigration department in melbourne .
jackie mckerrell , australia as an afghan i express my great gratitude to britain , which has granted refugee status to our poor people who have suffered since 23 years of continues war .
australia does n't have human feelings .
khaaled hamza , afghanistan well , as there is no reason left for them to seek asylum , they should go back to afghanistan and contribute to what 's going on there .
i totally supported australia 's stance on this issue from the beginning - these " asylum seekers " were trouble from the get-go !
mark m. newdick , us / uk how refreshing to see a democratic country stands by its decisions on immigration , despite all the pressures from the uninformed .
michael evans , uk it is what happens when we have a prime minister who was in politics in the 60s and who gives the impression that he is still thinking with the mentality of that time , and he has been " milking as much as he could at the last elections , playing on the people phobias .
as far as the political landscape is concerned , only the " greens " have taken a stance against this sort of attitude and they have doubled their national vote while the " democrats " lost ground in their " wishy-washy " attitude .
things are changing and the australian people are not what their government tend to portray to the world .
john f , australia the australian government is right to stick to its ' policy on asylum seekers a. byfield , uk the australian government is right to stick to its ' policy on asylum seekers .
these people should be eager to get back to help rebuild their country instead of engaging in psychological blackmail against australia .
a. byfield , uk it is in australia 's best interest to keep its tough immigration policies .
mark , canada australians have forgotten their migrant roots .
they have now become more old world than the europeans in their attitudes and that is nothing to celebrate .
shame on australia and its people .
kevin brown , scotland howard is merely obeying the electorate 's wishes which were made very clear during the last election .
to deviate from this course would be totally undemocratic .
besides , the asylum seekers stopped in indonesia first where they were perfectly safe - their subsequent voyage to australia simply makes them illegal immigrants .
james s , australia the bleating british political class should put their money where their mouth is and offer to take these people into the uk .
then you can view first hand the sort of repugnant media stunts that disgusts this nation .
ross mackenzie , australia australia 's stance is justified .
if these were genuine ' refugees ' , they would have sought asylum long before reaching australia .
all countries must have the right to decide who does or does not gain entry and citizenship .
illegal entry is exactly what it sounds like : illegal .
michael entill , uk all illegal immigration should be ended with tough measures all over the world mikko toivonen , finland i support fully the australian government policies on illegal immigrants .
i also support their right to starve if they so wish .
all illegal immigration should be ended with tough measures all over the world .
this should naturally exclude the real refugee that escapes for his life but also this should be restricted into nearest safe country .
not to the nearest economically prosperous country .
all illegals should be sent back to where they came from .
mikko toivonen , finland i think that everyone keeps forgetting that we are all inhabitants of the same planet .
unfortunately the resources of the world and the population of the world have not been distributed in a fair and equitable manner .
i believe it is only common sense for all countries to strive to reverse these inbalances and improve all peoples standards of living .
only then will can we have a chance of solving the problem of refugees .
anthony , australia australia is a big country , and most of its population are immigrants or descended from immigrants .
those who arrived from afghanistan had reason to fear for their lives , as subsequent events have proved .
could n't the resources now used for imprisonment be better devoted to education and integration of the 21st century immigrants ?
linda , uk the individual countries should decide who will enter their country al yendall , usa australia 's policy towards illegal immigrants is one that should be taken by all western countries .
the individual countries should decide who will enter their country .
al yendall , usa i expect the australian prime minister has seen what a laughing stock britain has become with its asylum seeker problem and is determined not to make the same mistake .
i think he has listened to what the people want .
jason , uk yes , australia 's tough immigration policy should continue .
stan johnson , canada i 'm absolutely disgusted at the behaviour of the australian government .
how can anyone in their right mind think that it is acceptable to lock up innocent men , women and children out in the middle of nowhere , in a desert , for up to 2 years in some cases ? !
the places the refugees come from are ruled by brutal tyrants and oppressive regimes -lrb- as we all know now after sept 11 -rrb- and to treat these refugees as prisoners and inmates is just inhuman !
rick stanford , uk just because economics and civil war in other countries make life unbearable for its inhabitants should not give them the automatic rights and citizenship to another prosperous country .
chris hannant , uk the government could break this cycle , by say , prime minister howard , minister ruddock arranging to meet strike leaders on neutral ground , and put this matter above partisan politicking .

a 15-day hunger strike staged by asylum seekers at a remote detention centre in australia has ended .
more than 240 asylum seekers - mainly afghans - abandoned their protest after the government promised to treat their claims to asylum in a more transparent fashion .
several detainees had been refusing food and water - and activists had warned the australian government it was only a matter of time before someone died .
prime minister john howard said his government 's tough immigration policies would not be watered down by the continued unrest .
should the government have given into the asylum seekers ' demands ?
were the asylum seekers right to carry out their hunger strike ?
this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the australian government is absolutely right in its tough stance against illegal immigrants .
í am also an afghan immigrant , but i did not gate crash into some country .
my whole family took refuge in pakistan for four years before being granted asylum in the us .
there is no guarantee that these illegal immigrants will not defy the law of the land even if they are given asylum .
they may continue to break the law in future and if convicted , may complain of discrimination .
dawood ibrahim , us the australian government 's treatment of refugees is shameful disgrace .
after the success of the sydney olympics and the good which that achievement did to australia on an international stage it is depressing to see such an ugly side to what is a beautiful country .
what 's even more depressing is that so many australian citizens appear to rabidly support such a morally bankrupt government .
jon , uk in these days of terrorism , they owe it to their people to be extremely cautious .
richard , us the australian government , as an elected representative of the australian people , has every right to determine who is let in the country .
and in these days of terrorism , they owe it to their people to be extremely cautious .
the western world can not take economic immigrants .
those whose lives are threatened by a current regime , must find asylum in the nearest country .
the others want a better economic life .
but common sense will tell you if a nation with its own culture and values gets swamped , those very values that created a well off society will be at risk .
the host country is rich because of its people , not the land they live on .
newcomers who adapt to the cultural and historical values of the country they go to , do much better than those who do n't .
but the question was : who has rights here , the australians represented by their government or the illegals .
the illegals have no rights .
richard , us surely people accept that a country -lrb- australia or otherwise -rrb- can only accept a finite amount of immigrants within a certain period of time .
those who are genuinely fleeing for their lives should be given priority over those who are fleeing for a better standard of living .
in order to do this you need to find out who these people are .
unfortunately , as has happened in the uk , may immigrants do a disappearing act before their claims can be processed .
so various governments are now using detention centres .
what would those who object to these centres suggest ?
that you allow unrestricted and unchecked entry for everyone who turns up ?
e. wilson , uk i am of the widely-held opinion that australia 's immigration policies are largely racist in motivation .
the government does not take anywhere near the same line when it comes to europeans who have overstayed their visas , or work illegally .
this is pointed out in newspaper editorials regularly .
these people may even outnumber the migrants from asia - i lived in australia on a youth-work exchange , and i can tell you for a fact that there are thousands of young people working illegally in sydney alone .
when they are found out they are certainly not put into concentration camps pending their expulsion .
matthew , usa i have been to australia and long before that seen what a great place it looks like .
so -lrb- being only a teenager at the time -rrb- i looked at their immigration policy with a view to emigrate when i was adult .
however if you check it out you will they no longer accept " £ 10 poms " .
for me -lrb- a british working university student -rrb- it is very hard to get in to , i would even have to take a language test - on my first language .
which is fair enough - why would they want to let me in if one million me 's want in .
so why should they be forced to make exceptions for asylum seekers whom on the whole do not speak english , have not got much work experience , and will more than likely be a burden to the australian economy rather than an addition ?
i know the usa -lrb- and the 51st state -rrb- likes to get involved with other countries , but that ¿ s no reason to force values on australia .
for the record i do hope to emigrate once i have a degree , about 8 years work experience , am still under 30 , and have the necessary funds .
it ca n't be one rule for some and another for others .
graham , uk australia has the second highest refugee intake per capita in the world .
chris hurst , uk / australia the fact that has been ignored in this whole situation is that australia has the second highest refugee intake per capita in the world .
no genuine refugee is ever refused entry into australia , and these refugees receive some of the best aid packages on offer in the world .
the australian government are correct to discourage people smugglers and queue jumpers from entering the country illegally , and should continue detaining asylum seekers and processing their claims properly before allowing them australian residency .
chris hurst , uk / australia a refugee is an individual who seeks asylum in the nearest safe country .
an immigrant picks and chooses a desired country to live and work in .
these people in the detention centres have chosen australia as their destination and therefore should be treated as immigrants , not refugees .
it 's as simple as that .
there are thousands of people from all parts of the world -lrb- not just white parts -rrb- who are waiting to immigrate to australia and have followed the correct legal procedures .
it would be unfair to them to allow people who have illegally entered the country with no documents , records or identification before them especially if they do n't meet the criteria set out for everyone .
indonesia has turned a blind eye to allow their progression to australia and has received virtually no criticism on this issue .
and what country in it 's right mind would be welcoming of an individual who sews his / her lips together to make a point ?
jeremy d , australia australia seems to feel immigrants are no longer to be made welcome in the country .
perhaps they should remember that australia is a nation of immigrants who stole the land from the aborigines and denied them many of their basic human rights .
the afghan refugees simply seek protection , and the right to share in australia 's culture - they have no desire to obliterate it and replace it with one of their own .
australia - look to your history .
you should be ashamed rachel uk no western country has had to absorb anything near the number of refugees that poor countries have to deal with dapo , uk australia 's policies are just plain disgraceful and inhumane .
no western country has had to absorb anything near the number of refugees that poor countries have to deal with .
iran , pakistan , tanzania etc have had to deal with millions -lrb- yes millions ! -rrb- of refugees each .
however rich countries like australia and the uk complain about the few thousands -lrb- no exaggeration -rrb- who come their way .
shame on you !
i ca n't believe that some people -lrb- e.g nic and chris b below -rrb- try to make a distinction between " indigenous australians " and the new asylum seekers .
i presume that the former does not just refer to the aboriginal population of australia .
the overwhelming majority -lrb- about 99 % -rrb- of australians are immigrants or descended from immigrants .
how can they complain about others who try to follow in their footsteps .
even if one assumes that the asylum seekers are just economic migrants is that a reason for treating them so badly ?
dapo , uk i think the australian government should either , immediately repatriate the asylum seekers as soon as they arrive illegally , or treat them in a more humane fashion and process their claims quicker , the camps are bad for everyone and have left the detainees in limbo , in a half world of non existence .
dave , hong kong the australian federal government are doing a good job , under the most trying conditions .
the people involved are no more then " queue jumpers " we take more then our fair share of refugees .
the government must make a stand and have a proper system of refugees coming into this country malcolm freeman , australia i think the australian government , and , by the tone of many preceding letters , a considerable number of the australian people , should be ashamed of their treatment and attitude toward the asylum seekers .
this reasoning would appear to be an unpleasant reflection of the discredited " whites only " policies which existed in australia not too long ago .
australia , like canada and the u.s. , were forged by immigrants and refugees of many origins , and we are the better for it .
the more the people of the world mix and intermarry , the more understanding will eventually prevail .
there will be no end to war , terrorism , or refugee crises as long as huge economic inequities exist .
in canada , we are under pressure from the " great bully " next door to align our policies with theirs in the wake of their recent events .
-lrb- yes , i have an interest in what happens in oz .
over the years two sisters , their families , and our parents went down-under -lrb- from britain -rrb- , both my daughters have visited and loved it -rrb- .
diana gallaway , canada what particularly bothers me in this whole situation is the impact upon the children involved .
from reports there are children in there who are without parents .
i fully agree with their request that they be placed into foster care while their cases are being examined .
woomera is no place for anyone , especially not kids .
erin j , france / australia our new immigration policy here in australia puts us in breach of our international obligations under the un 's convention relating to the status of refugees and its related protocol , the convention on the rights of the child , the international covenant on civil and political rights and the universal declaration of human rights .
why do australians have no qualms about violating these obligations ?
at least some of the blame must lie with our media .
during our recent election campaign 90 % of our newspaper editors told their readers that they should vote for howard despite , and in some instances because of , his immigration policies .
the murdochs , packers and other owners of mass media should be ashamed .
rainer mathews , australia i am so proud to be australian at the moment and i applaud the australia government shelley jones , australia / uk i am so proud to be australian at the moment and i applaud the australia government which , for once , is listening to what its national residents want .
for once we have a government that is listening .
no one demands a visa to get into a country - they stand in line like everyone else .
anyone who travels through several countries is not an asylum seeker .
these people have chosen to go to australia and should be grateful for the shelter and food they are receiving from australian tax payers ! ! !
shelley jones , australia / uk resident i have watched the way that australia has treated its refugees over the past year .
australian politicians deny that these concentration camps are prisons .
it 's true : they are not prisons .
real prison inmates are allowed to work for extra money , have access to real education , they are treated as individuals and they generally are not locked up with their children .
the only difference is that real prison inmates are guilty of a crime .
these poor asylum seekers have done nothing wrong except to try and save themselves and their children from the terror of the countries they have fled .
they would love to work in the australian community and earn their keep .
i love australia , i swore allegiance to it - a free choice on my part , but i feel ashamed .
it is not simply the government but the people who are generally in support of mistreating asylum seekers .
brendan , australia / uk i fully back the australian government in their decision not to be forced to change their policy just because some illegal immigrants are objecting .
as some of the other respondents have stated , the idea of asylum is that the asylum seeker goes to the nearest ' safe ' country .
to expect anyone to believe that the closest safe country to afghanistan is australia is plainly ludicrous .
the same thing can be said of the uk .
what the asylum seekers are doing is heading for the nearest big western country where they can have access to food , medicine and education way beyond what their own country has .
australia has recognised this and is refusing to give in .
if only the uk would do the same , and other european countries share the burden more fairly , then those of us who are subsidising more and more illegal immigrants might get some justice .
julia hopson , uk the government should decide their cases faster - say within a maximum of one year .
the savings made in food and upkeep and medical expenses could be directed to increasing the efficiency of the refugee acceptance system .
anyone waiting more than one year should be released while their case is being examined .
if they want to reject 99 % of them that is their decision but let them know either way within a year so they do n't suffer needlessly .
behrooz , iran of course the australian government is justified .
there may or may not be a case for considering some illegal entrants as political refugees and there may be grounds for granting residency on the basis of the economic contribution immigrants might make , but the simple facts are these .
firstly illegal entrants are not indigenous citizens .
they have human rights that should be respected , but not the right to freely move around before their status has been established - and there must be question marks over the legitimacy of people who seek political asylum having passed through at least one stable democratic country to reach australia .
secondly there is no automatic right of asylum , and many stable nations would be destabilised if the people of the world were allowed to cherry pick which nation they would like to settle in without there being good grounds for consideration .
thirdly , submitting to the demands of the asylum seekers where there are not good grounds for providing refuge is elitist because it is invariably the wealthy would-be immigrant who is able to travel half way round the world to seek asylum .
most people with genuine grounds for seeking asylum normally have insufficient means to make it further than the nearest border to their homes , if that .
nic , uk the refugee 's suffering is a shameful reflection of our own greed and fear .
gary lord , australia throughout my voting life , john howard 's liberal conservative party has shamefully manipulated a streak of latent xenophobia which survives in opposition to australia 's multicultural values .
the problem is not unique to australia , nor is the inhumane treatment of refugees .
if the western world ever makes serious efforts to improve life in the third world , these problems may disappear .
till then , the refugee 's suffering is a shameful reflection of our own greed and fear .
australia is a wealthy country with a strong multicultural tradition .
if we can not show compassion , who will ?
the irony is that while refugees eager to work are being kept at bay , australian papers are running articles about the impending retirement problems posed by an ageing population .
gary lord , australia i do n't see what gives us the " right " to detain these people - especially when they are then trapped and ca n't go forwards or backwards and do n't know how long they 'll be there and whether they 'll get a fair hearing .
while i enjoy my standard of living - i do n't expect my government to protect it by trampling on those fleeing poverty or persecution .
julian n , australia first of all , the debate about what is an illegal asylum seeker is a nonsense .
in countries such as pakistan and afghanistan , the police wo n't even let people into the compound of the australian consulate , let alone hand them out asylum applications .
the conditions to apply for asylum are so appalling that the only option for those desperate to flee is to pay dodgy ' people-smugglers ' .
this does not make their case any less compassionate than bona-fide asylum seekers .
in fact , if anything , theirs is probably the more desperate lot .
second , many asylum seekers come -lrb- or are coming -rrb- from countries where the west has fought proxy wars .
afghanistan is the most recent example .
iraq is another case .
it is about time we realise that these are chickens coming home to roost .
azhar ali abidi , australia it is hypocritical of the howard government to have supported the coalition war in afghanistan and then to treat afghani refugees inhumanely by incarcerating them in remote detention centres such as the desert , and pacific islands offshore .
their contempt for political democracy is evident by journalists repeated being denied access to asylum seekers .
anna schlusser , australia i recently went on a hunger strike in solidarity with the hunger strikers in woomera tamara , sydney , australia people keep talking about " protecting borders " - protect our borders from what ? people fleeing for their life on sinking ships ?
there is so much i 'd love to say about this issue , especially in response to some of the extremely naive comments already posted , which go to show the extent to which so many people have swallowed the government 's racist and uniformed propaganda .
i recently went on a hunger strike in solidarity with the hunger strikers in woomera , and i believe all camps should be closed , and refugees ' passage to australia should be assisted .
tamara , sydney , australia i am astounded by the lack of compassion displayed here .
many of those first ' safe ' countries that the refugees arrive at have enough problems of their own , and no spare cash to deal with them .
if the shoe was on the other foot , all these people who are quick to condemn these unlucky refugees would also go to the first economically prosperous country themselves - it is a perfectly understandable act .
it is certainly in australia 's ' self-interest ' to treat these refugees they way they do , but does n't this kind of reasoning make it difficult to hold one 's head up high ?
hannah , uk i am a british migrant in australia .
i have grown to love this country and the generosity of its people .
yes australians are all ultimately migrants themselves , but they are also intelligent people .
it is clear to them that they are being blackmailed by a group of people who have come to australia to take advantage of this generosity .
if they wanted safety why did n't they stay in indonesia ?
it 's infinitely more safe than afghanistan .
they are economic migrants , and the australian people know this and know they are being blackmailed .
howard and ruddock are simply doing what any sensible politician does - following the will of the majority electorate .
iain , australia i fully support the howard government 's decision on illegal immigrants .
australia has long been seen as one of the most multi-cultural countries in the world .
it continues to lead by allowing substantial numbers of refugees on par with our population - australia lets in the second highest amount of refugees per population .
while these people are leaving countries of desitution , to be a legal refugee under u.n status you must claim for refugee status in the first country you arrive in .
these illegal immigrants have come through many countries including pakistan and indonesia to illegally enter australia .
these people are not true refugees but instead people who have the money to afford these passages to where they wish to live .
people who sew theirs and their children ¿ s lips together , stage violent protests and send their children alone on this arduous journey across the sea in order to claim family status have no right to be in australia , where violent protests and child abuse are seen as a disgrace .
this moral blackmail must stop , and australia is simply protecting its democratic right to allow people of our choice to enter this country , while they do not claim refugee status .
detentions such as woomera have been highly criticised but a independent tribunal has recently declared the conditions in wommera to be extremely good .
children are taken to local schools ; air conditioning and comfortable lodgings , as well as numerous leisure activities are supplied .
many facilities continue to be built but are constantly being destroyed by these violent protests .
congratulations mr howard and keep protecting our democratic rights .
ed , australia it seems that many forget people that australia 's location puts it in a more precarious position with the developing world .
northern europeans can afford be sanctimonious about the refugee " crisis " because there is no danger of them being inundated by people seeking to improve their economic conditions .
what we all need to do , regardless of nation , is find ways to cure the endemic poverty and violence of these countries .
accepting economic refugees will always be a band aid solution .
richard henman , canada what happened to the policy that the refugees must seek refuge in the first country outside the one they are fleeing .
charles , usa why are the refugees australia 's responsibility .
what happened to the policy that the refugees must seek refuge in the first country outside the one they are fleeing ?
the refugees are not entitled to " pick and choose " their country of residence .
afghan refugees have passed through indonesia and other countries .
any one of these countries could have processed there claims , but the refugees refused to stay .
they demand australia .
the same thing is happening in the uk .
the afghan refugees have passed through turkey and western europe and demand residence in the uk .
why ?
charles , usa howard should be immediately put in a detention centre for committing crimes against humanity in his illegal and uncompassionate treatment of both aborigines and asylum seekers .
and to those australians who agree with his racist policies - do n't forget that the majority of you are the descendants of economic refugees from europe , who did n't even ask for permission to live in australia .
you should be ashamed of yourselves .
scott hemphill , germany -lrb- ex australia -rrb- australia has always made it clear it puts people who illegally enter it 's country in detention centres , so why do people who illegally enter the country complain ?
louise o 'brien , australia do n't get the australian public 's attitude confused with that of the government .
before people talk about " australia 's attitude " or " australia 's inhumanity " etc. they should keep in mind that the australian public is deeply divided on this issue .
there are more people against the government than most people think .
things have changed since the election last year .
michael , australia to be allowed to stay there whilst the situation is sorted out is something to be grateful for .
chris b , england australia belongs to australians - so let them run their country as they see fit and let 's cut out this holier than thou attitude .
whilst i do n't necessarily agree with john howard 's attitude , he is possibly learning from the mistakes made by other countries , some of whose immigration policies might be considered a little too relaxed .
i believe that genuinely displaced individuals whose life is endangered should be offered immediate sanctuary elsewhere - but i am also aware that this particular band wagon will grow as big as any host country allows it to become .
the fact is , australia 's asylum seekers are at least being held in australia , when they might easily have been turned round and sent straight back to where they came from .
to arrive unannounced en-masse in a foreign country and expect an automatic right to be given immediate citizenship is unreasonable - so to be allowed to stay there whilst the situation is sorted out is something to be grateful for .
if people want to arrive in australia and promptly protest about the way it is run , by refusing food , then let them .
they 're probably getting their first taste of what democratic rights are about .
moreover , a hunger strike is reducing the australian government 's expenses incurred on the asylum seekers ' behalf .
if you enter a foreign country by breaking its rules , the least you can do is keep your head down and do as you 're told thereafter .
chris b , england a state granting asylum is entitled to grant it on its own terms , subject to the observation of basic human rights .
asylum seekers are in no position to demand anything .
if i were that desperate to leave my own country i would be willing to accept any terms of a state willing to allow me food water shelter and a lack of torture .
phil , uk it must be remembered that australians have a working immigration policy that offers residence to tens of thousands of potential immigrants every year .
this includes a quota intended for legitimate refugees facing persecution , in varying forms , the world over .
this policy requires due course , and formal process in order that a fair and equitable allocation of positions is adhered to .
simply jumping to the front of the queue is not acceptable .
i know of no country on the planet that willingly allows free movement by unauthorised foreigners across its borders .
that is tantamount to chaos .
for better or worse we currently reside on a planet that is divided into neo political boundaries , this is the actuality , for a civilised society to grow , it must first establish internal security , this is achieved by the creation of laws and policies .
australia has a well thought out , equitable and just immigration policy and we have a duty not to be deterred from this policy by a handful of extortionate asylum seekers .
adam , australia we are hardly being swamped in comparison to the uk , pakistan or indonesia s clarkson , australia i 'm ashamed of australia 's current policies because they are race based .
currently we have over 60,000 illegal over-stayers here in australia mainly from the us and the uk .
almost no effort is made to police and deport these illegals .
at the same time we are spending millions to imprison and degrade men women and children , most of whom are eventually proven to be bona-fide refugees for long periods of time .
there are million of refugees in the world yet australia gets approx .
4000 uninvited refugees per year - we are hardly being swamped in comparison to the uk , pakistan or indonesia .
we do n't treat or punish all our uninvited equally and until we do other are justified in pointing the finger of reproach at us .
s clarkson , australia the afghans in question fled their own country to escape what the west has subsequently branded a terrorist regime , and successfully evicted at the cost of a great deal of money and a great number of lives .
i do n't understand how we feel able to outlaw a state on the one hand , and refuse to shelter dissidents escaping from that state on the other .
why should afghan refugees go back to help " rebuild " their country ?
their country has been demolished by the actions of another state , over which they had no influence or control .
they are n't responsible - why do n't the people who made the mess take responsibility for their actions and clear it up ?
we might have won our own fictitious little war , but that does n't mean that afghanistan is suddenly a democracy .
personally , i think that those of us who enjoy the political and economic advantages of life in western democracies have an obligation to support escapees from other regimes whose actions we 're happy to criticise from afar .
and yes , australia is a nation of immigrants , like britain , and look what the current defenders of the nation did to the original inhabitants .
stella hawkins , u.k. the australian government is entirely justified in it 's actions .
their first duty is to protect the safety and continued prosperity of those who are in australia legally .
were howard to give in to what amounts to nothing other than emotional blackmail then they would be failing in that duty .
james , england -lrb- australian by birth -rrb- the australian pm talks about open door policy - that would be immigrants should apply through the front door .
that statement alone tells volumes ; welcome if you are white and from the right sort of country , otherwise do n't bother .
i would like to see the australian pm spend a few days living in the camp in naro , then i might take his opinion seriously .
if australia wants to avail itself of international law and international funds , then it should also uphold international law .
as it stands , it has acted illegally , irresponsibly and unethically and the people should be ashamed of themselves and their government .
i for one would never visit or invest in australia or anyone from that country .
janeen , usa as far as i am concerned anybody who claims asylum should be housed and fed in safety and comfort in closest safe country to the one of origin , i.e. if you arrive in australia from afghanistan via several other countries including malaysia -lrb- which has an islamic culture and is safe -rrb- then you must be an economic migrant rather than a bona fide asylum seeker .
we in the uk are soft on immigration and it will hurt us in the long run as our cultural heritage becomes devalued .
if we need people to boost our economy we should do what the gulf states do and issue fixed term work permits which are cancelled at the end of the period and you have to leave that country .
basically 99 % of asylum seekers are economic migrants .
andy , uk lucky for all those people from the " civilized " world that all indians , american natives , aborigines etc , did not have " immigration policies " at the time .
otherwise they would have seen first hand how it is to live in misery and not be able to do anything about it .
the only reason these " developed " nations are doing so well now is because they had free access to land and resources the world over , with no one telling them " go back where you came from " .
i think people should study a bit more of their very bloody history and then just shut up rather than coming up with moral stances .
paul , uk / romania the response of the australian politicians and people are as expected .
this is the normal response of most people in all countries .
the difference is that the australians are open about their choice .
no other country had the opportunity to vote in a government on the single issue of immigrants .
if they had the outcome would be the same .
it is simply a characteristic of human nature that can only be overcome by deep thinking , reasoning and compassion .
clearly howard , the australians and most of the world have along way to go before rising above the caveman mind-set .
until then we truly are just naked apes dressed in suits with a fierce sense of superiority .
ken , switzerland australia like all countries has a legal procedure for asylum application .
those who arrive illegally and destroy their personal documents prior to arrival should expect to have a lengthy visa application .
these people should apply through the regular channels like all who seem asylum or migration .
ken , turkey people who sew their children 's lips together , attack guards , commit arson may attract lawyers , the media and do-gooders like moths to light but violently demanding visa 's rather than asking does n't get much sympathy from the average aussie. al greer , australia the asylums seekers are definitely right to carry out their hunger strike .
those from afghanistan have suffered for 23 years and at the moment they suffer in australia , but the australian government does n't care about them .
they should n't be blamed , the international community could blame australia for not treating them as refugees .
khaaled hamza , united kingdom i strongly believe in australia 's immigration policy .
all eu countries should officially agree to follow a similar pattern .
nicolas a. , uk the australian government is totally justified in its actions john o 'connor , eire i think the australian government is totally justified in its actions .
these people are just using unrest in their country to enter a prosperous country , if they were proper refugees they would have stayed in the nearest safe country .
john o 'connor , eire jackie mckerrell , clearly is n't in touch with " the larger australian community " .
the reality is , the vast majority of australian 's strongly support the action taken by the howard government .
just because a few hundred people are very vocal in their opposition to australia 's policy towards illegal immigrants , it does n't mean that the rest of the community feels the same .
unlike many other democratic countries , our government takes actions that reflect the views of the majority , not the vocal " bleeding heart " minority .
ben kerr , perth , australia i am really shocked that people from other countries are condoning the inhumane and indefensible treatment of asylum seekers and refugees .
they are not illegal migrants , it is not illegal to arrive in a country and ask for asylum .
i 'm disappointed that the bbc is constantly reporting the protests by the refugees but failing to mention the mounting protests and actions by the larger australian community - from non governmental bodies to school kids taking over the ground floor of the immigration department in melbourne .
jackie mckerrell , australia as an afghan i express my great gratitude to britain , which has granted refugee status to our poor people who have suffered since 23 years of continues war .
australia does n't have human feelings .
khaaled hamza , afghanistan well , as there is no reason left for them to seek asylum , they should go back to afghanistan and contribute to what 's going on there .
i totally supported australia 's stance on this issue from the beginning - these " asylum seekers " were trouble from the get-go !
mark m. newdick , us / uk how refreshing to see a democratic country stands by its decisions on immigration , despite all the pressures from the uninformed .
michael evans , uk it is what happens when we have a prime minister who was in politics in the 60s and who gives the impression that he is still thinking with the mentality of that time , and he has been " milking as much as he could at the last elections , playing on the people phobias .
as far as the political landscape is concerned , only the " greens " have taken a stance against this sort of attitude and they have doubled their national vote while the " democrats " lost ground in their " wishy-washy " attitude .
things are changing and the australian people are not what their government tend to portray to the world .
john f , australia the australian government is right to stick to its ' policy on asylum seekers a. byfield , uk the australian government is right to stick to its ' policy on asylum seekers .
these people should be eager to get back to help rebuild their country instead of engaging in psychological blackmail against australia .
a. byfield , uk it is in australia 's best interest to keep its tough immigration policies .
mark , canada australians have forgotten their migrant roots .
they have now become more old world than the europeans in their attitudes and that is nothing to celebrate .
shame on australia and its people .
kevin brown , scotland howard is merely obeying the electorate 's wishes which were made very clear during the last election .
to deviate from this course would be totally undemocratic .
besides , the asylum seekers stopped in indonesia first where they were perfectly safe - their subsequent voyage to australia simply makes them illegal immigrants .
james s , australia the bleating british political class should put their money where their mouth is and offer to take these people into the uk .
then you can view first hand the sort of repugnant media stunts that disgusts this nation .
ross mackenzie , australia australia 's stance is justified .
if these were genuine ' refugees ' , they would have sought asylum long before reaching australia .
all countries must have the right to decide who does or does not gain entry and citizenship .
illegal entry is exactly what it sounds like : illegal .
michael entill , uk all illegal immigration should be ended with tough measures all over the world mikko toivonen , finland i support fully the australian government policies on illegal immigrants .
i also support their right to starve if they so wish .
all illegal immigration should be ended with tough measures all over the world .
this should naturally exclude the real refugee that escapes for his life but also this should be restricted into nearest safe country .
not to the nearest economically prosperous country .
all illegals should be sent back to where they came from .
mikko toivonen , finland i think that everyone keeps forgetting that we are all inhabitants of the same planet .
unfortunately the resources of the world and the population of the world have not been distributed in a fair and equitable manner .
i believe it is only common sense for all countries to strive to reverse these inbalances and improve all peoples standards of living .
only then will can we have a chance of solving the problem of refugees .
anthony , australia australia is a big country , and most of its population are immigrants or descended from immigrants .
those who arrived from afghanistan had reason to fear for their lives , as subsequent events have proved .
could n't the resources now used for imprisonment be better devoted to education and integration of the 21st century immigrants ?
linda , uk the individual countries should decide who will enter their country al yendall , usa australia 's policy towards illegal immigrants is one that should be taken by all western countries .
the individual countries should decide who will enter their country .
al yendall , usa i expect the australian prime minister has seen what a laughing stock britain has become with its asylum seeker problem and is determined not to make the same mistake .
i think he has listened to what the people want .
jason , uk yes , australia 's tough immigration policy should continue .
stan johnson , canada i 'm absolutely disgusted at the behaviour of the australian government .
how can anyone in their right mind think that it is acceptable to lock up innocent men , women and children out in the middle of nowhere , in a desert , for up to 2 years in some cases ? !
the places the refugees come from are ruled by brutal tyrants and oppressive regimes -lrb- as we all know now after sept 11 -rrb- and to treat these refugees as prisoners and inmates is just inhuman !
rick stanford , uk just because economics and civil war in other countries make life unbearable for its inhabitants should not give them the automatic rights and citizenship to another prosperous country .
chris hannant , uk the government could break this cycle , by say , prime minister howard , minister ruddock arranging to meet strike leaders on neutral ground , and put this matter above partisan politicking .
