i 'm trying to address clichés about jewish life in germany and trying to show what modern life is like here in berlin .
often it is only seen as something religious or something related to synagogues or klezmer music .
i tried to break down these clichés . the film follows the dating adventures of dahila and leah .
on their first blind date , both end up at a klezmer concert with two very different dates .

how do such attitudes affect dating in germany ? the film is based on personal experience and many experiences of friends , where supposedly everything was fine being with a non-jew .

the un intervention comes at a time when the european union is set to decide the island 's case for eu membership at a crucial summit in copenhagen in december .
at the summit , the eu is expected to welcome cyprus and nine other candidate countries to discuss the next steps towards membership and will decide whether the island should join the eu as a whole or only the greek cypriot part .
turkey threatens action if cyprus joins eu first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is an island split by bitter feuding .
however , storm clouds are gathering as turkey has threatened to annex the north of the island if a decision to admit cyprus to the eu is made before turkey has been allowed to join .
turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash remains adamantly opposed to the island 's accession unless turkey is a member , saying the greeks would exploit their eu membership to undermine turkey 's claim to the island or any future power sharing compromise .
greece will veto enlargement if cyprus is excluded for its part , greece has said that it will veto the planned eu expansion if cyprus is excluded from the list of candidate states .
the greek cypriots have applied for eu membership on behalf of the entire island , a move that has only added further fuel to the already blazing row .
" there are going to be some very difficult negotiations ahead , " greece 's eu affairs minister , tassos giannitsis , told the british daily the guardian .
" the question of sovereignty , and how to create a functional working state that can deal with the eu , is ultimately the most important thing we are going to have to deal with . "
there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash have big decisions ahead .
costas simits , the greek premier , called the initiative a ' ' starting point for further negotiations , " stressing that the eu must be satisfied with any final solution .
simitis is expected to meet with the cypriot president galfcos clerides next saturday to discuss the plan in detail .
tensions across cyprus have been rife ever since turkey invaded the north of the island in response to an athens-inspired coup in 1974 .
there are still 35,000 turkish troops stationed on the northern half of the island , and more than 1,000 united nations soldiers manning the green line , which separates the two halves of the island and splits the capital of nicosia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talking peace on cyprus leaders of both sides of the divided island pledge to meet three times a week in the coming weeks to resolve a host of disputes as eu membership looms .

the un intervention comes at a time when the european union is set to decide the island 's case for eu membership at a crucial summit in copenhagen in december .
at the summit , the eu is expected to welcome cyprus and nine other candidate countries to discuss the next steps towards membership and will decide whether the island should join the eu as a whole or only the greek cypriot part .
turkey threatens action if cyprus joins eu first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is an island split by bitter feuding .
however , storm clouds are gathering as turkey has threatened to annex the north of the island if a decision to admit cyprus to the eu is made before turkey has been allowed to join .
turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash remains adamantly opposed to the island 's accession unless turkey is a member , saying the greeks would exploit their eu membership to undermine turkey 's claim to the island or any future power sharing compromise .
greece will veto enlargement if cyprus is excluded for its part , greece has said that it will veto the planned eu expansion if cyprus is excluded from the list of candidate states .
the greek cypriots have applied for eu membership on behalf of the entire island , a move that has only added further fuel to the already blazing row .
" there are going to be some very difficult negotiations ahead , " greece 's eu affairs minister , tassos giannitsis , told the british daily the guardian .
" the question of sovereignty , and how to create a functional working state that can deal with the eu , is ultimately the most important thing we are going to have to deal with . "
there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash have big decisions ahead .
costas simits , the greek premier , called the initiative a ' ' starting point for further negotiations , " stressing that the eu must be satisfied with any final solution .
simitis is expected to meet with the cypriot president galfcos clerides next saturday to discuss the plan in detail .
tensions across cyprus have been rife ever since turkey invaded the north of the island in response to an athens-inspired coup in 1974 .
there are still 35,000 turkish troops stationed on the northern half of the island , and more than 1,000 united nations soldiers manning the green line , which separates the two halves of the island and splits the capital of nicosia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talking peace on cyprus leaders of both sides of the divided island pledge to meet three times a week in the coming weeks to resolve a host of disputes as eu membership looms .

television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telling smokers their habit kills is like preaching to the converted as the eu continues to spread its anti-smoking message across the continent , the german government recently insisted that tobacco companies must no longer mislead smokers with claims that their products are ' light ' or less dangerous for them .

television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .

putin struck a deal with the european union on kaliningrad , due to be surrounded by eu countries after the accession of the ten candidate states , removing a serious obstacle to the biggest ever enlargement of the european union in 2004 .
the russian president gave the green light to the hard- fought agreement which will see the issue of a multiple-entry transit document for travel to all kaliningrad residents from next july .
another seperate document will allow for trips by train .
the agreement was reached despite extensive last-minute haggling by the russians .
the danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen currently in charge of the rotating eu presidency , told the british daily the guardian that the " strategic partnership " between russia and the eu had " found the right balance between all the interests involved " .
the agreement provides access for the enclave 's 1.5m-strong russian population to the russian mainland once the eu is enlarged to the east .
russians wanted unhindered access to enclave president putin had previously insisted that residents of kaliningrad should be able to travel freely to and from the russian mainland through the prospective eu countries of poland and lithuania , should eu enlargement go ahead without any further problems .

the eu had rejected russian proposals earlier in the year fearing that the crime-riddled enclave might export its notorious drug trafficking and smuggling to the prospective member states .

eu - russian relations have warmed considerably over the past two years . only last week president putin was granted one of his main wishes with the eu formally recognizing russia as a market economy , thus easing the way for it to export more to western europe and join the world trade organization .

at the end of the summit , the combined statement put out on the subject was described as ' tepid ' .
the eu and russia both condemned terrorism without commenting specifically on chechnya .

putin struck a deal with the european union on kaliningrad , due to be surrounded by eu countries after the accession of the ten candidate states , removing a serious obstacle to the biggest ever enlargement of the european union in 2004 .
the russian president gave the green light to the hard- fought agreement which will see the issue of a multiple-entry transit document for travel to all kaliningrad residents from next july .
another seperate document will allow for trips by train .
the agreement was reached despite extensive last-minute haggling by the russians .
the danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen currently in charge of the rotating eu presidency , told the british daily the guardian that the " strategic partnership " between russia and the eu had " found the right balance between all the interests involved " .
the agreement provides access for the enclave 's 1.5m-strong russian population to the russian mainland once the eu is enlarged to the east .
russians wanted unhindered access to enclave president putin had previously insisted that residents of kaliningrad should be able to travel freely to and from the russian mainland through the prospective eu countries of poland and lithuania , should eu enlargement go ahead without any further problems .

the eu had rejected russian proposals earlier in the year fearing that the crime-riddled enclave might export its notorious drug trafficking and smuggling to the prospective member states .
the russians responded angrily , claiming the eu rules requiring the enclave 's one million citizens to have visas to travel to the rest of russia would be ' humiliating ' .
eu compromise satisfactory for russia now , russia has accepted the eu 's compromise of the " kaliningrad pass " , which will allow frequent travelers to reach mainland russia without a conventional visa .
eu - russian relations have warmed considerably over the past two years . only last week president putin was granted one of his main wishes with the eu formally recognizing russia as a market economy , thus easing the way for it to export more to western europe and join the world trade organization .
official sources hinted that the announcement was deliberately timed to improve the atmosphere of the brussels summit .

at the end of the summit , the combined statement put out on the subject was described as ' tepid ' .

the film premieres on tuesday at berlin 's kino arsenal as part of a cultural festival sponsored by the jewish community of berlin . dahlia is straight and culturally jewish .
leah is lesbian and religious .

i 'm trying to address clichés about jewish life in germany and trying to show what modern life is like here in berlin .
often it is only seen as something religious or something related to synagogues or klezmer music .
i tried to break down these clichés . the film follows the dating adventures of dahila and leah .
on their first blind date , both end up at a klezmer concert with two very different dates .
on the one hand , there 's a visiting american jewish journalist who 's trying to find out about jewish life in germany .
he takes dahlia there .
he thinks , ' wow , what a thriving jewish community . '
even though none of the musicians are jewish and nobody in the audience is jewish .

she says she 's jewish , but she 's jewish because something like her grandmother 's father 's ex-husband was jewish .

that was the only requirement , we could choose which genre we wanted my first impulse was to make something very modern .
i was tired of only seeing jewish topics presented in a historical context .
i wanted something in color , not in black-and-white .
something about our lives here and now , not a story that 's only centered on the holocaust .
i wanted to attempt to reflect something of my generation .
to take a universal theme – love - and show what different realities we have . a recent study found that 22 percent of germans believe that jews have too much influence in germany , and 17 percent believe that jews are responsible for their own persecution .
how do such attitudes affect dating in germany ? the film is based on personal experience and many experiences of friends , where supposedly everything was fine being with a non-jew .
but then at some point some really harsh things came out that were maybe not anti-semitic , but were about not being able to relate or feeling alienated on some level . are the concerns the same for homosexuals and heterosexuals ? it 's the same .
that 's the point .
they both experience these kinds of impossible people . … but there 's a happy ending . berlin beschert is the precursor of a longer film you have in the works .
what can we expect from the longer film ? i want to address relations going on right now between jewish and non-jewish germans .
there are so many extremes that people get caught between .
there 's the phenomenon of philo-semitism , where everything jewish is trendy and good .

the un intervention comes at a time when the european union is set to decide the island 's case for eu membership at a crucial summit in copenhagen in december .
at the summit , the eu is expected to welcome cyprus and nine other candidate countries to discuss the next steps towards membership and will decide whether the island should join the eu as a whole or only the greek cypriot part .
turkey threatens action if cyprus joins eu first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is an island split by bitter feuding .
however , storm clouds are gathering as turkey has threatened to annex the north of the island if a decision to admit cyprus to the eu is made before turkey has been allowed to join .
turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash remains adamantly opposed to the island 's accession unless turkey is a member , saying the greeks would exploit their eu membership to undermine turkey 's claim to the island or any future power sharing compromise .
greece will veto enlargement if cyprus is excluded for its part , greece has said that it will veto the planned eu expansion if cyprus is excluded from the list of candidate states .
the greek cypriots have applied for eu membership on behalf of the entire island , a move that has only added further fuel to the already blazing row .
" there are going to be some very difficult negotiations ahead , " greece 's eu affairs minister , tassos giannitsis , told the british daily the guardian .
" the question of sovereignty , and how to create a functional working state that can deal with the eu , is ultimately the most important thing we are going to have to deal with . "
there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash have big decisions ahead .
costas simits , the greek premier , called the initiative a ' ' starting point for further negotiations , " stressing that the eu must be satisfied with any final solution .
simitis is expected to meet with the cypriot president galfcos clerides next saturday to discuss the plan in detail .
tensions across cyprus have been rife ever since turkey invaded the north of the island in response to an athens-inspired coup in 1974 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.11.2002 eu anti-smoking campaign from the stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young smokers are about to hear the ' anti ' message from their heroes the eu has enlisted the help of celebrities from entertainment and sport in its initiative that seeks to educate young people on the dangers of smoking . the european commission 's " feel free to say no " anti-smoking initiative received a boost this week when stars from music and sport joined the campaign in a bid to help young people resist the temptations and pressures surrounding the habit .
television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.11.2002 un cyprus deadline sets eu on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan hopes to reunite the two sides of cyprus permanently the un has given the warring factions on the island of cyprus one month to come to a peaceful solution to the island 's sovereignty or risk a permanent divide that could have serious repercussions for the eu . un secretary general kofi annan has given cyprus one month to achieve peace and consolidate the two divided sides of the island that has been a scene of unrest and violence for the past 28 years .
the un intervention comes at a time when the european union is set to decide the island 's case for eu membership at a crucial summit in copenhagen in december .
at the summit , the eu is expected to welcome cyprus and nine other candidate countries to discuss the next steps towards membership and will decide whether the island should join the eu as a whole or only the greek cypriot part .
turkey threatens action if cyprus joins eu first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is an island split by bitter feuding .
however , storm clouds are gathering as turkey has threatened to annex the north of the island if a decision to admit cyprus to the eu is made before turkey has been allowed to join .
turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash remains adamantly opposed to the island 's accession unless turkey is a member , saying the greeks would exploit their eu membership to undermine turkey 's claim to the island or any future power sharing compromise .
greece will veto enlargement if cyprus is excluded for its part , greece has said that it will veto the planned eu expansion if cyprus is excluded from the list of candidate states .
the greek cypriots have applied for eu membership on behalf of the entire island , a move that has only added further fuel to the already blazing row .
" there are going to be some very difficult negotiations ahead , " greece 's eu affairs minister , tassos giannitsis , told the british daily the guardian .
" the question of sovereignty , and how to create a functional working state that can deal with the eu , is ultimately the most important thing we are going to have to deal with . "
there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash have big decisions ahead .
costas simits , the greek premier , called the initiative a ' ' starting point for further negotiations , " stressing that the eu must be satisfied with any final solution .

television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telling smokers their habit kills is like preaching to the converted as the eu continues to spread its anti-smoking message across the continent , the german government recently insisted that tobacco companies must no longer mislead smokers with claims that their products are ' light ' or less dangerous for them .

putin struck a deal with the european union on kaliningrad , due to be surrounded by eu countries after the accession of the ten candidate states , removing a serious obstacle to the biggest ever enlargement of the european union in 2004 .
the russian president gave the green light to the hard- fought agreement which will see the issue of a multiple-entry transit document for travel to all kaliningrad residents from next july .
another seperate document will allow for trips by train .
the agreement was reached despite extensive last-minute haggling by the russians .
the danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen currently in charge of the rotating eu presidency , told the british daily the guardian that the " strategic partnership " between russia and the eu had " found the right balance between all the interests involved " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.11.2002 eu anti-smoking campaign from the stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young smokers are about to hear the ' anti ' message from their heroes the eu has enlisted the help of celebrities from entertainment and sport in its initiative that seeks to educate young people on the dangers of smoking . the european commission 's " feel free to say no " anti-smoking initiative received a boost this week when stars from music and sport joined the campaign in a bid to help young people resist the temptations and pressures surrounding the habit .
television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telling smokers their habit kills is like preaching to the converted as the eu continues to spread its anti-smoking message across the continent , the german government recently insisted that tobacco companies must no longer mislead smokers with claims that their products are ' light ' or less dangerous for them .
new regulations will force the tobacco companies to update their health warnings by adding the gruesomely truthful , although ultimately futile , information that ' smoking kills ' - a fact most smokers are fully aware of . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just say no the european football association and the european union have teamed up to try to get young people to say " no " to tobacco .

to take a universal theme – love - and show what different realities we have . a recent study found that 22 percent of germans believe that jews have too much influence in germany , and 17 percent believe that jews are responsible for their own persecution .
how do such attitudes affect dating in germany ? the film is based on personal experience and many experiences of friends , where supposedly everything was fine being with a non-jew .

in her first short feature film , " berlin beshert , " she follows the dating experiences of two jewish sisters in berlin .
the film premieres on tuesday at berlin 's kino arsenal as part of a cultural festival sponsored by the jewish community of berlin . dahlia is straight and culturally jewish .
leah is lesbian and religious .
both are searching for a soulmate -lrb- " beshert " in yiddish -rrb- in order to avoid their mother 's threat of taking them to a matchmaker for arranged marriages . dw-world caught up with the filmmaker in berlin . your film is about jewish singles in berlin .
what are the main issues you address ? it 's a satire .
that 's important .
i 'm trying to address clichés about jewish life in germany and trying to show what modern life is like here in berlin .
often it is only seen as something religious or something related to synagogues or klezmer music .
i tried to break down these clichés . the film follows the dating adventures of dahila and leah .
on their first blind date , both end up at a klezmer concert with two very different dates .
on the one hand , there 's a visiting american jewish journalist who 's trying to find out about jewish life in germany .
he takes dahlia there .
he thinks , ' wow , what a thriving jewish community . '
even though none of the musicians are jewish and nobody in the audience is jewish .

the un intervention comes at a time when the european union is set to decide the island 's case for eu membership at a crucial summit in copenhagen in december .
at the summit , the eu is expected to welcome cyprus and nine other candidate countries to discuss the next steps towards membership and will decide whether the island should join the eu as a whole or only the greek cypriot part .
turkey threatens action if cyprus joins eu first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is an island split by bitter feuding .
however , storm clouds are gathering as turkey has threatened to annex the north of the island if a decision to admit cyprus to the eu is made before turkey has been allowed to join .
turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash remains adamantly opposed to the island 's accession unless turkey is a member , saying the greeks would exploit their eu membership to undermine turkey 's claim to the island or any future power sharing compromise .
greece will veto enlargement if cyprus is excluded for its part , greece has said that it will veto the planned eu expansion if cyprus is excluded from the list of candidate states .
the greek cypriots have applied for eu membership on behalf of the entire island , a move that has only added further fuel to the already blazing row .
" there are going to be some very difficult negotiations ahead , " greece 's eu affairs minister , tassos giannitsis , told the british daily the guardian .
" the question of sovereignty , and how to create a functional working state that can deal with the eu , is ultimately the most important thing we are going to have to deal with . "
there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash have big decisions ahead .
costas simits , the greek premier , called the initiative a ' ' starting point for further negotiations , " stressing that the eu must be satisfied with any final solution .
simitis is expected to meet with the cypriot president galfcos clerides next saturday to discuss the plan in detail .
tensions across cyprus have been rife ever since turkey invaded the north of the island in response to an athens-inspired coup in 1974 .
there are still 35,000 turkish troops stationed on the northern half of the island , and more than 1,000 united nations soldiers manning the green line , which separates the two halves of the island and splits the capital of nicosia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talking peace on cyprus leaders of both sides of the divided island pledge to meet three times a week in the coming weeks to resolve a host of disputes as eu membership looms .

there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "

the un intervention comes at a time when the european union is set to decide the island 's case for eu membership at a crucial summit in copenhagen in december .
at the summit , the eu is expected to welcome cyprus and nine other candidate countries to discuss the next steps towards membership and will decide whether the island should join the eu as a whole or only the greek cypriot part .
turkey threatens action if cyprus joins eu first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is an island split by bitter feuding .
however , storm clouds are gathering as turkey has threatened to annex the north of the island if a decision to admit cyprus to the eu is made before turkey has been allowed to join .
turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash remains adamantly opposed to the island 's accession unless turkey is a member , saying the greeks would exploit their eu membership to undermine turkey 's claim to the island or any future power sharing compromise .
greece will veto enlargement if cyprus is excluded for its part , greece has said that it will veto the planned eu expansion if cyprus is excluded from the list of candidate states .
the greek cypriots have applied for eu membership on behalf of the entire island , a move that has only added further fuel to the already blazing row .
" there are going to be some very difficult negotiations ahead , " greece 's eu affairs minister , tassos giannitsis , told the british daily the guardian .
" the question of sovereignty , and how to create a functional working state that can deal with the eu , is ultimately the most important thing we are going to have to deal with . "

television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telling smokers their habit kills is like preaching to the converted as the eu continues to spread its anti-smoking message across the continent , the german government recently insisted that tobacco companies must no longer mislead smokers with claims that their products are ' light ' or less dangerous for them .
new regulations will force the tobacco companies to update their health warnings by adding the gruesomely truthful , although ultimately futile , information that ' smoking kills ' - a fact most smokers are fully aware of . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just say no the european football association and the european union have teamed up to try to get young people to say " no " to tobacco .

television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telling smokers their habit kills is like preaching to the converted as the eu continues to spread its anti-smoking message across the continent , the german government recently insisted that tobacco companies must no longer mislead smokers with claims that their products are ' light ' or less dangerous for them .
new regulations will force the tobacco companies to update their health warnings by adding the gruesomely truthful , although ultimately futile , information that ' smoking kills ' - a fact most smokers are fully aware of . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just say no the european football association and the european union have teamed up to try to get young people to say " no " to tobacco .

the un intervention comes at a time when the european union is set to decide the island 's case for eu membership at a crucial summit in copenhagen in december .
at the summit , the eu is expected to welcome cyprus and nine other candidate countries to discuss the next steps towards membership and will decide whether the island should join the eu as a whole or only the greek cypriot part .
turkey threatens action if cyprus joins eu first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is an island split by bitter feuding .
however , storm clouds are gathering as turkey has threatened to annex the north of the island if a decision to admit cyprus to the eu is made before turkey has been allowed to join .
turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash remains adamantly opposed to the island 's accession unless turkey is a member , saying the greeks would exploit their eu membership to undermine turkey 's claim to the island or any future power sharing compromise .
greece will veto enlargement if cyprus is excluded for its part , greece has said that it will veto the planned eu expansion if cyprus is excluded from the list of candidate states .
the greek cypriots have applied for eu membership on behalf of the entire island , a move that has only added further fuel to the already blazing row .
" there are going to be some very difficult negotiations ahead , " greece 's eu affairs minister , tassos giannitsis , told the british daily the guardian .
" the question of sovereignty , and how to create a functional working state that can deal with the eu , is ultimately the most important thing we are going to have to deal with . "
there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash have big decisions ahead .
costas simits , the greek premier , called the initiative a ' ' starting point for further negotiations , " stressing that the eu must be satisfied with any final solution .
simitis is expected to meet with the cypriot president galfcos clerides next saturday to discuss the plan in detail .
tensions across cyprus have been rife ever since turkey invaded the north of the island in response to an athens-inspired coup in 1974 .
there are still 35,000 turkish troops stationed on the northern half of the island , and more than 1,000 united nations soldiers manning the green line , which separates the two halves of the island and splits the capital of nicosia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talking peace on cyprus leaders of both sides of the divided island pledge to meet three times a week in the coming weeks to resolve a host of disputes as eu membership looms .

there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash have big decisions ahead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.11.2002 eu anti-smoking campaign from the stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young smokers are about to hear the ' anti ' message from their heroes the eu has enlisted the help of celebrities from entertainment and sport in its initiative that seeks to educate young people on the dangers of smoking . the european commission 's " feel free to say no " anti-smoking initiative received a boost this week when stars from music and sport joined the campaign in a bid to help young people resist the temptations and pressures surrounding the habit .
television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telling smokers their habit kills is like preaching to the converted as the eu continues to spread its anti-smoking message across the continent , the german government recently insisted that tobacco companies must no longer mislead smokers with claims that their products are ' light ' or less dangerous for them .
new regulations will force the tobacco companies to update their health warnings by adding the gruesomely truthful , although ultimately futile , information that ' smoking kills ' - a fact most smokers are fully aware of . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just say no the european football association and the european union have teamed up to try to get young people to say " no " to tobacco .

putin struck a deal with the european union on kaliningrad , due to be surrounded by eu countries after the accession of the ten candidate states , removing a serious obstacle to the biggest ever enlargement of the european union in 2004 .
the russian president gave the green light to the hard- fought agreement which will see the issue of a multiple-entry transit document for travel to all kaliningrad residents from next july .
another seperate document will allow for trips by train .
the agreement was reached despite extensive last-minute haggling by the russians .
the danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen currently in charge of the rotating eu presidency , told the british daily the guardian that the " strategic partnership " between russia and the eu had " found the right balance between all the interests involved " .
the agreement provides access for the enclave 's 1.5m-strong russian population to the russian mainland once the eu is enlarged to the east .
russians wanted unhindered access to enclave president putin had previously insisted that residents of kaliningrad should be able to travel freely to and from the russian mainland through the prospective eu countries of poland and lithuania , should eu enlargement go ahead without any further problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenin overlooks the reconstruction of kaliningrad .
the eu had rejected russian proposals earlier in the year fearing that the crime-riddled enclave might export its notorious drug trafficking and smuggling to the prospective member states .
the russians responded angrily , claiming the eu rules requiring the enclave 's one million citizens to have visas to travel to the rest of russia would be ' humiliating ' .
eu compromise satisfactory for russia now , russia has accepted the eu 's compromise of the " kaliningrad pass " , which will allow frequent travelers to reach mainland russia without a conventional visa .
eu - russian relations have warmed considerably over the past two years . only last week president putin was granted one of his main wishes with the eu formally recognizing russia as a market economy , thus easing the way for it to export more to western europe and join the world trade organization .
official sources hinted that the announcement was deliberately timed to improve the atmosphere of the brussels summit .
the atmosphere at the summit , however , became strained once the subject of chechnya came up .
eu says talks not tanks will solve chechen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechen fighters prepare for moscow 's crackdown president putin sent soldiers back into the breakaway rebel republic in the aftermath of the moscow theatre siege and while the kremlin believes that conducting a new military crackdown in the rebel republic is the way to break the deadlock , the eu insists that political dialogue is the only way ahead .
at the end of the summit , the combined statement put out on the subject was described as ' tepid ' .
the eu and russia both condemned terrorism without commenting specifically on chechnya .
within the four walls of the summit meeting room , things were a little hotter , according to chris patten , the eu external relations commissioner who described the exchanges on the chechen issue as " lively " .
" i could not say that we had a meeting of minds , " he said .
afterwards , president putin was visibly annoyed by journalists ' questions about his decision to commit more troops to the rebel republic and described the chechen seperatists as " religious extremists and international terrorists " .
the war in chechnya had cast a shadow over the summit even before it began .
just two weeks ago , denmark , holder of the eu presidency , had to change the venue from copenhagen to brussels , after president putin threatened to boycott monday 's summit if the chechen world congress was held in the danish capital .
the russians then issued a request for the extradition of chechen rebel envoy , akhmed zakayev from denmark to face charges of terrorist activities in russia and chechnya .

putin struck a deal with the european union on kaliningrad , due to be surrounded by eu countries after the accession of the ten candidate states , removing a serious obstacle to the biggest ever enlargement of the european union in 2004 .
the russian president gave the green light to the hard- fought agreement which will see the issue of a multiple-entry transit document for travel to all kaliningrad residents from next july .
another seperate document will allow for trips by train .
the agreement was reached despite extensive last-minute haggling by the russians .
the danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen currently in charge of the rotating eu presidency , told the british daily the guardian that the " strategic partnership " between russia and the eu had " found the right balance between all the interests involved " .
the agreement provides access for the enclave 's 1.5m-strong russian population to the russian mainland once the eu is enlarged to the east .
russians wanted unhindered access to enclave president putin had previously insisted that residents of kaliningrad should be able to travel freely to and from the russian mainland through the prospective eu countries of poland and lithuania , should eu enlargement go ahead without any further problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenin overlooks the reconstruction of kaliningrad .
the eu had rejected russian proposals earlier in the year fearing that the crime-riddled enclave might export its notorious drug trafficking and smuggling to the prospective member states .
the russians responded angrily , claiming the eu rules requiring the enclave 's one million citizens to have visas to travel to the rest of russia would be ' humiliating ' .
eu compromise satisfactory for russia now , russia has accepted the eu 's compromise of the " kaliningrad pass " , which will allow frequent travelers to reach mainland russia without a conventional visa .
eu - russian relations have warmed considerably over the past two years . only last week president putin was granted one of his main wishes with the eu formally recognizing russia as a market economy , thus easing the way for it to export more to western europe and join the world trade organization .
official sources hinted that the announcement was deliberately timed to improve the atmosphere of the brussels summit .
the atmosphere at the summit , however , became strained once the subject of chechnya came up .
eu says talks not tanks will solve chechen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechen fighters prepare for moscow 's crackdown president putin sent soldiers back into the breakaway rebel republic in the aftermath of the moscow theatre siege and while the kremlin believes that conducting a new military crackdown in the rebel republic is the way to break the deadlock , the eu insists that political dialogue is the only way ahead .
at the end of the summit , the combined statement put out on the subject was described as ' tepid ' .
the eu and russia both condemned terrorism without commenting specifically on chechnya .
within the four walls of the summit meeting room , things were a little hotter , according to chris patten , the eu external relations commissioner who described the exchanges on the chechen issue as " lively " .
" i could not say that we had a meeting of minds , " he said .
afterwards , president putin was visibly annoyed by journalists ' questions about his decision to commit more troops to the rebel republic and described the chechen seperatists as " religious extremists and international terrorists " .
the war in chechnya had cast a shadow over the summit even before it began .
just two weeks ago , denmark , holder of the eu presidency , had to change the venue from copenhagen to brussels , after president putin threatened to boycott monday 's summit if the chechen world congress was held in the danish capital .
the russians then issued a request for the extradition of chechen rebel envoy , akhmed zakayev from denmark to face charges of terrorist activities in russia and chechnya .
the danes are still considering the request . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaliningrad problem inches towards resolution a tricky chapter in eu enlargement negotiations appears on the way to a solution after the eu commission proposed a special transit pass for residents of kalingrad to ease their freedom of movement after enlargement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.11.2002 eu anti-smoking campaign from the stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young smokers are about to hear the ' anti ' message from their heroes the eu has enlisted the help of celebrities from entertainment and sport in its initiative that seeks to educate young people on the dangers of smoking . the european commission 's " feel free to say no " anti-smoking initiative received a boost this week when stars from music and sport joined the campaign in a bid to help young people resist the temptations and pressures surrounding the habit .
television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telling smokers their habit kills is like preaching to the converted as the eu continues to spread its anti-smoking message across the continent , the german government recently insisted that tobacco companies must no longer mislead smokers with claims that their products are ' light ' or less dangerous for them .
new regulations will force the tobacco companies to update their health warnings by adding the gruesomely truthful , although ultimately futile , information that ' smoking kills ' - a fact most smokers are fully aware of . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just say no the european football association and the european union have teamed up to try to get young people to say " no " to tobacco .

how do such attitudes affect dating in germany ? the film is based on personal experience and many experiences of friends , where supposedly everything was fine being with a non-jew .

television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telling smokers their habit kills is like preaching to the converted as the eu continues to spread its anti-smoking message across the continent , the german government recently insisted that tobacco companies must no longer mislead smokers with claims that their products are ' light ' or less dangerous for them .

putin struck a deal with the european union on kaliningrad , due to be surrounded by eu countries after the accession of the ten candidate states , removing a serious obstacle to the biggest ever enlargement of the european union in 2004 .
the russian president gave the green light to the hard- fought agreement which will see the issue of a multiple-entry transit document for travel to all kaliningrad residents from next july .
another seperate document will allow for trips by train .
the agreement was reached despite extensive last-minute haggling by the russians .
the danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen currently in charge of the rotating eu presidency , told the british daily the guardian that the " strategic partnership " between russia and the eu had " found the right balance between all the interests involved " .
the agreement provides access for the enclave 's 1.5m-strong russian population to the russian mainland once the eu is enlarged to the east .
russians wanted unhindered access to enclave president putin had previously insisted that residents of kaliningrad should be able to travel freely to and from the russian mainland through the prospective eu countries of poland and lithuania , should eu enlargement go ahead without any further problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenin overlooks the reconstruction of kaliningrad .
the eu had rejected russian proposals earlier in the year fearing that the crime-riddled enclave might export its notorious drug trafficking and smuggling to the prospective member states .
the russians responded angrily , claiming the eu rules requiring the enclave 's one million citizens to have visas to travel to the rest of russia would be ' humiliating ' .
eu compromise satisfactory for russia now , russia has accepted the eu 's compromise of the " kaliningrad pass " , which will allow frequent travelers to reach mainland russia without a conventional visa .
eu - russian relations have warmed considerably over the past two years . only last week president putin was granted one of his main wishes with the eu formally recognizing russia as a market economy , thus easing the way for it to export more to western europe and join the world trade organization .
official sources hinted that the announcement was deliberately timed to improve the atmosphere of the brussels summit .
the atmosphere at the summit , however , became strained once the subject of chechnya came up .
eu says talks not tanks will solve chechen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechen fighters prepare for moscow 's crackdown president putin sent soldiers back into the breakaway rebel republic in the aftermath of the moscow theatre siege and while the kremlin believes that conducting a new military crackdown in the rebel republic is the way to break the deadlock , the eu insists that political dialogue is the only way ahead .
at the end of the summit , the combined statement put out on the subject was described as ' tepid ' .
the eu and russia both condemned terrorism without commenting specifically on chechnya .
within the four walls of the summit meeting room , things were a little hotter , according to chris patten , the eu external relations commissioner who described the exchanges on the chechen issue as " lively " .
" i could not say that we had a meeting of minds , " he said .
afterwards , president putin was visibly annoyed by journalists ' questions about his decision to commit more troops to the rebel republic and described the chechen seperatists as " religious extremists and international terrorists " .
the war in chechnya had cast a shadow over the summit even before it began .
just two weeks ago , denmark , holder of the eu presidency , had to change the venue from copenhagen to brussels , after president putin threatened to boycott monday 's summit if the chechen world congress was held in the danish capital .
the russians then issued a request for the extradition of chechen rebel envoy , akhmed zakayev from denmark to face charges of terrorist activities in russia and chechnya .
the danes are still considering the request . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaliningrad problem inches towards resolution a tricky chapter in eu enlargement negotiations appears on the way to a solution after the eu commission proposed a special transit pass for residents of kalingrad to ease their freedom of movement after enlargement .

in her first short feature film , " berlin beshert , " she follows the dating experiences of two jewish sisters in berlin .
the film premieres on tuesday at berlin 's kino arsenal as part of a cultural festival sponsored by the jewish community of berlin . dahlia is straight and culturally jewish .
leah is lesbian and religious .
both are searching for a soulmate -lrb- " beshert " in yiddish -rrb- in order to avoid their mother 's threat of taking them to a matchmaker for arranged marriages . dw-world caught up with the filmmaker in berlin . your film is about jewish singles in berlin .
what are the main issues you address ? it 's a satire .
that 's important .
i 'm trying to address clichés about jewish life in germany and trying to show what modern life is like here in berlin .
often it is only seen as something religious or something related to synagogues or klezmer music .
i tried to break down these clichés . the film follows the dating adventures of dahila and leah .
on their first blind date , both end up at a klezmer concert with two very different dates .
on the one hand , there 's a visiting american jewish journalist who 's trying to find out about jewish life in germany .
he takes dahlia there .
he thinks , ' wow , what a thriving jewish community . '
even though none of the musicians are jewish and nobody in the audience is jewish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : november wanderin berlin beshert the other date is barbara .
she says she 's jewish , but she 's jewish because something like her grandmother 's father 's ex-husband was jewish .
she think all jews listen to klezmer music . how did the film come about ? the jüdische kulturtage -lrb- jewish cultural days festival -rrb- invited six jewish filmmakers from berlin to make a short piece about jewish life in berlin today .
that was the only requirement , we could choose which genre we wanted my first impulse was to make something very modern .
i was tired of only seeing jewish topics presented in a historical context .
i wanted something in color , not in black-and-white .
something about our lives here and now , not a story that 's only centered on the holocaust .
i wanted to attempt to reflect something of my generation .
to take a universal theme – love - and show what different realities we have . a recent study found that 22 percent of germans believe that jews have too much influence in germany , and 17 percent believe that jews are responsible for their own persecution .
how do such attitudes affect dating in germany ? the film is based on personal experience and many experiences of friends , where supposedly everything was fine being with a non-jew .
but then at some point some really harsh things came out that were maybe not anti-semitic , but were about not being able to relate or feeling alienated on some level . are the concerns the same for homosexuals and heterosexuals ? it 's the same .
that 's the point .
they both experience these kinds of impossible people . … but there 's a happy ending . berlin beschert is the precursor of a longer film you have in the works .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.11.2002 eu anti-smoking campaign from the stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young smokers are about to hear the ' anti ' message from their heroes the eu has enlisted the help of celebrities from entertainment and sport in its initiative that seeks to educate young people on the dangers of smoking . the european commission 's " feel free to say no " anti-smoking initiative received a boost this week when stars from music and sport joined the campaign in a bid to help young people resist the temptations and pressures surrounding the habit .
television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telling smokers their habit kills is like preaching to the converted as the eu continues to spread its anti-smoking message across the continent , the german government recently insisted that tobacco companies must no longer mislead smokers with claims that their products are ' light ' or less dangerous for them .
new regulations will force the tobacco companies to update their health warnings by adding the gruesomely truthful , although ultimately futile , information that ' smoking kills ' - a fact most smokers are fully aware of . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just say no the european football association and the european union have teamed up to try to get young people to say " no " to tobacco .

the un intervention comes at a time when the european union is set to decide the island 's case for eu membership at a crucial summit in copenhagen in december .
at the summit , the eu is expected to welcome cyprus and nine other candidate countries to discuss the next steps towards membership and will decide whether the island should join the eu as a whole or only the greek cypriot part .
turkey threatens action if cyprus joins eu first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is an island split by bitter feuding .
however , storm clouds are gathering as turkey has threatened to annex the north of the island if a decision to admit cyprus to the eu is made before turkey has been allowed to join .
turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash remains adamantly opposed to the island 's accession unless turkey is a member , saying the greeks would exploit their eu membership to undermine turkey 's claim to the island or any future power sharing compromise .
greece will veto enlargement if cyprus is excluded for its part , greece has said that it will veto the planned eu expansion if cyprus is excluded from the list of candidate states .
the greek cypriots have applied for eu membership on behalf of the entire island , a move that has only added further fuel to the already blazing row .
" there are going to be some very difficult negotiations ahead , " greece 's eu affairs minister , tassos giannitsis , told the british daily the guardian .
" the question of sovereignty , and how to create a functional working state that can deal with the eu , is ultimately the most important thing we are going to have to deal with . "
there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash have big decisions ahead .
costas simits , the greek premier , called the initiative a ' ' starting point for further negotiations , " stressing that the eu must be satisfied with any final solution .
simitis is expected to meet with the cypriot president galfcos clerides next saturday to discuss the plan in detail .
tensions across cyprus have been rife ever since turkey invaded the north of the island in response to an athens-inspired coup in 1974 .
there are still 35,000 turkish troops stationed on the northern half of the island , and more than 1,000 united nations soldiers manning the green line , which separates the two halves of the island and splits the capital of nicosia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talking peace on cyprus leaders of both sides of the divided island pledge to meet three times a week in the coming weeks to resolve a host of disputes as eu membership looms .

putin struck a deal with the european union on kaliningrad , due to be surrounded by eu countries after the accession of the ten candidate states , removing a serious obstacle to the biggest ever enlargement of the european union in 2004 .
the russian president gave the green light to the hard- fought agreement which will see the issue of a multiple-entry transit document for travel to all kaliningrad residents from next july .
another seperate document will allow for trips by train .
the agreement was reached despite extensive last-minute haggling by the russians .
the danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen currently in charge of the rotating eu presidency , told the british daily the guardian that the " strategic partnership " between russia and the eu had " found the right balance between all the interests involved " .
the agreement provides access for the enclave 's 1.5m-strong russian population to the russian mainland once the eu is enlarged to the east .

the eu had rejected russian proposals earlier in the year fearing that the crime-riddled enclave might export its notorious drug trafficking and smuggling to the prospective member states .
the russians responded angrily , claiming the eu rules requiring the enclave 's one million citizens to have visas to travel to the rest of russia would be ' humiliating ' .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.11.2002 un cyprus deadline sets eu on tenterhooks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan hopes to reunite the two sides of cyprus permanently the un has given the warring factions on the island of cyprus one month to come to a peaceful solution to the island 's sovereignty or risk a permanent divide that could have serious repercussions for the eu . un secretary general kofi annan has given cyprus one month to achieve peace and consolidate the two divided sides of the island that has been a scene of unrest and violence for the past 28 years .
the un intervention comes at a time when the european union is set to decide the island 's case for eu membership at a crucial summit in copenhagen in december .
at the summit , the eu is expected to welcome cyprus and nine other candidate countries to discuss the next steps towards membership and will decide whether the island should join the eu as a whole or only the greek cypriot part .
turkey threatens action if cyprus joins eu first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is an island split by bitter feuding .
however , storm clouds are gathering as turkey has threatened to annex the north of the island if a decision to admit cyprus to the eu is made before turkey has been allowed to join .
turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash remains adamantly opposed to the island 's accession unless turkey is a member , saying the greeks would exploit their eu membership to undermine turkey 's claim to the island or any future power sharing compromise .
greece will veto enlargement if cyprus is excluded for its part , greece has said that it will veto the planned eu expansion if cyprus is excluded from the list of candidate states .
the greek cypriots have applied for eu membership on behalf of the entire island , a move that has only added further fuel to the already blazing row .
" there are going to be some very difficult negotiations ahead , " greece 's eu affairs minister , tassos giannitsis , told the british daily the guardian .
" the question of sovereignty , and how to create a functional working state that can deal with the eu , is ultimately the most important thing we are going to have to deal with . "
there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash have big decisions ahead .
costas simits , the greek premier , called the initiative a ' ' starting point for further negotiations , " stressing that the eu must be satisfied with any final solution .

putin struck a deal with the european union on kaliningrad , due to be surrounded by eu countries after the accession of the ten candidate states , removing a serious obstacle to the biggest ever enlargement of the european union in 2004 .
the russian president gave the green light to the hard- fought agreement which will see the issue of a multiple-entry transit document for travel to all kaliningrad residents from next july .
another seperate document will allow for trips by train .
the agreement was reached despite extensive last-minute haggling by the russians .
the danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen currently in charge of the rotating eu presidency , told the british daily the guardian that the " strategic partnership " between russia and the eu had " found the right balance between all the interests involved " .
the agreement provides access for the enclave 's 1.5m-strong russian population to the russian mainland once the eu is enlarged to the east .
russians wanted unhindered access to enclave president putin had previously insisted that residents of kaliningrad should be able to travel freely to and from the russian mainland through the prospective eu countries of poland and lithuania , should eu enlargement go ahead without any further problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenin overlooks the reconstruction of kaliningrad .
the eu had rejected russian proposals earlier in the year fearing that the crime-riddled enclave might export its notorious drug trafficking and smuggling to the prospective member states .
the russians responded angrily , claiming the eu rules requiring the enclave 's one million citizens to have visas to travel to the rest of russia would be ' humiliating ' .
eu compromise satisfactory for russia now , russia has accepted the eu 's compromise of the " kaliningrad pass " , which will allow frequent travelers to reach mainland russia without a conventional visa .
eu - russian relations have warmed considerably over the past two years . only last week president putin was granted one of his main wishes with the eu formally recognizing russia as a market economy , thus easing the way for it to export more to western europe and join the world trade organization .
official sources hinted that the announcement was deliberately timed to improve the atmosphere of the brussels summit .
the atmosphere at the summit , however , became strained once the subject of chechnya came up .
eu says talks not tanks will solve chechen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechen fighters prepare for moscow 's crackdown president putin sent soldiers back into the breakaway rebel republic in the aftermath of the moscow theatre siege and while the kremlin believes that conducting a new military crackdown in the rebel republic is the way to break the deadlock , the eu insists that political dialogue is the only way ahead .
at the end of the summit , the combined statement put out on the subject was described as ' tepid ' .
the eu and russia both condemned terrorism without commenting specifically on chechnya .
within the four walls of the summit meeting room , things were a little hotter , according to chris patten , the eu external relations commissioner who described the exchanges on the chechen issue as " lively " .
" i could not say that we had a meeting of minds , " he said .
afterwards , president putin was visibly annoyed by journalists ' questions about his decision to commit more troops to the rebel republic and described the chechen seperatists as " religious extremists and international terrorists " .
the war in chechnya had cast a shadow over the summit even before it began .

the un intervention comes at a time when the european union is set to decide the island 's case for eu membership at a crucial summit in copenhagen in december .
at the summit , the eu is expected to welcome cyprus and nine other candidate countries to discuss the next steps towards membership and will decide whether the island should join the eu as a whole or only the greek cypriot part .
turkey threatens action if cyprus joins eu first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is an island split by bitter feuding .
however , storm clouds are gathering as turkey has threatened to annex the north of the island if a decision to admit cyprus to the eu is made before turkey has been allowed to join .
turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash remains adamantly opposed to the island 's accession unless turkey is a member , saying the greeks would exploit their eu membership to undermine turkey 's claim to the island or any future power sharing compromise .
greece will veto enlargement if cyprus is excluded for its part , greece has said that it will veto the planned eu expansion if cyprus is excluded from the list of candidate states .
the greek cypriots have applied for eu membership on behalf of the entire island , a move that has only added further fuel to the already blazing row .
" there are going to be some very difficult negotiations ahead , " greece 's eu affairs minister , tassos giannitsis , told the british daily the guardian .
" the question of sovereignty , and how to create a functional working state that can deal with the eu , is ultimately the most important thing we are going to have to deal with . "
there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash have big decisions ahead .
costas simits , the greek premier , called the initiative a ' ' starting point for further negotiations , " stressing that the eu must be satisfied with any final solution .
simitis is expected to meet with the cypriot president galfcos clerides next saturday to discuss the plan in detail .
tensions across cyprus have been rife ever since turkey invaded the north of the island in response to an athens-inspired coup in 1974 .
there are still 35,000 turkish troops stationed on the northern half of the island , and more than 1,000 united nations soldiers manning the green line , which separates the two halves of the island and splits the capital of nicosia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talking peace on cyprus leaders of both sides of the divided island pledge to meet three times a week in the coming weeks to resolve a host of disputes as eu membership looms .

television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telling smokers their habit kills is like preaching to the converted as the eu continues to spread its anti-smoking message across the continent , the german government recently insisted that tobacco companies must no longer mislead smokers with claims that their products are ' light ' or less dangerous for them .

television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .

a rise in bad loans and a writedown in the value of its equity investments mean that 300 jobs in the investment banking sector alone will be cut , bank chairman klaus-peter müller confirmed at a frankfurt press conference .
there 's even talk of closing down entire offices in new york , singapore and tokyo .
looking ahead , müller said prospects for next year were not entirely rosy : " we would be well-advised to formulate modest expectations for 2003 as well . "
reporting a pre-tax third-quarter loss of 133 million euros , commerzbank joined two other major german players , deutsche bank and hypovereinsbank , who both posted substantial losses in the third quarter .
worst crisis in 50 years in an interview with dw-world , commerzbank chief economist peter pietsch painted a bleak short and mid-term picture : " the situation is the worst the banking sector 's been in in the last 50 years , and there 's nothing on the horizon to make me confident of a recovery anytime soon , " he said .
although he dismissed recent rumors that commerzbank was facing a liquidity crisis making it a potential takeover target , he acknowledged that the bank needed a fundamental restructuring : " the objective has to be to save , save and save again and as painful as it may be , that means cutting personnel costs too . "
pietsch added that there was little chance of the overall economic climate improving over the next year .

putin struck a deal with the european union on kaliningrad , due to be surrounded by eu countries after the accession of the ten candidate states , removing a serious obstacle to the biggest ever enlargement of the european union in 2004 .
the russian president gave the green light to the hard- fought agreement which will see the issue of a multiple-entry transit document for travel to all kaliningrad residents from next july .
another seperate document will allow for trips by train .
the agreement was reached despite extensive last-minute haggling by the russians .
the danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen currently in charge of the rotating eu presidency , told the british daily the guardian that the " strategic partnership " between russia and the eu had " found the right balance between all the interests involved " .
the agreement provides access for the enclave 's 1.5m-strong russian population to the russian mainland once the eu is enlarged to the east .
russians wanted unhindered access to enclave president putin had previously insisted that residents of kaliningrad should be able to travel freely to and from the russian mainland through the prospective eu countries of poland and lithuania , should eu enlargement go ahead without any further problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lenin overlooks the reconstruction of kaliningrad .
the eu had rejected russian proposals earlier in the year fearing that the crime-riddled enclave might export its notorious drug trafficking and smuggling to the prospective member states .
the russians responded angrily , claiming the eu rules requiring the enclave 's one million citizens to have visas to travel to the rest of russia would be ' humiliating ' .
eu compromise satisfactory for russia now , russia has accepted the eu 's compromise of the " kaliningrad pass " , which will allow frequent travelers to reach mainland russia without a conventional visa .
eu - russian relations have warmed considerably over the past two years . only last week president putin was granted one of his main wishes with the eu formally recognizing russia as a market economy , thus easing the way for it to export more to western europe and join the world trade organization .
official sources hinted that the announcement was deliberately timed to improve the atmosphere of the brussels summit .
the atmosphere at the summit , however , became strained once the subject of chechnya came up .
eu says talks not tanks will solve chechen problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechen fighters prepare for moscow 's crackdown president putin sent soldiers back into the breakaway rebel republic in the aftermath of the moscow theatre siege and while the kremlin believes that conducting a new military crackdown in the rebel republic is the way to break the deadlock , the eu insists that political dialogue is the only way ahead .
at the end of the summit , the combined statement put out on the subject was described as ' tepid ' .
the eu and russia both condemned terrorism without commenting specifically on chechnya .
within the four walls of the summit meeting room , things were a little hotter , according to chris patten , the eu external relations commissioner who described the exchanges on the chechen issue as " lively " .
" i could not say that we had a meeting of minds , " he said .
afterwards , president putin was visibly annoyed by journalists ' questions about his decision to commit more troops to the rebel republic and described the chechen seperatists as " religious extremists and international terrorists " .
the war in chechnya had cast a shadow over the summit even before it began .
just two weeks ago , denmark , holder of the eu presidency , had to change the venue from copenhagen to brussels , after president putin threatened to boycott monday 's summit if the chechen world congress was held in the danish capital .
the russians then issued a request for the extradition of chechen rebel envoy , akhmed zakayev from denmark to face charges of terrorist activities in russia and chechnya .

i 'm trying to address clichés about jewish life in germany and trying to show what modern life is like here in berlin .
often it is only seen as something religious or something related to synagogues or klezmer music .
i tried to break down these clichés . the film follows the dating adventures of dahila and leah .
on their first blind date , both end up at a klezmer concert with two very different dates .
on the one hand , there 's a visiting american jewish journalist who 's trying to find out about jewish life in germany .
he takes dahlia there .
he thinks , ' wow , what a thriving jewish community . '
even though none of the musicians are jewish and nobody in the audience is jewish .

to take a universal theme – love - and show what different realities we have . a recent study found that 22 percent of germans believe that jews have too much influence in germany , and 17 percent believe that jews are responsible for their own persecution .
how do such attitudes affect dating in germany ? the film is based on personal experience and many experiences of friends , where supposedly everything was fine being with a non-jew .
but then at some point some really harsh things came out that were maybe not anti-semitic , but were about not being able to relate or feeling alienated on some level . are the concerns the same for homosexuals and heterosexuals ? it 's the same .

they both experience these kinds of impossible people . … but there 's a happy ending . berlin beschert is the precursor of a longer film you have in the works .

the un intervention comes at a time when the european union is set to decide the island 's case for eu membership at a crucial summit in copenhagen in december .
at the summit , the eu is expected to welcome cyprus and nine other candidate countries to discuss the next steps towards membership and will decide whether the island should join the eu as a whole or only the greek cypriot part .
turkey threatens action if cyprus joins eu first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is an island split by bitter feuding .
however , storm clouds are gathering as turkey has threatened to annex the north of the island if a decision to admit cyprus to the eu is made before turkey has been allowed to join .
turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash remains adamantly opposed to the island 's accession unless turkey is a member , saying the greeks would exploit their eu membership to undermine turkey 's claim to the island or any future power sharing compromise .
greece will veto enlargement if cyprus is excluded for its part , greece has said that it will veto the planned eu expansion if cyprus is excluded from the list of candidate states .
the greek cypriots have applied for eu membership on behalf of the entire island , a move that has only added further fuel to the already blazing row .
" there are going to be some very difficult negotiations ahead , " greece 's eu affairs minister , tassos giannitsis , told the british daily the guardian .
" the question of sovereignty , and how to create a functional working state that can deal with the eu , is ultimately the most important thing we are going to have to deal with . "
there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash have big decisions ahead .
costas simits , the greek premier , called the initiative a ' ' starting point for further negotiations , " stressing that the eu must be satisfied with any final solution .
simitis is expected to meet with the cypriot president galfcos clerides next saturday to discuss the plan in detail .
tensions across cyprus have been rife ever since turkey invaded the north of the island in response to an athens-inspired coup in 1974 .
there are still 35,000 turkish troops stationed on the northern half of the island , and more than 1,000 united nations soldiers manning the green line , which separates the two halves of the island and splits the capital of nicosia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talking peace on cyprus leaders of both sides of the divided island pledge to meet three times a week in the coming weeks to resolve a host of disputes as eu membership looms .

the un intervention comes at a time when the european union is set to decide the island 's case for eu membership at a crucial summit in copenhagen in december .
at the summit , the eu is expected to welcome cyprus and nine other candidate countries to discuss the next steps towards membership and will decide whether the island should join the eu as a whole or only the greek cypriot part .
turkey threatens action if cyprus joins eu first bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus is an island split by bitter feuding .
however , storm clouds are gathering as turkey has threatened to annex the north of the island if a decision to admit cyprus to the eu is made before turkey has been allowed to join .
turkish cypriot leader , rauf denktash remains adamantly opposed to the island 's accession unless turkey is a member , saying the greeks would exploit their eu membership to undermine turkey 's claim to the island or any future power sharing compromise .
greece will veto enlargement if cyprus is excluded for its part , greece has said that it will veto the planned eu expansion if cyprus is excluded from the list of candidate states .
the greek cypriots have applied for eu membership on behalf of the entire island , a move that has only added further fuel to the already blazing row .
" there are going to be some very difficult negotiations ahead , " greece 's eu affairs minister , tassos giannitsis , told the british daily the guardian .
" the question of sovereignty , and how to create a functional working state that can deal with the eu , is ultimately the most important thing we are going to have to deal with . "
there has been no deadline set for the leaders to respond - only the timetable of one month to reach agreement on the reunification strategy .
the united nations delivered details of its peace initiative to the greek cypriot and turkish cypriot leaders as well as those of greece , turkey and britain .
it is believed to include the choice of three models that would hopefully avert any damaging decision by either side regarding the future governing of cyprus within an eu context .
annan offers three models of reunification * the greek and turkish factions can accept a sovereign state based on the model of belgium in which the posts of president and prime minister revolve ; * the two sides can form one state based on the swiss model , with six greek cypriot and three turkish cypriot ministers ; * cyprus becomes a state in which an executive president and a vice-president share the power with each having a right of veto .
kofi annan 's proposal is also thought to include plans for the gradual withdrawal of turkish troops from the occupied north and a staggered return , over the next 20 years , of an estimated 200,000 refugees forcibly displaced in 1974 .
the secretary general said , " i think the parties know what i have put before them and they are going to study it .
i think they realize we have a limited opportunity as we move forward , that there is a unique time in the possibility of getting a united cyprus into the european union . "
both sides cautious while asking for time to decide in a statement issued in new york , rauf denktash said that he would evaluate the proposals in a constructive manner .
but he warned any ' third parties ' that they should allow him time to examine the proposals by saying : ' ' the two leaders should have the opportunity and the time for free deliberations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek cypriot leader glafcos clerides and turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash have big decisions ahead .
costas simits , the greek premier , called the initiative a ' ' starting point for further negotiations , " stressing that the eu must be satisfied with any final solution .
simitis is expected to meet with the cypriot president galfcos clerides next saturday to discuss the plan in detail .
tensions across cyprus have been rife ever since turkey invaded the north of the island in response to an athens-inspired coup in 1974 .
there are still 35,000 turkish troops stationed on the northern half of the island , and more than 1,000 united nations soldiers manning the green line , which separates the two halves of the island and splits the capital of nicosia . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de talking peace on cyprus leaders of both sides of the divided island pledge to meet three times a week in the coming weeks to resolve a host of disputes as eu membership looms .

television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telling smokers their habit kills is like preaching to the converted as the eu continues to spread its anti-smoking message across the continent , the german government recently insisted that tobacco companies must no longer mislead smokers with claims that their products are ' light ' or less dangerous for them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.11.2002 eu anti-smoking campaign from the stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young smokers are about to hear the ' anti ' message from their heroes the eu has enlisted the help of celebrities from entertainment and sport in its initiative that seeks to educate young people on the dangers of smoking . the european commission 's " feel free to say no " anti-smoking initiative received a boost this week when stars from music and sport joined the campaign in a bid to help young people resist the temptations and pressures surrounding the habit .
television and cinema advertisements for the campaign featuring the eu commissioner david byrne with lou pearlman , the man behind the backstreet boys and n 'sync , together with canadian band b4-4 started on november 10th .
the ads will be seen on 30 national tv channels across the continent , on mtv europe and in over 5000 cinemas .
b4-4 has also released a new single under the title of the campaign .
stars from music and soccer help spread the message bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moby just says ' no ' .
the eu 's message is simple .
young people across europe should be persuaded not to smoke or should be supported in their efforts to stop .
pop stars such as the american techno icon moby , boy band natural and british singer sophie ellis bextor have lent their support while a host of world cup soccer stars , including germany 's michael ballack , gerald asamoah and french star zinedine zidane , have also signed up for the campaign .
thorsten muench , assistant to the eu commissioner in brussels , told dw-world : " young people look up to these people , as heroes in some cases .
we think it is more appropriate if a pop star or sports personality tells them ' smoking is not good , do n't be fooled , make your own decisons but make them based on facts . '
" muench added that the pop star involvement would become more high-profile next year when a campaign bus , complete with stage , will tour the eu member states .
bands and artists associated with the initiative will perform while educational and promotional material will also be available .
the campaign officially kicked off on may 31st , international world no tobacco day and the opening game of the 2002 world cup in korean and japan .
throughout the year , national opening events and press conferences have taken place simultaneously across a number of eu member states .
campaign targets the age group most likely to smoke the " feel free to say no " initiative is mainly aimed at people between the ages of 12 and 18 .
this is the age group that produces 80 percent of all smokers who go on to be regular inhalers of the dangerous weed .
health experts at the eu estimate that half of all smokers who started during this time will later fall victim to the long-term effects of the habit .
the major health risks caused by smoking are well known and proven by medical evidence , so the dangers are clear .
but with this new initiative , the eu commission plans to become actively involved in promoting the image of non-smoking as well as helping those who already smoke , to bring about a change in the social attitudes towards tobacco consumption that make hard decisions for young people even harder .
combating the problems by changing attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : james dean regularly said ' yes , please ! '
despite the widespread knowledge that smoking causes such fatal diseases as cancer and emphysema , the continued portrayal of smoking as a cool pastime and image enhancing accessory in popular culture still draws in numbers of impressionable people .
the new eu campaign focuses on building the self-esteem and confidence of the would-be smoker by promoting free will not to smoke as an even cooler lifestyle choice .
steering clear of the usual lecturing and patronizing , the " feel free to say no " initiative is designed to appeal much more to the lifestyle and emotions of the young .
by offering an escape from the pressures of smoking peers and the advertising campaigns of the tobacco companies , the initiative hopes to promote the non-smoker as a person who consciously ignores the pressures and ultimately lives free .
education in health dangers and pitfalls of advertising as well as aiming the slogans and events at the consumers of cigarettes , the eu has also targeted the producers .
the campaign 's communication division aims to expose what they see as the manipulative pr and advertising strategies of the tobacco industry while providing educational material on health issues and enormous addictive potential of the nicotine drug .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telling smokers their habit kills is like preaching to the converted as the eu continues to spread its anti-smoking message across the continent , the german government recently insisted that tobacco companies must no longer mislead smokers with claims that their products are ' light ' or less dangerous for them .
new regulations will force the tobacco companies to update their health warnings by adding the gruesomely truthful , although ultimately futile , information that ' smoking kills ' - a fact most smokers are fully aware of . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de just say no the european football association and the european union have teamed up to try to get young people to say " no " to tobacco .

the attack killed five israelis , including a mother and her two young sons .
palestinian sources and eyewitnesses say that about 30 tanks , armoured troop carriers and jeeps entered the camp at about 0300 local time -lrb- 0100 gmt -rrb- .
the israeli army told the associated press news agency that the troops arrested three men before withdrawing several hours later .
earlier , israeli security sources said the army would strike at the tulkarm and nablus areas of the west bank because of suspected links with the kibbutz gun attack .
israeli prime minister ariel sharon and defence minister shaul mofaz visited the kibbutz on monday .
palestinian leader yasser arafat has said he will appoint a committee to investigate the attack .
pressure on sharon the attack also happened at the start of an election campaign , as israeli politicians vie to appear patriotic and tough on terrorism .
mr sharon is under pressure to take strong action after the new foreign minister , binyamin netanyahu - who is challenging him for leadership of the right-wing likud party - repeated his call for mr arafat to be exiled .
the attack coincided with a visit by an american envoy , david satterfield , who is seeking to revive the stalled peace process .
the killings took place inside israel itself , not in one of the controversial settlements in the west bank , and targeted a kibbutz which had a history of left-wing politics and co-operation with its arab neighbours . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's elizabeth blunt reports from jerusalem " tulkarm is one of the refugee camps in the area where a kibbutz was attacked on sunday night " key stories israel 's early elections bombs and labour israel seeks us cash hamas resurgent profiles ariel sharon binyamin netanyahu amram mitzna yasser arafat factfile voices from the conflict talking point what will stop the suicide bombings ?

alderman gavyn arthur said the " dire " state of the capital 's transport system was threatening london 's status as an international financial centre .
public transport delays and traffic congestion were putting off international businesses and inconveniencing millions of workers , he said .
mr arthur was speaking at the annual lord mayor 's banquet with the capital 's elected mayor , ken livingstone , sitting just yards away . "
we are fast approaching the time when the financial pre-eminence of the city may become seriously imperilled " alderman gavyn arthur mr arthur said there was a widespread view that traffic lights were being deliberately set to red to bring the city to a " virtual gridlock " .
some have previously complained the lights have been re-timed to cause more congestion , and will then be altered again when the congestion charge begins in february , to create the impression of a successful policy .
to loud applause from many of the 750 guests in london 's guildhall , mr arthur said " transport ... is dire , and so bad that we are fast approaching the time when the financial pre-eminence of the city may become seriously imperilled .
" much of the infrastructure of public transport is crumbling .
i take the tube every day of my working life .
virtually every day , i am delayed .
" journey times are up to twice what they were two or three years ago . "
the lord mayor continued : " millions of london 's workers are inconvenienced .
what a waste of time , what a waste of productive time , what a way to treat people .
" over the last year , central london 's traffic has deteriorated to virtual gridlock .
not because of more vehicles , but because of massive road works and the alteration of traffic light frequencies . "
what a waste of time , what a waste of productive time , what a way to treat people " gavyn arthur " the perception is that traffic is being deliberately brought to a halt .
" as i have said , this is now threatening the financial viability of the city of london , " he said .
international tourism leaders ran into travel chaos in london earlier on monday as they struggled to get to docklands for the prestigious world travel market .
with trains on docklands light railway breaking down , some exhibitors took up to two-and-a-half hours to complete what should have been 40-minute trips to docklands from central london .
in the afternoon custom house - the docklands light railway station serving the excel exhibition centre - had to be shut through overcrowding .

he has written a personal account of his expeditions to the different faces of everest .
chris bonington was the first to scale everest ' the hard way ' - by the south west face - in 1975 .
no other mountaineer , writer or photographer has as much experience of everest , having taken part in four expeditions on the mountain itself and 26 other expeditions in the himalayas .
in 1985 chris reached the summit of mount everest as a member of a norwegian expedition led by arne næss .
the expedition was the most successful everest expedition ever before , placing most of the expedition members on the summit .
here are some quotes from sir chris 's book about his attempts on everest : the triumphs , the tragedies and the changes that have come to the mountain area he loves .
one of the joys of mountaineering in this fast-shrinking world is that mountaineers for many generations will still be able to discover untrodden corners of the greater mountain ranges of the earth .
we , however , shall always feel fortunate and privileged to have been able to unravel the complex problems that were presented by the world 's highest and steepest mountain face .
it is n't so much a matter of doing something dangerous as being master of that danger i often feel that the preparations for an expedition are like the description of a first pregnancy - of intense interest and importance to the participants but certainly not unique .
it is the wives of climbers who are the courageous ones , who have to cope with real stress , who have to sit back and wait , and all too often break the news to wives of the ones who do n't come back .

but the principle is a fundamental aspect of the party 's philosophy and it is thought the liberal democrats will press the issue in its negotiations with labour .
the lib dems want a better local voting system yet labour 's rank and file members are set against any such moves .
the liberal democratss are confused by the draft manifesto failing to mention pr , because the existing coalition sets out to promote the recommendations of a commission , which has urged a new proportional voting system in wales .
labour 's coalition partners want concessions on the issue to pave the way for the party 's future support .
but rhodri morgan is set to face calls from traditional party members to stick to the black and white print in the manifesto .
the liberal democrats ' leadership has said it also wants increased investment in public services , and the strengthening of welsh communities to be central to talks over a new coalition administration . watch / listen on this story bbc wales ' simon morris reports " pr is bound to be a key part of talks on a new lib-lab deal next year " see also : 20 oct 02 -pipe- wales lib dems review political ' marriage ' 27 apr 99 -pipe- parties and issues assembly ' must be relevant ' 16 oct 00 -pipe- wales welsh lib-dems join assembly cabinet 06 oct 00 -pipe- wales labour ams angry over deputy post 09 oct 00 -pipe- wales lib dem leader 's coalition tour top wales stories now : boyfriend sought in murder inquiry girl will wait for jailed ' rapist ' lover cash boost for brecon jazz hello !

westminster briefings indicate the government plans to set up local tribunals to consider where hunting is justified - and upland areas like dartmoor and exmoor are the most likely .
about 15 hunts operate on dartmoor and exmoor , but more could be drawn to the area if a deal is agreed .
a bill to ban or partially ban hunting with dogs is almost certain to be announced in the queen 's speech on wednesday . "
hunting is no less cruel on dartmoor or exmoor than anywhere else " league against cruel sports the tribunals would consist of local people , from both sides of the hunting debate , chaired by someone from the legal world and they would decide if pest control was needed in a certain area and from there , how best to carry it out .
in lowlands areas it is generally accepted that shooting is the most humane method .
but in upland areas like dartmoor and exmoor , shooting is more problematic .
there is a danger in shooting in vast open spaces like the national parks and of hitting other animals and people .
bbc devon environment correspondent simon hall said that the government was trying to remove itself from the firing line over hunting .
mps vote he said : " the government has had a lot of flak about this .
if it devolves the decision to the tribunals , it can step back from it . "
the problem with such a deal is that it could unite two enemies , the countryside alliance and the league against cruel sports .
ivor annetts , mid-devon co-ordinator for the league against cruel sports , told bbc news online : " we are opposed to anything other than an outright ban .
" hunting is no less cruel on dartmoor or exmoor than anywhere else . "
mal treharne , somerset-based policy advisor for the countryside alliance , said : " we can understand why areas like dartmoor and exmoor are being recognised by the govenment as special , regarding hunting , but we can not understand why other areas should not be under the same rules . "
there is also a large majority of mps in the house of commons who want an outright ban .
they could simply amend the bill to ban it totally .

mitsubishi motors , which is 37 % owned by german car firm daimlerchrysler , hauled itself back into profit in the six months to 30 september .
mazda motor posted a four-fold increase in profits for the same period .
mazda has a tie up with us car giant ford , which owns 33.4 % of the japanese firm .
both japanese car makers said their improved performance was partly due to the weak japanese yen , which has helped boost their earnings from overseas sales in recent months .
yen jitters however , fears about a us military onslaught on iraq have been weakening the dollar and strengthening the yen in recent days .
increased domestic demand for japanese cars may therefore be needed to keep the two firms ' recovery on the road .
both firms have been restructuring to cut costs .
mitsubishi motors , which is japan 's fourth biggest car maker , posted net profits of 6.6bn yen -lrb- $ 55.4m ; £ 35m -rrb- for the six months to 30 september .
this contrasts with a loss of 31.5bn yen in the same period of 2001 .
turnaround plans " we have made steady progress in our turnaround plan and work hard to achieve profitability , " the company said .
mitsubishi 's sales were up 5.6 % at 1.62 trillion yen .
at mazda , ranked fifth among japanese car firms , net profit rose to 5.5bn yen , compared to 1.3bn yen in the same six months of last year .
sales rose 12 % to 1.16tillion yen .
mazda president lewis booth said the firm was " achieving sustainable , profitable growth " .
analysts agreed : " it 's impressive to see their aggressiveness in cutting costs , " said hakan hedstrom , a fund manager at commerz international management .

yen jitters however , fears about a us military onslaught on iraq have been weakening the dollar and strengthening the yen in recent days .
increased domestic demand for japanese cars may therefore be needed to keep the two firms ' recovery on the road .
both firms have been restructuring to cut costs .
mitsubishi motors , which is japan 's fourth biggest car maker , posted net profits of 6.6bn yen -lrb- $ 55.4m ; £ 35m -rrb- for the six months to 30 september .
this contrasts with a loss of 31.5bn yen in the same period of 2001 .
turnaround plans " we have made steady progress in our turnaround plan and work hard to achieve profitability , " the company said .
mitsubishi 's sales were up 5.6 % at 1.62 trillion yen .
at mazda , ranked fifth among japanese car firms , net profit rose to 5.5bn yen , compared to 1.3bn yen in the same six months of last year .
sales rose 12 % to 1.16tillion yen .
mazda president lewis booth said the firm was " achieving sustainable , profitable growth " .
analysts agreed : " it 's impressive to see their aggressiveness in cutting costs , " said hakan hedstrom , a fund manager at commerz international management .
