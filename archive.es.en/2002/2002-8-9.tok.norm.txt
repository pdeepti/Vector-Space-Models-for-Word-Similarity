germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .
former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .
he claimed in the süddeutsche zeitung that " every club in the bundesliga " uses indirect payment methods to reduce players ' taxes .
but werner hackmann , the president of the german football league , which operates the bundesliga , dismissed the charge and called the league " clean . "
money is tight in the world of the soccer millionaires football faces a tough test over the coming months as the game across europe feels the pinch of tight budgeting .
the bundesliga is suffering , with only 100 million -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- available for new players this season - a quarter less than in previous years .
the kirch collapse is the main reason behind this with events concerning the fall of the media empire forcing a 20 per cent reduction in income to clubs from televised games .
bskyb pulls plug on media giant kirch to add to woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch and kirch : parting company .
just when it looked like things could n't get any worse , recent reports stated that kirch was edging closer to a complete collapse after it emerged that rupert murdoch ’ s bskyb has exercised an option to sell its stake in insolvent kirchpaytv back to the group .
by withdrawing support , bskyb effectively strangles the financial life out of one of kirch 's last reliable cash injections .
kirch 's flagship , german pay tv channel premiere world which carries the bundesliga games , is held by a separate , wholly owned company and remains on-air for the moment , although it only has enough cash to last until the middle of june .
what happens beyond that date is anyone 's guess .
in a country where football is a religion , the removal of the beautiful game from german screens may have a disastrous effect on a nation 's happiness . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kirch files for insolvency with the kirch group ’ s filing for insolvency in a munich court monday , the scramble for the remains of leo kirch ’ s fallen media empire officially began .
hard times for european soccer soccer may be as popular as ever in europe , especially in the aftermath of the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2002 a delayed revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long ways to go before umts technology hits the market two years ago , when phone companies adopted umts as the new standard in mobile telecommunication , it was regarded as a technological revolution .
today the next generation in cell phones is still in its infancy . two years ago , german telephone companies paid the government a total of some 50 billion euro in license fees for the new mobile connectivity standard umts .
at the time of the purchase , umts was all the rage in mobile phoning .
billed as a technological hyper-revolution for cell phones , the universal mobile telecommunications system allows for data transmission at about 14 times the speed of the current state of the art protocol gprs – and promises to be a stunning 160 times as fast as de facto standard gsm .
there 's only one snag : contrary to earlier announcements , the general public in germany wo n't even see the first umts units until next year .
delayed launch one by one , germany ’ s major telecommunication companies announced they would have to postpone the launch of umts services .
instead of being ready for the market by the start of 2003 as stipulated by the government at the time of purchase , the mobile phone providers have pushed their start days back several months to mid-2003 .
they claim they are not quite ready to introduce the next generation in cell phones .
only vodafone , one of the largest telecoms operating in germany , held steadfastly to the new technology 's capabilities and stubbornly maintained that umts was to become a reality this year .
but on thursday , the ceo of vodafone germany told the daily die welt that the launch was off for the time being .
blaming cell phone producers for the delay , jürgen von kuczkowski said next spring would be the new target date for its umts premiere – now initially restricted to vodafone 's own employees and selected big customers .
kuczowski said phone manufacturers motorola and nokia had not yet delivered satisfactory mobile phones for umts reception , saying they " often ca n't stick to firmly agreed dates and keep postponing the implementation of promised technical features . "
delays are result of poor financial planning but according to the idate institute in france , which monitors developments on the international telecommunications market , the cause for the delay lies elsewhere .
the umts service providers are having a hard time setting up their networks , says carole manero , spokesperson for the institute .
" they 're battling colossal debts and often ca n't afford the investments they 've announced , " she says .
in sweden , for example , the french owned telecom orange has already asked the government whether their umts launch might not be postponed by three years .
" umts is n't a 100 meter sprint , " said kuczkowski .
" a few months are n't an issue . "
but public opinion is another thing .
back in 2000 , an opinion poll by emnid revealed that 71 percent of germans were " probably " or " almost certainly " not going to buy a umts capable phone in the foreseeable future .
umts more expensive than predicted at roughly the same time , cluster consulting was predicting that service operators were going to have to earn about 50 euro per umts customer per month to make their investments in the new network pay off .
in germany , as in the rest of europe , the exorbitant prices paid for the licenses triggered a long downhill slide for telecommunication shares .
between march 2000 and march 2001 , share values for germany 's largest telecommunications provider deutsche telekom dropped by 75 percent , prompting rumors that ceo ron sommer would be forced to resign .
when he did step down about a month ago , the umts investment was widely cited as one of his cardinal errors .

germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .
former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .
he claimed in the süddeutsche zeitung that " every club in the bundesliga " uses indirect payment methods to reduce players ' taxes .
but werner hackmann , the president of the german football league , which operates the bundesliga , dismissed the charge and called the league " clean . "
money is tight in the world of the soccer millionaires football faces a tough test over the coming months as the game across europe feels the pinch of tight budgeting .
the bundesliga is suffering , with only 100 million -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- available for new players this season - a quarter less than in previous years .
the kirch collapse is the main reason behind this with events concerning the fall of the media empire forcing a 20 per cent reduction in income to clubs from televised games .
bskyb pulls plug on media giant kirch to add to woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch and kirch : parting company .
just when it looked like things could n't get any worse , recent reports stated that kirch was edging closer to a complete collapse after it emerged that rupert murdoch ’ s bskyb has exercised an option to sell its stake in insolvent kirchpaytv back to the group .
by withdrawing support , bskyb effectively strangles the financial life out of one of kirch 's last reliable cash injections .
kirch 's flagship , german pay tv channel premiere world which carries the bundesliga games , is held by a separate , wholly owned company and remains on-air for the moment , although it only has enough cash to last until the middle of june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2002 a delayed revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long ways to go before umts technology hits the market two years ago , when phone companies adopted umts as the new standard in mobile telecommunication , it was regarded as a technological revolution .
today the next generation in cell phones is still in its infancy . two years ago , german telephone companies paid the government a total of some 50 billion euro in license fees for the new mobile connectivity standard umts .
at the time of the purchase , umts was all the rage in mobile phoning .
billed as a technological hyper-revolution for cell phones , the universal mobile telecommunications system allows for data transmission at about 14 times the speed of the current state of the art protocol gprs – and promises to be a stunning 160 times as fast as de facto standard gsm .
there 's only one snag : contrary to earlier announcements , the general public in germany wo n't even see the first umts units until next year .
delayed launch one by one , germany ’ s major telecommunication companies announced they would have to postpone the launch of umts services .
instead of being ready for the market by the start of 2003 as stipulated by the government at the time of purchase , the mobile phone providers have pushed their start days back several months to mid-2003 .
they claim they are not quite ready to introduce the next generation in cell phones .
only vodafone , one of the largest telecoms operating in germany , held steadfastly to the new technology 's capabilities and stubbornly maintained that umts was to become a reality this year .
but on thursday , the ceo of vodafone germany told the daily die welt that the launch was off for the time being .
blaming cell phone producers for the delay , jürgen von kuczkowski said next spring would be the new target date for its umts premiere – now initially restricted to vodafone 's own employees and selected big customers .
kuczowski said phone manufacturers motorola and nokia had not yet delivered satisfactory mobile phones for umts reception , saying they " often ca n't stick to firmly agreed dates and keep postponing the implementation of promised technical features . "
delays are result of poor financial planning but according to the idate institute in france , which monitors developments on the international telecommunications market , the cause for the delay lies elsewhere .
the umts service providers are having a hard time setting up their networks , says carole manero , spokesperson for the institute .
" they 're battling colossal debts and often ca n't afford the investments they 've announced , " she says .
in sweden , for example , the french owned telecom orange has already asked the government whether their umts launch might not be postponed by three years .
" umts is n't a 100 meter sprint , " said kuczkowski .
" a few months are n't an issue . "
but public opinion is another thing .
back in 2000 , an opinion poll by emnid revealed that 71 percent of germans were " probably " or " almost certainly " not going to buy a umts capable phone in the foreseeable future .
umts more expensive than predicted at roughly the same time , cluster consulting was predicting that service operators were going to have to earn about 50 euro per umts customer per month to make their investments in the new network pay off .
in germany , as in the rest of europe , the exorbitant prices paid for the licenses triggered a long downhill slide for telecommunication shares .
between march 2000 and march 2001 , share values for germany 's largest telecommunications provider deutsche telekom dropped by 75 percent , prompting rumors that ceo ron sommer would be forced to resign .
when he did step down about a month ago , the umts investment was widely cited as one of his cardinal errors .
die welt termed the entire project a " giant building site " that would n't yield profits for years to come .

germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .

former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .

germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .
former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .
he claimed in the süddeutsche zeitung that " every club in the bundesliga " uses indirect payment methods to reduce players ' taxes .
but werner hackmann , the president of the german football league , which operates the bundesliga , dismissed the charge and called the league " clean . "
money is tight in the world of the soccer millionaires football faces a tough test over the coming months as the game across europe feels the pinch of tight budgeting .
the bundesliga is suffering , with only 100 million -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- available for new players this season - a quarter less than in previous years .

today the next generation in cell phones is still in its infancy . two years ago , german telephone companies paid the government a total of some 50 billion euro in license fees for the new mobile connectivity standard umts .
at the time of the purchase , umts was all the rage in mobile phoning .
billed as a technological hyper-revolution for cell phones , the universal mobile telecommunications system allows for data transmission at about 14 times the speed of the current state of the art protocol gprs – and promises to be a stunning 160 times as fast as de facto standard gsm .
there 's only one snag : contrary to earlier announcements , the general public in germany wo n't even see the first umts units until next year .
delayed launch one by one , germany ’ s major telecommunication companies announced they would have to postpone the launch of umts services .
instead of being ready for the market by the start of 2003 as stipulated by the government at the time of purchase , the mobile phone providers have pushed their start days back several months to mid-2003 .
they claim they are not quite ready to introduce the next generation in cell phones .
only vodafone , one of the largest telecoms operating in germany , held steadfastly to the new technology 's capabilities and stubbornly maintained that umts was to become a reality this year .
but on thursday , the ceo of vodafone germany told the daily die welt that the launch was off for the time being .
blaming cell phone producers for the delay , jürgen von kuczkowski said next spring would be the new target date for its umts premiere – now initially restricted to vodafone 's own employees and selected big customers .
kuczowski said phone manufacturers motorola and nokia had not yet delivered satisfactory mobile phones for umts reception , saying they " often ca n't stick to firmly agreed dates and keep postponing the implementation of promised technical features . "
delays are result of poor financial planning but according to the idate institute in france , which monitors developments on the international telecommunications market , the cause for the delay lies elsewhere .
the umts service providers are having a hard time setting up their networks , says carole manero , spokesperson for the institute .
" they 're battling colossal debts and often ca n't afford the investments they 've announced , " she says .
in sweden , for example , the french owned telecom orange has already asked the government whether their umts launch might not be postponed by three years .
" umts is n't a 100 meter sprint , " said kuczkowski .
" a few months are n't an issue . "
but public opinion is another thing .
back in 2000 , an opinion poll by emnid revealed that 71 percent of germans were " probably " or " almost certainly " not going to buy a umts capable phone in the foreseeable future .
umts more expensive than predicted at roughly the same time , cluster consulting was predicting that service operators were going to have to earn about 50 euro per umts customer per month to make their investments in the new network pay off .
in germany , as in the rest of europe , the exorbitant prices paid for the licenses triggered a long downhill slide for telecommunication shares .
between march 2000 and march 2001 , share values for germany 's largest telecommunications provider deutsche telekom dropped by 75 percent , prompting rumors that ceo ron sommer would be forced to resign .
when he did step down about a month ago , the umts investment was widely cited as one of his cardinal errors .
die welt termed the entire project a " giant building site " that would n't yield profits for years to come .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2002 a delayed revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long ways to go before umts technology hits the market two years ago , when phone companies adopted umts as the new standard in mobile telecommunication , it was regarded as a technological revolution .
today the next generation in cell phones is still in its infancy . two years ago , german telephone companies paid the government a total of some 50 billion euro in license fees for the new mobile connectivity standard umts .
at the time of the purchase , umts was all the rage in mobile phoning .
billed as a technological hyper-revolution for cell phones , the universal mobile telecommunications system allows for data transmission at about 14 times the speed of the current state of the art protocol gprs – and promises to be a stunning 160 times as fast as de facto standard gsm .
there 's only one snag : contrary to earlier announcements , the general public in germany wo n't even see the first umts units until next year .
delayed launch one by one , germany ’ s major telecommunication companies announced they would have to postpone the launch of umts services .
instead of being ready for the market by the start of 2003 as stipulated by the government at the time of purchase , the mobile phone providers have pushed their start days back several months to mid-2003 .
they claim they are not quite ready to introduce the next generation in cell phones .
only vodafone , one of the largest telecoms operating in germany , held steadfastly to the new technology 's capabilities and stubbornly maintained that umts was to become a reality this year .
but on thursday , the ceo of vodafone germany told the daily die welt that the launch was off for the time being .
blaming cell phone producers for the delay , jürgen von kuczkowski said next spring would be the new target date for its umts premiere – now initially restricted to vodafone 's own employees and selected big customers .
kuczowski said phone manufacturers motorola and nokia had not yet delivered satisfactory mobile phones for umts reception , saying they " often ca n't stick to firmly agreed dates and keep postponing the implementation of promised technical features . "
delays are result of poor financial planning but according to the idate institute in france , which monitors developments on the international telecommunications market , the cause for the delay lies elsewhere .
the umts service providers are having a hard time setting up their networks , says carole manero , spokesperson for the institute .
" they 're battling colossal debts and often ca n't afford the investments they 've announced , " she says .
in sweden , for example , the french owned telecom orange has already asked the government whether their umts launch might not be postponed by three years .
" umts is n't a 100 meter sprint , " said kuczkowski .
" a few months are n't an issue . "
but public opinion is another thing .
back in 2000 , an opinion poll by emnid revealed that 71 percent of germans were " probably " or " almost certainly " not going to buy a umts capable phone in the foreseeable future .
umts more expensive than predicted at roughly the same time , cluster consulting was predicting that service operators were going to have to earn about 50 euro per umts customer per month to make their investments in the new network pay off .
in germany , as in the rest of europe , the exorbitant prices paid for the licenses triggered a long downhill slide for telecommunication shares .
between march 2000 and march 2001 , share values for germany 's largest telecommunications provider deutsche telekom dropped by 75 percent , prompting rumors that ceo ron sommer would be forced to resign .
when he did step down about a month ago , the umts investment was widely cited as one of his cardinal errors .

germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .
former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .
he claimed in the süddeutsche zeitung that " every club in the bundesliga " uses indirect payment methods to reduce players ' taxes .
but werner hackmann , the president of the german football league , which operates the bundesliga , dismissed the charge and called the league " clean . "
money is tight in the world of the soccer millionaires football faces a tough test over the coming months as the game across europe feels the pinch of tight budgeting .
the bundesliga is suffering , with only 100 million -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- available for new players this season - a quarter less than in previous years .
the kirch collapse is the main reason behind this with events concerning the fall of the media empire forcing a 20 per cent reduction in income to clubs from televised games .
bskyb pulls plug on media giant kirch to add to woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch and kirch : parting company .
just when it looked like things could n't get any worse , recent reports stated that kirch was edging closer to a complete collapse after it emerged that rupert murdoch ’ s bskyb has exercised an option to sell its stake in insolvent kirchpaytv back to the group .
by withdrawing support , bskyb effectively strangles the financial life out of one of kirch 's last reliable cash injections .
kirch 's flagship , german pay tv channel premiere world which carries the bundesliga games , is held by a separate , wholly owned company and remains on-air for the moment , although it only has enough cash to last until the middle of june .
what happens beyond that date is anyone 's guess .
in a country where football is a religion , the removal of the beautiful game from german screens may have a disastrous effect on a nation 's happiness . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kirch files for insolvency with the kirch group ’ s filing for insolvency in a munich court monday , the scramble for the remains of leo kirch ’ s fallen media empire officially began .

germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .
former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .
he claimed in the süddeutsche zeitung that " every club in the bundesliga " uses indirect payment methods to reduce players ' taxes .
but werner hackmann , the president of the german football league , which operates the bundesliga , dismissed the charge and called the league " clean . "
money is tight in the world of the soccer millionaires football faces a tough test over the coming months as the game across europe feels the pinch of tight budgeting .
the bundesliga is suffering , with only 100 million -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- available for new players this season - a quarter less than in previous years .
the kirch collapse is the main reason behind this with events concerning the fall of the media empire forcing a 20 per cent reduction in income to clubs from televised games .
bskyb pulls plug on media giant kirch to add to woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch and kirch : parting company .
just when it looked like things could n't get any worse , recent reports stated that kirch was edging closer to a complete collapse after it emerged that rupert murdoch ’ s bskyb has exercised an option to sell its stake in insolvent kirchpaytv back to the group .
by withdrawing support , bskyb effectively strangles the financial life out of one of kirch 's last reliable cash injections .
kirch 's flagship , german pay tv channel premiere world which carries the bundesliga games , is held by a separate , wholly owned company and remains on-air for the moment , although it only has enough cash to last until the middle of june .
what happens beyond that date is anyone 's guess .

germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .
former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2002 a delayed revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long ways to go before umts technology hits the market two years ago , when phone companies adopted umts as the new standard in mobile telecommunication , it was regarded as a technological revolution .
today the next generation in cell phones is still in its infancy . two years ago , german telephone companies paid the government a total of some 50 billion euro in license fees for the new mobile connectivity standard umts .
at the time of the purchase , umts was all the rage in mobile phoning .
billed as a technological hyper-revolution for cell phones , the universal mobile telecommunications system allows for data transmission at about 14 times the speed of the current state of the art protocol gprs – and promises to be a stunning 160 times as fast as de facto standard gsm .
there 's only one snag : contrary to earlier announcements , the general public in germany wo n't even see the first umts units until next year .
delayed launch one by one , germany ’ s major telecommunication companies announced they would have to postpone the launch of umts services .
instead of being ready for the market by the start of 2003 as stipulated by the government at the time of purchase , the mobile phone providers have pushed their start days back several months to mid-2003 .
they claim they are not quite ready to introduce the next generation in cell phones .
only vodafone , one of the largest telecoms operating in germany , held steadfastly to the new technology 's capabilities and stubbornly maintained that umts was to become a reality this year .
but on thursday , the ceo of vodafone germany told the daily die welt that the launch was off for the time being .
blaming cell phone producers for the delay , jürgen von kuczkowski said next spring would be the new target date for its umts premiere – now initially restricted to vodafone 's own employees and selected big customers .
kuczowski said phone manufacturers motorola and nokia had not yet delivered satisfactory mobile phones for umts reception , saying they " often ca n't stick to firmly agreed dates and keep postponing the implementation of promised technical features . "
delays are result of poor financial planning but according to the idate institute in france , which monitors developments on the international telecommunications market , the cause for the delay lies elsewhere .
the umts service providers are having a hard time setting up their networks , says carole manero , spokesperson for the institute .
" they 're battling colossal debts and often ca n't afford the investments they 've announced , " she says .
in sweden , for example , the french owned telecom orange has already asked the government whether their umts launch might not be postponed by three years .
" umts is n't a 100 meter sprint , " said kuczkowski .
" a few months are n't an issue . "
but public opinion is another thing .
back in 2000 , an opinion poll by emnid revealed that 71 percent of germans were " probably " or " almost certainly " not going to buy a umts capable phone in the foreseeable future .
umts more expensive than predicted at roughly the same time , cluster consulting was predicting that service operators were going to have to earn about 50 euro per umts customer per month to make their investments in the new network pay off .
in germany , as in the rest of europe , the exorbitant prices paid for the licenses triggered a long downhill slide for telecommunication shares .
between march 2000 and march 2001 , share values for germany 's largest telecommunications provider deutsche telekom dropped by 75 percent , prompting rumors that ceo ron sommer would be forced to resign .
when he did step down about a month ago , the umts investment was widely cited as one of his cardinal errors .
die welt termed the entire project a " giant building site " that would n't yield profits for years to come .

already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .

as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .
he claimed in the süddeutsche zeitung that " every club in the bundesliga " uses indirect payment methods to reduce players ' taxes .
but werner hackmann , the president of the german football league , which operates the bundesliga , dismissed the charge and called the league " clean . "
money is tight in the world of the soccer millionaires football faces a tough test over the coming months as the game across europe feels the pinch of tight budgeting .
the bundesliga is suffering , with only 100 million -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- available for new players this season - a quarter less than in previous years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2002 a delayed revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long ways to go before umts technology hits the market two years ago , when phone companies adopted umts as the new standard in mobile telecommunication , it was regarded as a technological revolution .
today the next generation in cell phones is still in its infancy . two years ago , german telephone companies paid the government a total of some 50 billion euro in license fees for the new mobile connectivity standard umts .
at the time of the purchase , umts was all the rage in mobile phoning .
billed as a technological hyper-revolution for cell phones , the universal mobile telecommunications system allows for data transmission at about 14 times the speed of the current state of the art protocol gprs – and promises to be a stunning 160 times as fast as de facto standard gsm .
there 's only one snag : contrary to earlier announcements , the general public in germany wo n't even see the first umts units until next year .
delayed launch one by one , germany ’ s major telecommunication companies announced they would have to postpone the launch of umts services .
instead of being ready for the market by the start of 2003 as stipulated by the government at the time of purchase , the mobile phone providers have pushed their start days back several months to mid-2003 .
they claim they are not quite ready to introduce the next generation in cell phones .
only vodafone , one of the largest telecoms operating in germany , held steadfastly to the new technology 's capabilities and stubbornly maintained that umts was to become a reality this year .
but on thursday , the ceo of vodafone germany told the daily die welt that the launch was off for the time being .
blaming cell phone producers for the delay , jürgen von kuczkowski said next spring would be the new target date for its umts premiere – now initially restricted to vodafone 's own employees and selected big customers .
kuczowski said phone manufacturers motorola and nokia had not yet delivered satisfactory mobile phones for umts reception , saying they " often ca n't stick to firmly agreed dates and keep postponing the implementation of promised technical features . "
delays are result of poor financial planning but according to the idate institute in france , which monitors developments on the international telecommunications market , the cause for the delay lies elsewhere .
the umts service providers are having a hard time setting up their networks , says carole manero , spokesperson for the institute .
" they 're battling colossal debts and often ca n't afford the investments they 've announced , " she says .
in sweden , for example , the french owned telecom orange has already asked the government whether their umts launch might not be postponed by three years .
" umts is n't a 100 meter sprint , " said kuczkowski .
" a few months are n't an issue . "
but public opinion is another thing .
back in 2000 , an opinion poll by emnid revealed that 71 percent of germans were " probably " or " almost certainly " not going to buy a umts capable phone in the foreseeable future .
umts more expensive than predicted at roughly the same time , cluster consulting was predicting that service operators were going to have to earn about 50 euro per umts customer per month to make their investments in the new network pay off .
in germany , as in the rest of europe , the exorbitant prices paid for the licenses triggered a long downhill slide for telecommunication shares .
between march 2000 and march 2001 , share values for germany 's largest telecommunications provider deutsche telekom dropped by 75 percent , prompting rumors that ceo ron sommer would be forced to resign .
when he did step down about a month ago , the umts investment was widely cited as one of his cardinal errors .
die welt termed the entire project a " giant building site " that would n't yield profits for years to come .
and if that 's the case , consumers are unlikely to see the first units any time soon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paying billions to make trillions the next generation of mobile phones will allow users to send video emails and surf the net at lightning speed .

germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .
former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .
he claimed in the süddeutsche zeitung that " every club in the bundesliga " uses indirect payment methods to reduce players ' taxes .
but werner hackmann , the president of the german football league , which operates the bundesliga , dismissed the charge and called the league " clean . "
money is tight in the world of the soccer millionaires football faces a tough test over the coming months as the game across europe feels the pinch of tight budgeting .
the bundesliga is suffering , with only 100 million -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- available for new players this season - a quarter less than in previous years .
the kirch collapse is the main reason behind this with events concerning the fall of the media empire forcing a 20 per cent reduction in income to clubs from televised games .
bskyb pulls plug on media giant kirch to add to woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch and kirch : parting company .
just when it looked like things could n't get any worse , recent reports stated that kirch was edging closer to a complete collapse after it emerged that rupert murdoch ’ s bskyb has exercised an option to sell its stake in insolvent kirchpaytv back to the group .
by withdrawing support , bskyb effectively strangles the financial life out of one of kirch 's last reliable cash injections .
kirch 's flagship , german pay tv channel premiere world which carries the bundesliga games , is held by a separate , wholly owned company and remains on-air for the moment , although it only has enough cash to last until the middle of june .
what happens beyond that date is anyone 's guess .
in a country where football is a religion , the removal of the beautiful game from german screens may have a disastrous effect on a nation 's happiness . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kirch files for insolvency with the kirch group ’ s filing for insolvency in a munich court monday , the scramble for the remains of leo kirch ’ s fallen media empire officially began .

today the next generation in cell phones is still in its infancy . two years ago , german telephone companies paid the government a total of some 50 billion euro in license fees for the new mobile connectivity standard umts .
at the time of the purchase , umts was all the rage in mobile phoning .
billed as a technological hyper-revolution for cell phones , the universal mobile telecommunications system allows for data transmission at about 14 times the speed of the current state of the art protocol gprs – and promises to be a stunning 160 times as fast as de facto standard gsm .
there 's only one snag : contrary to earlier announcements , the general public in germany wo n't even see the first umts units until next year .
delayed launch one by one , germany ’ s major telecommunication companies announced they would have to postpone the launch of umts services .
instead of being ready for the market by the start of 2003 as stipulated by the government at the time of purchase , the mobile phone providers have pushed their start days back several months to mid-2003 .
they claim they are not quite ready to introduce the next generation in cell phones .
only vodafone , one of the largest telecoms operating in germany , held steadfastly to the new technology 's capabilities and stubbornly maintained that umts was to become a reality this year .
but on thursday , the ceo of vodafone germany told the daily die welt that the launch was off for the time being .
blaming cell phone producers for the delay , jürgen von kuczkowski said next spring would be the new target date for its umts premiere – now initially restricted to vodafone 's own employees and selected big customers .
kuczowski said phone manufacturers motorola and nokia had not yet delivered satisfactory mobile phones for umts reception , saying they " often ca n't stick to firmly agreed dates and keep postponing the implementation of promised technical features . "
delays are result of poor financial planning but according to the idate institute in france , which monitors developments on the international telecommunications market , the cause for the delay lies elsewhere .
the umts service providers are having a hard time setting up their networks , says carole manero , spokesperson for the institute .
" they 're battling colossal debts and often ca n't afford the investments they 've announced , " she says .
in sweden , for example , the french owned telecom orange has already asked the government whether their umts launch might not be postponed by three years .
" umts is n't a 100 meter sprint , " said kuczkowski .
" a few months are n't an issue . "
but public opinion is another thing .
back in 2000 , an opinion poll by emnid revealed that 71 percent of germans were " probably " or " almost certainly " not going to buy a umts capable phone in the foreseeable future .
umts more expensive than predicted at roughly the same time , cluster consulting was predicting that service operators were going to have to earn about 50 euro per umts customer per month to make their investments in the new network pay off .
in germany , as in the rest of europe , the exorbitant prices paid for the licenses triggered a long downhill slide for telecommunication shares .
between march 2000 and march 2001 , share values for germany 's largest telecommunications provider deutsche telekom dropped by 75 percent , prompting rumors that ceo ron sommer would be forced to resign .
when he did step down about a month ago , the umts investment was widely cited as one of his cardinal errors .
die welt termed the entire project a " giant building site " that would n't yield profits for years to come .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2002 a delayed revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long ways to go before umts technology hits the market two years ago , when phone companies adopted umts as the new standard in mobile telecommunication , it was regarded as a technological revolution .
today the next generation in cell phones is still in its infancy . two years ago , german telephone companies paid the government a total of some 50 billion euro in license fees for the new mobile connectivity standard umts .
at the time of the purchase , umts was all the rage in mobile phoning .
billed as a technological hyper-revolution for cell phones , the universal mobile telecommunications system allows for data transmission at about 14 times the speed of the current state of the art protocol gprs – and promises to be a stunning 160 times as fast as de facto standard gsm .
there 's only one snag : contrary to earlier announcements , the general public in germany wo n't even see the first umts units until next year .
delayed launch one by one , germany ’ s major telecommunication companies announced they would have to postpone the launch of umts services .
instead of being ready for the market by the start of 2003 as stipulated by the government at the time of purchase , the mobile phone providers have pushed their start days back several months to mid-2003 .
they claim they are not quite ready to introduce the next generation in cell phones .
only vodafone , one of the largest telecoms operating in germany , held steadfastly to the new technology 's capabilities and stubbornly maintained that umts was to become a reality this year .
but on thursday , the ceo of vodafone germany told the daily die welt that the launch was off for the time being .
blaming cell phone producers for the delay , jürgen von kuczkowski said next spring would be the new target date for its umts premiere – now initially restricted to vodafone 's own employees and selected big customers .
kuczowski said phone manufacturers motorola and nokia had not yet delivered satisfactory mobile phones for umts reception , saying they " often ca n't stick to firmly agreed dates and keep postponing the implementation of promised technical features . "
delays are result of poor financial planning but according to the idate institute in france , which monitors developments on the international telecommunications market , the cause for the delay lies elsewhere .
the umts service providers are having a hard time setting up their networks , says carole manero , spokesperson for the institute .
" they 're battling colossal debts and often ca n't afford the investments they 've announced , " she says .
in sweden , for example , the french owned telecom orange has already asked the government whether their umts launch might not be postponed by three years .
" umts is n't a 100 meter sprint , " said kuczkowski .
" a few months are n't an issue . "
but public opinion is another thing .
back in 2000 , an opinion poll by emnid revealed that 71 percent of germans were " probably " or " almost certainly " not going to buy a umts capable phone in the foreseeable future .
umts more expensive than predicted at roughly the same time , cluster consulting was predicting that service operators were going to have to earn about 50 euro per umts customer per month to make their investments in the new network pay off .
in germany , as in the rest of europe , the exorbitant prices paid for the licenses triggered a long downhill slide for telecommunication shares .
between march 2000 and march 2001 , share values for germany 's largest telecommunications provider deutsche telekom dropped by 75 percent , prompting rumors that ceo ron sommer would be forced to resign .
when he did step down about a month ago , the umts investment was widely cited as one of his cardinal errors .

germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .
former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .
he claimed in the süddeutsche zeitung that " every club in the bundesliga " uses indirect payment methods to reduce players ' taxes .
but werner hackmann , the president of the german football league , which operates the bundesliga , dismissed the charge and called the league " clean . "
money is tight in the world of the soccer millionaires football faces a tough test over the coming months as the game across europe feels the pinch of tight budgeting .
the bundesliga is suffering , with only 100 million -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- available for new players this season - a quarter less than in previous years .
the kirch collapse is the main reason behind this with events concerning the fall of the media empire forcing a 20 per cent reduction in income to clubs from televised games .
bskyb pulls plug on media giant kirch to add to woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch and kirch : parting company .
just when it looked like things could n't get any worse , recent reports stated that kirch was edging closer to a complete collapse after it emerged that rupert murdoch ’ s bskyb has exercised an option to sell its stake in insolvent kirchpaytv back to the group .
by withdrawing support , bskyb effectively strangles the financial life out of one of kirch 's last reliable cash injections .
kirch 's flagship , german pay tv channel premiere world which carries the bundesliga games , is held by a separate , wholly owned company and remains on-air for the moment , although it only has enough cash to last until the middle of june .

germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .
former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .
he claimed in the süddeutsche zeitung that " every club in the bundesliga " uses indirect payment methods to reduce players ' taxes .
but werner hackmann , the president of the german football league , which operates the bundesliga , dismissed the charge and called the league " clean . "
money is tight in the world of the soccer millionaires football faces a tough test over the coming months as the game across europe feels the pinch of tight budgeting .
the bundesliga is suffering , with only 100 million -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- available for new players this season - a quarter less than in previous years .
the kirch collapse is the main reason behind this with events concerning the fall of the media empire forcing a 20 per cent reduction in income to clubs from televised games .
bskyb pulls plug on media giant kirch to add to woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch and kirch : parting company .
just when it looked like things could n't get any worse , recent reports stated that kirch was edging closer to a complete collapse after it emerged that rupert murdoch ’ s bskyb has exercised an option to sell its stake in insolvent kirchpaytv back to the group .
by withdrawing support , bskyb effectively strangles the financial life out of one of kirch 's last reliable cash injections .
kirch 's flagship , german pay tv channel premiere world which carries the bundesliga games , is held by a separate , wholly owned company and remains on-air for the moment , although it only has enough cash to last until the middle of june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2002 a delayed revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long ways to go before umts technology hits the market two years ago , when phone companies adopted umts as the new standard in mobile telecommunication , it was regarded as a technological revolution .
today the next generation in cell phones is still in its infancy . two years ago , german telephone companies paid the government a total of some 50 billion euro in license fees for the new mobile connectivity standard umts .
at the time of the purchase , umts was all the rage in mobile phoning .
billed as a technological hyper-revolution for cell phones , the universal mobile telecommunications system allows for data transmission at about 14 times the speed of the current state of the art protocol gprs – and promises to be a stunning 160 times as fast as de facto standard gsm .
there 's only one snag : contrary to earlier announcements , the general public in germany wo n't even see the first umts units until next year .
delayed launch one by one , germany ’ s major telecommunication companies announced they would have to postpone the launch of umts services .
instead of being ready for the market by the start of 2003 as stipulated by the government at the time of purchase , the mobile phone providers have pushed their start days back several months to mid-2003 .
they claim they are not quite ready to introduce the next generation in cell phones .
only vodafone , one of the largest telecoms operating in germany , held steadfastly to the new technology 's capabilities and stubbornly maintained that umts was to become a reality this year .
but on thursday , the ceo of vodafone germany told the daily die welt that the launch was off for the time being .
blaming cell phone producers for the delay , jürgen von kuczkowski said next spring would be the new target date for its umts premiere – now initially restricted to vodafone 's own employees and selected big customers .
kuczowski said phone manufacturers motorola and nokia had not yet delivered satisfactory mobile phones for umts reception , saying they " often ca n't stick to firmly agreed dates and keep postponing the implementation of promised technical features . "
delays are result of poor financial planning but according to the idate institute in france , which monitors developments on the international telecommunications market , the cause for the delay lies elsewhere .
the umts service providers are having a hard time setting up their networks , says carole manero , spokesperson for the institute .
" they 're battling colossal debts and often ca n't afford the investments they 've announced , " she says .
in sweden , for example , the french owned telecom orange has already asked the government whether their umts launch might not be postponed by three years .
" umts is n't a 100 meter sprint , " said kuczkowski .
" a few months are n't an issue . "
but public opinion is another thing .
back in 2000 , an opinion poll by emnid revealed that 71 percent of germans were " probably " or " almost certainly " not going to buy a umts capable phone in the foreseeable future .
umts more expensive than predicted at roughly the same time , cluster consulting was predicting that service operators were going to have to earn about 50 euro per umts customer per month to make their investments in the new network pay off .
in germany , as in the rest of europe , the exorbitant prices paid for the licenses triggered a long downhill slide for telecommunication shares .
between march 2000 and march 2001 , share values for germany 's largest telecommunications provider deutsche telekom dropped by 75 percent , prompting rumors that ceo ron sommer would be forced to resign .
when he did step down about a month ago , the umts investment was widely cited as one of his cardinal errors .
die welt termed the entire project a " giant building site " that would n't yield profits for years to come .
and if that 's the case , consumers are unlikely to see the first units any time soon . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paying billions to make trillions the next generation of mobile phones will allow users to send video emails and surf the net at lightning speed .

blaming cell phone producers for the delay , jürgen von kuczkowski said next spring would be the new target date for its umts premiere – now initially restricted to vodafone 's own employees and selected big customers .
kuczowski said phone manufacturers motorola and nokia had not yet delivered satisfactory mobile phones for umts reception , saying they " often ca n't stick to firmly agreed dates and keep postponing the implementation of promised technical features . "
delays are result of poor financial planning but according to the idate institute in france , which monitors developments on the international telecommunications market , the cause for the delay lies elsewhere .
the umts service providers are having a hard time setting up their networks , says carole manero , spokesperson for the institute .
" they 're battling colossal debts and often ca n't afford the investments they 've announced , " she says .
in sweden , for example , the french owned telecom orange has already asked the government whether their umts launch might not be postponed by three years .
" umts is n't a 100 meter sprint , " said kuczkowski .
" a few months are n't an issue . "
but public opinion is another thing .
back in 2000 , an opinion poll by emnid revealed that 71 percent of germans were " probably " or " almost certainly " not going to buy a umts capable phone in the foreseeable future .
umts more expensive than predicted at roughly the same time , cluster consulting was predicting that service operators were going to have to earn about 50 euro per umts customer per month to make their investments in the new network pay off .
in germany , as in the rest of europe , the exorbitant prices paid for the licenses triggered a long downhill slide for telecommunication shares .
between march 2000 and march 2001 , share values for germany 's largest telecommunications provider deutsche telekom dropped by 75 percent , prompting rumors that ceo ron sommer would be forced to resign .
when he did step down about a month ago , the umts investment was widely cited as one of his cardinal errors .

germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .
former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .
he claimed in the süddeutsche zeitung that " every club in the bundesliga " uses indirect payment methods to reduce players ' taxes .
but werner hackmann , the president of the german football league , which operates the bundesliga , dismissed the charge and called the league " clean . "
money is tight in the world of the soccer millionaires football faces a tough test over the coming months as the game across europe feels the pinch of tight budgeting .
the bundesliga is suffering , with only 100 million -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- available for new players this season - a quarter less than in previous years .
the kirch collapse is the main reason behind this with events concerning the fall of the media empire forcing a 20 per cent reduction in income to clubs from televised games .
bskyb pulls plug on media giant kirch to add to woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch and kirch : parting company .
just when it looked like things could n't get any worse , recent reports stated that kirch was edging closer to a complete collapse after it emerged that rupert murdoch ’ s bskyb has exercised an option to sell its stake in insolvent kirchpaytv back to the group .
by withdrawing support , bskyb effectively strangles the financial life out of one of kirch 's last reliable cash injections .
kirch 's flagship , german pay tv channel premiere world which carries the bundesliga games , is held by a separate , wholly owned company and remains on-air for the moment , although it only has enough cash to last until the middle of june .
what happens beyond that date is anyone 's guess .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.08.2002 a delayed revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a long ways to go before umts technology hits the market two years ago , when phone companies adopted umts as the new standard in mobile telecommunication , it was regarded as a technological revolution .
today the next generation in cell phones is still in its infancy . two years ago , german telephone companies paid the government a total of some 50 billion euro in license fees for the new mobile connectivity standard umts .
at the time of the purchase , umts was all the rage in mobile phoning .
billed as a technological hyper-revolution for cell phones , the universal mobile telecommunications system allows for data transmission at about 14 times the speed of the current state of the art protocol gprs – and promises to be a stunning 160 times as fast as de facto standard gsm .
there 's only one snag : contrary to earlier announcements , the general public in germany wo n't even see the first umts units until next year .
delayed launch one by one , germany ’ s major telecommunication companies announced they would have to postpone the launch of umts services .
instead of being ready for the market by the start of 2003 as stipulated by the government at the time of purchase , the mobile phone providers have pushed their start days back several months to mid-2003 .
they claim they are not quite ready to introduce the next generation in cell phones .
only vodafone , one of the largest telecoms operating in germany , held steadfastly to the new technology 's capabilities and stubbornly maintained that umts was to become a reality this year .
but on thursday , the ceo of vodafone germany told the daily die welt that the launch was off for the time being .

germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .
former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .
he claimed in the süddeutsche zeitung that " every club in the bundesliga " uses indirect payment methods to reduce players ' taxes .
but werner hackmann , the president of the german football league , which operates the bundesliga , dismissed the charge and called the league " clean . "
money is tight in the world of the soccer millionaires football faces a tough test over the coming months as the game across europe feels the pinch of tight budgeting .
the bundesliga is suffering , with only 100 million -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- available for new players this season - a quarter less than in previous years .
the kirch collapse is the main reason behind this with events concerning the fall of the media empire forcing a 20 per cent reduction in income to clubs from televised games .
bskyb pulls plug on media giant kirch to add to woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch and kirch : parting company .
just when it looked like things could n't get any worse , recent reports stated that kirch was edging closer to a complete collapse after it emerged that rupert murdoch ’ s bskyb has exercised an option to sell its stake in insolvent kirchpaytv back to the group .
by withdrawing support , bskyb effectively strangles the financial life out of one of kirch 's last reliable cash injections .
kirch 's flagship , german pay tv channel premiere world which carries the bundesliga games , is held by a separate , wholly owned company and remains on-air for the moment , although it only has enough cash to last until the middle of june .
what happens beyond that date is anyone 's guess .
in a country where football is a religion , the removal of the beautiful game from german screens may have a disastrous effect on a nation 's happiness . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kirch files for insolvency with the kirch group ’ s filing for insolvency in a munich court monday , the scramble for the remains of leo kirch ’ s fallen media empire officially began .

today the next generation in cell phones is still in its infancy . two years ago , german telephone companies paid the government a total of some 50 billion euro in license fees for the new mobile connectivity standard umts .
at the time of the purchase , umts was all the rage in mobile phoning .
billed as a technological hyper-revolution for cell phones , the universal mobile telecommunications system allows for data transmission at about 14 times the speed of the current state of the art protocol gprs – and promises to be a stunning 160 times as fast as de facto standard gsm .
there 's only one snag : contrary to earlier announcements , the general public in germany wo n't even see the first umts units until next year .
delayed launch one by one , germany ’ s major telecommunication companies announced they would have to postpone the launch of umts services .
instead of being ready for the market by the start of 2003 as stipulated by the government at the time of purchase , the mobile phone providers have pushed their start days back several months to mid-2003 .
they claim they are not quite ready to introduce the next generation in cell phones .
only vodafone , one of the largest telecoms operating in germany , held steadfastly to the new technology 's capabilities and stubbornly maintained that umts was to become a reality this year .
but on thursday , the ceo of vodafone germany told the daily die welt that the launch was off for the time being .
blaming cell phone producers for the delay , jürgen von kuczkowski said next spring would be the new target date for its umts premiere – now initially restricted to vodafone 's own employees and selected big customers .
kuczowski said phone manufacturers motorola and nokia had not yet delivered satisfactory mobile phones for umts reception , saying they " often ca n't stick to firmly agreed dates and keep postponing the implementation of promised technical features . "
delays are result of poor financial planning but according to the idate institute in france , which monitors developments on the international telecommunications market , the cause for the delay lies elsewhere .
the umts service providers are having a hard time setting up their networks , says carole manero , spokesperson for the institute .
" they 're battling colossal debts and often ca n't afford the investments they 've announced , " she says .
in sweden , for example , the french owned telecom orange has already asked the government whether their umts launch might not be postponed by three years .
" umts is n't a 100 meter sprint , " said kuczkowski .
" a few months are n't an issue . "
but public opinion is another thing .
back in 2000 , an opinion poll by emnid revealed that 71 percent of germans were " probably " or " almost certainly " not going to buy a umts capable phone in the foreseeable future .
umts more expensive than predicted at roughly the same time , cluster consulting was predicting that service operators were going to have to earn about 50 euro per umts customer per month to make their investments in the new network pay off .
in germany , as in the rest of europe , the exorbitant prices paid for the licenses triggered a long downhill slide for telecommunication shares .
between march 2000 and march 2001 , share values for germany 's largest telecommunications provider deutsche telekom dropped by 75 percent , prompting rumors that ceo ron sommer would be forced to resign .
when he did step down about a month ago , the umts investment was widely cited as one of his cardinal errors .

today the next generation in cell phones is still in its infancy . two years ago , german telephone companies paid the government a total of some 50 billion euro in license fees for the new mobile connectivity standard umts .
at the time of the purchase , umts was all the rage in mobile phoning .
billed as a technological hyper-revolution for cell phones , the universal mobile telecommunications system allows for data transmission at about 14 times the speed of the current state of the art protocol gprs – and promises to be a stunning 160 times as fast as de facto standard gsm .
there 's only one snag : contrary to earlier announcements , the general public in germany wo n't even see the first umts units until next year .
delayed launch one by one , germany ’ s major telecommunication companies announced they would have to postpone the launch of umts services .
instead of being ready for the market by the start of 2003 as stipulated by the government at the time of purchase , the mobile phone providers have pushed their start days back several months to mid-2003 .
they claim they are not quite ready to introduce the next generation in cell phones .
only vodafone , one of the largest telecoms operating in germany , held steadfastly to the new technology 's capabilities and stubbornly maintained that umts was to become a reality this year .
but on thursday , the ceo of vodafone germany told the daily die welt that the launch was off for the time being .
blaming cell phone producers for the delay , jürgen von kuczkowski said next spring would be the new target date for its umts premiere – now initially restricted to vodafone 's own employees and selected big customers .
kuczowski said phone manufacturers motorola and nokia had not yet delivered satisfactory mobile phones for umts reception , saying they " often ca n't stick to firmly agreed dates and keep postponing the implementation of promised technical features . "
delays are result of poor financial planning but according to the idate institute in france , which monitors developments on the international telecommunications market , the cause for the delay lies elsewhere .
the umts service providers are having a hard time setting up their networks , says carole manero , spokesperson for the institute .
" they 're battling colossal debts and often ca n't afford the investments they 've announced , " she says .
in sweden , for example , the french owned telecom orange has already asked the government whether their umts launch might not be postponed by three years .
" umts is n't a 100 meter sprint , " said kuczkowski .
" a few months are n't an issue . "
but public opinion is another thing .
back in 2000 , an opinion poll by emnid revealed that 71 percent of germans were " probably " or " almost certainly " not going to buy a umts capable phone in the foreseeable future .
umts more expensive than predicted at roughly the same time , cluster consulting was predicting that service operators were going to have to earn about 50 euro per umts customer per month to make their investments in the new network pay off .
in germany , as in the rest of europe , the exorbitant prices paid for the licenses triggered a long downhill slide for telecommunication shares .
between march 2000 and march 2001 , share values for germany 's largest telecommunications provider deutsche telekom dropped by 75 percent , prompting rumors that ceo ron sommer would be forced to resign .
when he did step down about a month ago , the umts investment was widely cited as one of his cardinal errors .
die welt termed the entire project a " giant building site " that would n't yield profits for years to come .

germany 's revered football league turns 40 this year .
but tax corruption and a cash crunch is threatening to tarnish the league 's polished reputation . in its 40th anniversary season , the german football league kicks off on friday with reigning champions borussia dortmund playing host to hertha berlin at dortmund 's westfalen stadium .
but in the midst of the frenzied anticipation across the country , the shadow of sleaze has settled on what is proudly upheld as germany 's showcase of football to the world .
already struggling under a collapse in pay television revenues after the slide into bankruptcy by the kirchmedia empire , germany 's professional football league is watching nervously as prosecutors investigate suspected tax evasion involving payments by top bundesliga club bayer leverkusen .
investigators dig into leverkusen 's tax dealings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's jens nowotny , right , begins the new season under a cloud .
according to the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper , prosecutors were tipped off in march that bayer had paid player jens novotny and former coach christoph daum in cash or through complicated side deals in order to minimise their tax liabilities .
in novotny 's case , prosecutors are reportedly probing an allegation into the transfer fee paid by bayer when the player moved to the club from karlsruhe sc in 1996 .
it was officially listed at around 2 million euro -lrb- $ 1.98 million -rrb- but was in fact closer to 5 million euro -lrb- $ 4.9 million -rrb- .
investigators have discovered that some of the money was paid to novotny through relatives who were in lower tax brackets .
novotny 's former agent , georg bischoff , said the 28-year-old defender had shared in the transfer fee , but that to his knowledge the money was claimed for tax purposes .
former bayer boss accused of illegal cash payments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph daum feels the strain of further allegations .
as for daum , the munich daily said the prosecutor was using a statement contained in a document filed in connection with hamburg lawyer matthias prinz 's lawsuit against daum for alleged non-payment of legal fees .
in the statement , prinz claims that daum told him in the presence of a public relations man that bayer had used foreign banks to make cash payments to him in addition to those required by his contract .
bayer , who went to the champions league final last year , has denied paying novotny any money that was not taxed , but has declined comment on the daum allegations .
the former leverkusen coach denied receiving any undeclared payments .
dieter ondracek , the chairman of the union representing employees of german tax authorities , said he was not surprised by the allegations .
he claimed in the süddeutsche zeitung that " every club in the bundesliga " uses indirect payment methods to reduce players ' taxes .
but werner hackmann , the president of the german football league , which operates the bundesliga , dismissed the charge and called the league " clean . "
money is tight in the world of the soccer millionaires football faces a tough test over the coming months as the game across europe feels the pinch of tight budgeting .
the bundesliga is suffering , with only 100 million -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- available for new players this season - a quarter less than in previous years .
the kirch collapse is the main reason behind this with events concerning the fall of the media empire forcing a 20 per cent reduction in income to clubs from televised games .
bskyb pulls plug on media giant kirch to add to woes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murdoch and kirch : parting company .
just when it looked like things could n't get any worse , recent reports stated that kirch was edging closer to a complete collapse after it emerged that rupert murdoch ’ s bskyb has exercised an option to sell its stake in insolvent kirchpaytv back to the group .
by withdrawing support , bskyb effectively strangles the financial life out of one of kirch 's last reliable cash injections .
kirch 's flagship , german pay tv channel premiere world which carries the bundesliga games , is held by a separate , wholly owned company and remains on-air for the moment , although it only has enough cash to last until the middle of june .
what happens beyond that date is anyone 's guess .
in a country where football is a religion , the removal of the beautiful game from german screens may have a disastrous effect on a nation 's happiness . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kirch files for insolvency with the kirch group ’ s filing for insolvency in a munich court monday , the scramble for the remains of leo kirch ’ s fallen media empire officially began .

kim dae-jung went against the opinion of the opposition party and the people by appointing mr chang acting prime minister grand national party spokesman chang dae-whan , 50 , is the chief executive of the maeil business newspaper .
the announcement came a day after the main opposition grand national party -lrb- gnp -rrb- seized control of the country 's national assembly in a by-election landslide .
the prime minister is a largely ceremonial figure in south korea , but would take over the reins of power if the president was incapacitated .
his appointment must be ratified by the national assembly .
reservations president kim 's initial choice for prime minister - chang sang , the president of a women 's university - was vetoed by parliament last week .
local election results were a blow to the president ms sang would have been the country 's first female prime minister .
but the gnp had accused her of lying over property dealings and her academic background .
the party also expressed strong reservations about the new nominee .
" president kim dae-jung went against the opinion of the opposition party and the people by appointing mr chang acting prime minister , " said gnp spokesman nam kyong-phil .
" as we are not able to form an opinion about the nominee 's suitability for the post at this stage , we will do our best to determine if he is the right man for the job through parliamentary hearings , " he said .
however president kim 's millennium democratic party -lrb- mdp -rrb- welcomed the appointment .
" the new nominee seems to be a man of outstanding ability who has his own views on international affairs and the economy , " mdp spokesman lee nak-yon said .
presidential poll pointer kim dae-jung 's allies did badly in thursday 's by-elections , a bad sign for him ahead of presidential elections at the end of the year .
mr kim is barred from running again by the constitution .
but the pro-government candidate , roh moo-hyun , has been trailing in the polls .
the election results will be a further boost for the gnp 's presidential hopes .
gnp leader lee hoi-chang , who narrowly lost a 1997 election to president kim , is running for president again this year .
gnp candidates from won 11 of the 13 districts being contested , including all three high-profile seats fought in seoul .
those wins give a majority in the single-chamber parliament to the conservative gnp , which is critical of president kim 's " sunshine " engagement policy with north korea .
the independent election commission said the turnout was just 29.7 % - a new national low .
correspondents said many voters were on holiday , put off by the country 's scandal-ridden politics or busy cleaning up after torrential rains which flooded thousands of homes and killed at least five people .

recovery ?
japan 's gross domestic product achieved a promising annual rate of 5.7 % in the january-march quarter , but that number could be revised down .
many economists also expect a contraction in the three months to june .
japan 's economy has been in a slowdown for 10 years , but was pulled out of recession this year by a recovery in exports to asia and the us .
however , fears that the us economy might lurch back into recession could badly knock the vulnerable japanese economy .
recent dives on the tokyo stock market - in spite of gains in the last few days - and a weakening in the dollar have also made the japanese government nervous that the wings of its fledgling recovery could be clipped .
tokyo 's main stock market was up nearly 2 % on friday , following a three-day rally on wall street .

chavez supporters pressed their point police clashed with pro-chavez supporters outside the court following the decision .
at least seven people have been shot and wounded .
the authorities had ordered troops and metropolitan police to ring the court and backed them with armoured vehicles and at least one tank .
nonetheless , supporters of the president , who want to see the officers jailed , burnt tyres and blocked off streets near the courthouse .
the decision is a repeat of a ruling last week that sparked three days of violence .
bitter divide under the supreme court rules , one judge must draft a ruling , and the 20-member court votes to either back it or reject it .
on thursday the draft from a chavez-appointed judge was in favour of sending the four officers to trial for their alleged role in the attempted coup .
nine judges backed it ; the 11 appointed by the president 's rivals voted against it .
the president 's supporters want the officers punished for what they say is nothing less than treason .
the officers still do n't know if they will be tried the case has widened the already bitter political divide between mr chavez 's allies and his foes .
those who back the populist president say he has brought social justice to the vast underclass of poor , while his opponents accuse him of driving a wedge between the classes and of pushing the country towards recession .
the court will have another opportunity to resolve the case of the officers one way or another when it tries again to reach a majority decision next week . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's nick miles reports " few people would bet against further angry protests on the streets " key stories brooding danger strike in pictures oil industry views from venezuela background profile : hugo chavez venezuela timeline country profile talking point your experiences see also : 03 aug 02 -pipe- americas street clashes engulf venezuela 's capital 29 jun 02 -pipe- americas venezuelans fear new clashes 16 jun 02 -pipe- americas protests fuel venezuela fears 09 jun 02 -pipe- americas venezuela coup rumour dismissed 14 may 02 -pipe- americas us investigates venezuela coup role internet links : venezuelan government the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top americas stories now : us draws up second iraq resolution chicago club owners face charges peru 's ex-spy chief on public trial venezuela signs non-violence pact us plays down n korean threat us struggles to clear snow hacker breaches credit card security bolivian cabinet resigns links to more americas stories are at the foot of the page .

the party suffered crushing defeats in a series of by-elections on thursday when its opponents won control of the national assembly .
the mdp , founded by president kim dae-jung just two-and-a-half years ago , has been damaged by a series of corruption scandals surrounding the president 's key aides and two of his three sons .
chang dae-whan is the president 's latest choice for prime minister separately , president kim put forward the head of south korea 's largest business newspaper , chang dae-whan , as his new nominee for prime minister .
his original choice , chang sang , would have been the first woman to hold the largely ceremonial post , but her appointment was vetoed in parliament .
the main opposition grand national party now has overall control of that single-chamber national assembly after thursday 's by-elections wins .
political upheaval the bbc 's correspondent in seoul , caroline gluck , says major changes are now under way in south korea 's political arena .
she says the mdp wants to make a fresh start to regain public confidence .
the move comes ahead of december 's presidential elections to find the successor to mr kim , who may not stand again under constitutional rules .
the gnp candidate , lee hoi-chang , is the current front-runner .
his party expressed strong reservations about the new nominee for prime minister , who assumes the president 's duties if he becomes incapacitated or dies .
confirmation uncertain the national assembly could yet veto the appointment of mr chang , 50 , who is the chief executive of the maeil business newspaper .
a gnp spokesman , nam kyong-phil , said : " president kim dae-jung went against the opinion of the opposition party and the people by appointing mr chang acting prime minister . "
he added : " as we are not able to form an opinion about the nominee 's suitability for the post at this stage , we will do our best to determine if he is the right man for the job through parliamentary hearings " .
the mdp welcomed the new man .
party spokesman lee nak-yon said : " the new nominee seems to be a man of outstanding ability who has his own views on international affairs and the economy . "

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- why ads on the net do n't work news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : technology news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk friday , 9 august , 2002 , 07:55 gmt 08:55 uk why ads on the net do n't work technology consultant bill thompson has had enough of the hard sell on the web but is not optimistic about the alternatives to advertising .
i am fed up with pop-ups , pop-unders , interstitials , expanding banners and the rest of the toolkit used by those who want to sell me stuff while i surf the web .
it seems that every time i click on a web link i get an advert appearing in a small window on top of my current browser .
and every time i close down my computer there are two or three large-format ads that have been left there to tempt me to purchase some useless piece of technology , apply for a credit card i do n't need , or spend some money i do n't have at a gambling site .
i never , ever , click on an advert .
i never have , not since the first ones appeared on the nascent web back in 1996 .
i never will many of my favourite sites are infested with crawling insects , racing cars or flying pigs , all cleverly positioned over the text i 'm trying to read and attempting to get my attention .
sometimes i will be distracted by a strange noise coming from my laptop , only to discover someone 's multimedia advert playing a sound at me repeatedly in a vain attempt to interest me in some financial product or network accelerator .
stop the ads i want to tell all of these advertisers to stop , because it is getting in the way .
i use the net a lot - for work , to find nice hotels in padua , to find out what 's on tv or at the movies and just because i like surfing and being surprised by what i find .
in defence of web ads click here for an alternative view but i never , ever , click on an advert .
i never have , not since the first ones appeared on the nascent web back in 1996 .
i never will .
you would think that with all the profiling , data acquisition and expensive analysis done , the people behind the majority of online ads would have realised that i 'm a lost cause and given up on sending these useless pieces of artwork down the wires to my pc .
but no , they remain eternally optimistic .
click here to tell us what you would like bill to write about next the growth of intrusive advertising highlights the fundamental problem facing today 's internet .
making money the days when a company could plan to run at a serious loss in an attempt to build market share , spending venture capital or living off inflated share prices are long gone , and now every online activity has to aim for profitability .
there is no sign that people are yet willing to pay for the material they read online .
how many web-based subscriptions do you have ?
i do n't have any at all , and i 'm a media junkie .
only the well-funded , often the new media operations of large companies with wide interests , or the tiny niche players will survive so money has to come from other sources .
advertising is the one people know best .
unfortunately it does n't seem to be effective .
there is , at last , some evidence that the main commercial sites are realising that this aggressive advertising does not work .
the women 's online network ivillage has just announced that it will no longer sell pop-ups , and even cash-strapped media giant aol time warner has reduced the number of pop-ups that members are exposed to each hour they are online .
unfortunately online adverts , especially the loud , flashing ones that really get noticed , tend to have a similar effect on readers as requests for money .
visitors simply go elsewhere .
survival of the biggest many other people feel the same way , and business plans based on increasing advertising revenue could well go the same way as those which relied on ' first mover advantage ' and the ' new paradigm ' .
some ads float across the screen this would be a significant problem for the net .
if sites start dropping off the web because there is no money to support them , then the direction of internet evolution could shift significantly .
only the well-funded , often the new media operations of large companies with wide interests , or the tiny niche players will survive .
there will be no room for the net 's equivalent of small and medium sized businesses , the powerhouse of the real economy .
there will be a lot less variety or innovation .
there will be less experimentation , and the risk of stagnation .
so where is the money going to come from ?
perhaps the answer is not to try to make the web more like commercial tv , with intrusive and unavoidable commercials every 15 minutes , but to think more carefully about the ways we engage online .
show me respect i do n't want intrusive adverts , but i do n't mind commercial links .
i do n't want pop-ups , but i do n't object to google 's sponsored results at the top of the screen .
i do n't want the hard sell , but i do n't mind a commercial net .
the solution may be for the web merchants to stop acting so desperate and instead to respect site visitors and try to give them stuff they find useful , rather than irritating .
it may be worth a try , anyway .
for those whose fingers are poised over their keyboards .
i know that i could install ad-blocker software that would get rid of many of these intrusions into my online activity , but i have resisted this temptation so far .
this is partly because i do n't necessarily trust the ad-blockers to do a good job and let through all the stuff i actually want .
mostly i want to know what is really happening out there on the net , and do not think a filtered experience would help me to understand the evolution of our online world .
it is only by experiencing this stuff first-hand that we can hope to understand and perhaps even change it .
is there a technology issue that gets you going ?
tell us what you would like bill to write about in his regular column .
i completely disagree , advertising on the web does work as so many people i know purchase through links and banners on websites , yes pop ups are very annoying but they still attract peoples attention .
stuart oxley , england i work in online marketing and some of your point were very true .
tyson pearcey , uk advertising on the web is still being done in an old fashioned ' blanket advert ' manner .
we are missing the potential for more directed / informative adds , the ideal web add wo n't be an add any more but a piece of related yet interesting information on a product / service etc .
lon barfield , uk pop-ups are annoying sure .
but i 'd rather just click them closed every time rather than start having to pay to use the web services i want .
let their marketing campaigns go nuts on my subconscious .
adam , uk in the same way that we walk down the street and window shop .
the internet should be free to use .
but we should pay for the upkeep of the internet , in the same way that we pay for the street to be built and maintained .
so people should pay their isp to provide the infrastructure of the internet .
stuart stanton-davies , uk its politically incorrect to say that net advertising has no future , otherwise name like msn , loot , ebay would n't have survived or bloomed as they have in the recent past .
at the same time , i do n't agree with advertising ideas through junk mailing , junk mails caused users go against the advertised organisation , due to the huge hurdle they cause while looking for important info on net .
m siddiqui , uk if a company decides to have a web presence then it must itself have something to sell , either a product or simply just itself , the website is a self advertisement .
amazon sells books , lastminute sells holidays , they are making money from the net .
as an illustrator i 'm more concerned about what 's happening in the editorial sector .
will subscribers to a paper magazine really start paying for an online version and how can the company shift its huge advertising portfolio onto a website ?
looking ahead or rather dreaming ahead i can see the likes of the economist developing into a web-based media company almost like a tv / film / radio station on the net .
like other traditional media companies perhaps they 'll end up having commercial breaks !
control of how the website is seen by the end-user will increasingly be in the hands of the site owners not the consumers .
steve , uk internet ads are the electronic equivalent of junk mail .
at least trees do n't have to be cut down to send me an internet ad .
but no , i do n't read them .
i just click them off just as i throw all junk mail in the bin .
colin , uk i am in total agreement .
i simply click adds off as soon as they appear .
advertisers need to think clearly because word of mouth is still the best form of advertising .
the irritating use of adverts on the web is probably one of the quickest ways of annoying potential customers .
also , if someone wants me to pay for information , i will look elsewhere to find it for free .
i would only ever pay for a service that i really really needed and could not get anywhere else .
which after eight years of using the web , has never happened .
ben , uk it seems to me that the majority of ads are for unknown and untrusted firms or products .
there is no feeling of security in clicking on them .
i do n't trust them at all .
the established firms do not tend to advertise in this manner .
paul , dublin , ireland yes it can be annoying .
but if 10 million people surf a site that has a pop-up advert , and 20 % click on it and then 10 % actually purchase the product , then i 'm sure that out weighs their costs for the adverts .
got to look at it from both sides .
one thing i will say though is sites trying to invoke auto-installs on your pc that create pop-ups as soon as you go online , those should be stopped .
ross , glasgow i disagree with you in only one area , which is that of pop-under adverts .
whilst none have interested me so far i look longer at them because i am at a natural break in my concentration -lrb- closing the browser for example -rrb- .
they 've not caused me any real inconvenience either so i do n't apply negative thoughts to them or their products and services .
given the fact i never pay for content , pop-under advertising seems a decent alternative .
i just wish they 'd advertise something i find interesting ..
andy , uk i do n't mind a pop-up ad say the first time you visit a website each day for example .
however the ones that pop up at every change of page on a site drive me insane .
there is one property website i stopped using because every click on a search button or on a property 's details elicited a pop up for their sister website .

i am fed up with pop-ups , pop-unders , interstitials , expanding banners and the rest of the toolkit used by those who want to sell me stuff while i surf the web .
it seems that every time i click on a web link i get an advert appearing in a small window on top of my current browser .
and every time i close down my computer there are two or three large-format ads that have been left there to tempt me to purchase some useless piece of technology , apply for a credit card i do n't need , or spend some money i do n't have at a gambling site . "
i never , ever , click on an advert .
i never have , not since the first ones appeared on the nascent web back in 1996 .
i never will " many of my favourite sites are infested with crawling insects , racing cars or flying pigs , all cleverly positioned over the text i 'm trying to read and attempting to get my attention .
sometimes i will be distracted by a strange noise coming from my laptop , only to discover someone 's multimedia advert playing a sound at me repeatedly in a vain attempt to interest me in some financial product or network accelerator .
stop the ads i want to tell all of these advertisers to stop , because it is getting in the way .
i use the net a lot - for work , to find nice hotels in padua , to find out what 's on tv or at the movies and just because i like surfing and being surprised by what i find .
but i never , ever , click on an advert .
i never have , not since the first ones appeared on the nascent web back in 1996 .
i never will .
you would think that with all the profiling , data acquisition and expensive analysis done , the people behind the majority of online ads would have realised that i 'm a lost cause and given up on sending these useless pieces of artwork down the wires to my pc .
but no , they remain eternally optimistic .
the growth of intrusive advertising highlights the fundamental problem facing today 's internet .
making money the days when a company could plan to run at a serious loss in an attempt to build market share , spending venture capital or living off inflated share prices are long gone , and now every online activity has to aim for profitability .
there is no sign that people are yet willing to pay for the material they read online .
how many web-based subscriptions do you have ?
i do n't have any at all , and i 'm a media junkie . "
only the well-funded , often the new media operations of large companies with wide interests , or the tiny niche players will survive " so money has to come from other sources .
advertising is the one people know best .
unfortunately it does n't seem to be effective .
there is , at last , some evidence that the main commercial sites are realising that this aggressive advertising does not work .
the women 's online network ivillage has just announced that it will no longer sell pop-ups , and even cash-strapped media giant aol time warner has reduced the number of pop-ups that members are exposed to each hour they are online .
unfortunately online adverts , especially the loud , flashing ones that really get noticed , tend to have a similar effect on readers as requests for money .
visitors simply go elsewhere .
survival of the biggest many other people feel the same way , and business plans based on increasing advertising revenue could well go the same way as those which relied on ' first mover advantage ' and the ' new paradigm ' .
this would be a significant problem for the net .
if sites start dropping off the web because there is no money to support them , then the direction of internet evolution could shift significantly .
only the well-funded , often the new media operations of large companies with wide interests , or the tiny niche players will survive .
there will be no room for the net 's equivalent of small and medium sized businesses , the powerhouse of the real economy .
there will be a lot less variety or innovation .
there will be less experimentation , and the risk of stagnation .
so where is the money going to come from ?
perhaps the answer is not to try to make the web more like commercial tv , with intrusive and unavoidable commercials every 15 minutes , but to think more carefully about the ways we engage online .
show me respect i do n't want intrusive adverts , but i do n't mind commercial links .
i do n't want pop-ups , but i do n't object to google 's sponsored results at the top of the screen .
i do n't want the hard sell , but i do n't mind a commercial net .
the solution may be for the web merchants to stop acting so desperate and instead to respect site visitors and try to give them stuff they find useful , rather than irritating .
it may be worth a try , anyway .
for those whose fingers are poised over their keyboards .
i know that i could install ad-blocker software that would get rid of many of these intrusions into my online activity , but i have resisted this temptation so far .
this is partly because i do n't necessarily trust the ad-blockers to do a good job and let through all the stuff i actually want .
mostly i want to know what is really happening out there on the net , and do not think a filtered experience would help me to understand the evolution of our online world .
it is only by experiencing this stuff first-hand that we can hope to understand and perhaps even change it .
is there a technology issue that gets you going ?
tell us what you would like bill to write about in his regular column .
i completely disagree , advertising on the web does work as so many people i know purchase through links and banners on websites , yes pop ups are very annoying but they still attract peoples attention .
stuart oxley , england i work in online marketing and some of your point were very true .
tyson pearcey , uk advertising on the web is still being done in an old fashioned ' blanket advert ' manner .
we are missing the potential for more directed / informative adds , the ideal web add wo n't be an add any more but a piece of related yet interesting information on a product / service etc .
lon barfield , uk pop-ups are annoying sure .
but i 'd rather just click them closed every time rather than start having to pay to use the web services i want .
let their marketing campaigns go nuts on my subconscious .
adam , uk in the same way that we walk down the street and window shop .
the internet should be free to use .
but we should pay for the upkeep of the internet , in the same way that we pay for the street to be built and maintained .
so people should pay their isp to provide the infrastructure of the internet .
stuart stanton-davies , uk its politically incorrect to say that net advertising has no future , otherwise name like msn , loot , ebay would n't have survived or bloomed as they have in the recent past .
at the same time , i do n't agree with advertising ideas through junk mailing , junk mails caused users go against the advertised organisation , due to the huge hurdle they cause while looking for important info on net .
m siddiqui , uk if a company decides to have a web presence then it must itself have something to sell , either a product or simply just itself , the website is a self advertisement .
amazon sells books , lastminute sells holidays , they are making money from the net .
as an illustrator i 'm more concerned about what 's happening in the editorial sector .
will subscribers to a paper magazine really start paying for an online version and how can the company shift its huge advertising portfolio onto a website ?
looking ahead or rather dreaming ahead i can see the likes of the economist developing into a web-based media company almost like a tv / film / radio station on the net .
like other traditional media companies perhaps they 'll end up having commercial breaks !
control of how the website is seen by the end-user will increasingly be in the hands of the site owners not the consumers .
steve , uk internet ads are the electronic equivalent of junk mail .
at least trees do n't have to be cut down to send me an internet ad .
but no , i do n't read them .
i just click them off just as i throw all junk mail in the bin .
colin , uk i am in total agreement .
i simply click adds off as soon as they appear .
advertisers need to think clearly because word of mouth is still the best form of advertising .
the irritating use of adverts on the web is probably one of the quickest ways of annoying potential customers .
also , if someone wants me to pay for information , i will look elsewhere to find it for free .
i would only ever pay for a service that i really really needed and could not get anywhere else .
which after eight years of using the web , has never happened .
ben , uk it seems to me that the majority of ads are for unknown and untrusted firms or products .
there is no feeling of security in clicking on them .
i do n't trust them at all .
the established firms do not tend to advertise in this manner .
paul , dublin , ireland yes it can be annoying .
but if 10 million people surf a site that has a pop-up advert , and 20 % click on it and then 10 % actually purchase the product , then i 'm sure that out weighs their costs for the adverts .
got to look at it from both sides .
one thing i will say though is sites trying to invoke auto-installs on your pc that create pop-ups as soon as you go online , those should be stopped .
ross , glasgow i disagree with you in only one area , which is that of pop-under adverts .
whilst none have interested me so far i look longer at them because i am at a natural break in my concentration -lrb- closing the browser for example -rrb- .
they 've not caused me any real inconvenience either so i do n't apply negative thoughts to them or their products and services .
given the fact i never pay for content , pop-under advertising seems a decent alternative .
i just wish they 'd advertise something i find interesting ..
andy , uk i do n't mind a pop-up ad say the first time you visit a website each day for example .
however the ones that pop up at every change of page on a site drive me insane .
there is one property website i stopped using because every click on a search button or on a property 's details elicited a pop up for their sister website .

an examination of computers taken from the girls ' homes has resulted in a " number of lines of inquiry " , according to detectives .
these fresh leads come as police admit clues emerging from cctv pictures of the pair have " run dry " .
police fear the pair might have been lured away by someone they met via the internet .
and they have been advised by specialists who profile offenders there is a " reasonable possibility " holly and jessica are alive with an abductor , five days after they disappeared near their homes in soham , cambridgeshire .
detective superintendent david hankins , heading the inquiry , told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " specialists , including offender profilers , have advised us that the circumstances we face here in cambridgeshire suggest a reasonable possibility they are still with someone who has abducted them " and there is a strong possibility they are still alive and well . "
on thursday , another senior officer , det supt david beck , urged anyone holding them to contact a solicitor .
he said two computers - one taken from each of the girls ' homes - were being checked by experts .
" there are a number of lines of inquiry arising out of that , " he added .
police said the computer at holly 's home , where the girls had spent much of sunday , was in use for nearly 30 minutes a little over an hour before the youngsters disappeared .
it has also emerged parents in the area were warned about strangers , just weeks before holly and jessica disappeared .
the warning came after a man and a woman approached a child at a playgroup next door to the girls ' school .
detectives are also checking call records for jessica 's mobile phone , which she had with her and which has not been found .
but he insisted they had no direct evidence to indicate holly and jessica were being held against their will .
police have released cctv pictures of the girls as they walked through a sports centre car park on sunday at about 1820 bst .
four potential witnesses seen in the footage were traced by police , but detectives said they had offered no further lines of inquiry .
det supt hankins told bbc breakfast : " the trail is running dry . "
police have received more than 3,000 calls but most " sightings " are being eliminated .
he said it was " almost impossible to believe " the youngsters had suffered some sort of accident .
express newspapers has offered a £ 1m reward for information , and businessmen and other newspapers have offered rewards totalling more than £ 200,000 .
about 250 officers from five different police forces are searching the soham area for any clues .
tests are being carried out on a white van seized from a caravan park in wentworth , about 10 miles away from soham , after reports a vehicle was cruising the area on sunday .
both girls , who were wearing manchester united shirts , are white , about 4ft 6in tall and slim .
jessica is tanned and has shoulder-length brown hair while holly is fair and has blonde hair .
anyone with information should call police on 01480 422982 .

hopes of finding any survivors had faded when high temperatures , thick smoke and carbon monoxide forced rescuers to turn back after starting down a 60-metre -lrb- 200-ft -rrb- vertical rescue shaft , china 's official xinhua news agency said .
initial investigations showed that the mine had no adequate safety systems and its owner , in order to evade safety checks , had ordered the miners to work secretly at night xinhua news agency the miner was taken to hospital in a critical condition from the chiyu mine in huozhou , reports said .
bodies were recovered of the other 18 miners , who were believed to have died of suffocation and carbon monoxide poisoning , xinhua said .
further south , in hunan province , officials said many miners were trapped underground when floods and landslides struck , leading to fears of more deaths .
correspondents say that china 's mine industry is one of the world 's deadliest as well as being one of the largest .
state radio reported that 143 people were killed in coal mine accidents in july alone , and official media said 7,000 died last year .
police in shanxi have arrested eight people , including the mine 's manager , after the latest incident .
fire still burning the effects of the fire , believed to have been started by an electrical cable in the main shaft , were compounded by other problems , xinhua said .
" initial investigations showed that the mine had no adequate safety systems and its owner , in order to evade safety checks , had ordered the miners to work secretly at night , " it said .
fire continues to burn in the coal mine , which has now been sealed off .
the state has recently ordered unsafe mines to close , but this is not in the interests of the local authorities , who rely on the mines ' revenue .
analysts say that the government 's pledge to jail the officials responsible for poor safety may actually lead to more accidents going unreported .
more than 12,000 mines have closed because of safety concerns since last may .

tayside nhs board said it was " virtually certain " that the outbreak originated at the perth leisure pool last month .
the pool has been closed as a precaution while tests are carried out .
we are now virtually certain that the outbreak originated in perth leisure pool dr julie cavanagh eight cases have already been confirmed among young children .
the health board said on thursday that the number of suspected cases amongst friends and relatives of those children had now grown to seven .
dr julie cavanagh , the head of the outbreak control team , said there was no cause for alarm as cryptosporidiosis was usually a " very mild illness " .
it is caused by the cryptosporidium parasite , which sparked an alert in glasgow and clydebank following concerns about the levels in the water supply .
more than 150,000 people served by one reservoir were told to boil their water between saturday night and wednesday afternoon .

tayside nhs board said it was " virtually certain " that the outbreak originated at the perth leisure pool last month .
the pool has been closed as a precaution while tests are carried out . "
we are now virtually certain that the outbreak originated in perth leisure pool " dr julie cavanagh eight cases have already been confirmed among young children .
the health board said on thursday that the number of suspected cases amongst friends and relatives of those children had now grown to seven .
dr julie cavanagh , the head of the outbreak control team , said there was no cause for alarm as cryptosporidiosis was usually a " very mild illness " .
it is caused by the cryptosporidium parasite , which sparked an alert in glasgow and clydebank following concerns about the levels in the water supply .
more than 150,000 people served by one reservoir were told to boil their water between saturday night and wednesday afternoon .
accidental contamination cryptosporidium can cause severe diarrhoea , sickness , stomach cramps and a slight fever .

the landmark decision is a blow to aboriginal claims of ancestral rights and should also determine hundreds of other unsettled cases .
nice little black fella , you can go hunting but you do n't have any control over who goes on the land wayne bergmann , aboriginal leader the court says aborigines still have limited rights to hunt on the land and visit what they consider to be sacred tribal sites .
the decision has been described by aboriginal elders as " offensive and discriminatory " .
rights ' extinguished ' the ruling was made on a 1994 claim by the miriuwung-gajerrong tribe to land covering 7,900 square kilometres -lrb- 3,050 square miles -rrb- in north-western australia .
the tribe says the land belonged to them , long before european settlers arrived more than 200 years ago .
the area includes the argyle diamond mine , the largest in australia .
in delivering his decision at the high court in canberra , chief justice murray gleeson said : " all native title rights and interest in respect of the land within that reserve had been extinguished before the argyle mining lease was granted . "
the mine is currently owned by the rio tinto firm in melbourne , which said it was studying the 406-page ruling .
aborigine anger aboriginal leaders have criticised the decision and urged the australian government and the mine owners to discuss better ways of sharing the land .
wayne bergmann , a senior aboriginal leader from the disputed area , said the court was saying to aborigines : " nice little black fella , you can go hunting but you do n't have any control over who goes on the land . "
hundreds of native title claims have been submitted by aboriginal groups since 1992 , following a ruling which scrapped the notion that australia was uninhabited before europeans arrived in 1788 .
aborigines , who number about 400,000 among 19 million australians , are among the poorest sections of society and claim discrimination is widespread against them . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's dominic hughes " lawyers have been debating how far aboriginal land rights extend " see also : 04 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific australia 's new ' black pride ' 23 aug 01 -pipe- asia-pacific australian territory signals aboriginal reconciliation 04 jan 01 -pipe- asia-pacific aborigine treaty plans dismissed 21 jul 00 -pipe- asia-pacific australia attacked over aborigine treatment 02 sep 00 -pipe- asia-pacific un puts more pressure on australia internet links : australian federal government council for aboriginal reconciliation australian human rights and equal opportunity commission atsic homepage the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top asia-pacific stories now : s korea subway inferno toll rises us plays down n korean threat thai pm says officials peddling drugs australia refuses to lift bali warning chinese official vows to end corruption japanese emperor back to work leatherbacks ' extinct in 30 years ' new project to demine tajikistan links to more asia-pacific stories are at the foot of the page .
