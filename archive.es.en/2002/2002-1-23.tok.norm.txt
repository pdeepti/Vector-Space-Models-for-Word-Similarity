sales during the october to december period rose by one third to 466m euros -lrb- $ 412m , £ 287m -rrb- , bringing turnover for the whole of 2001 to 1.56bn euros .
wanadoo clearly demonstrated that the internet is indeed a reality nicolas dufourcq wanadoo chief executive the company said it expected to post a profit before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization this year .
the number of subscribers to the firm 's services increased by 150 % to six million last year , and wanadoo said it was aiming to have 10 million clients by the end of 2003 .
the figures , which came the same day that the e-tailer amazon revealed it had broken into profit , represent a boost for an industry still struggling to convince investors of its growth potential .
" in a year that saw markets question the future of the internet , wanadoo clearly demonstrated that the internet is indeed a reality , " chairman and chief executive nicolas dufourcq said .
online directories wanadoo draws revenues from internet access charges , e-commerce and directory services .
the market will be especially pleased about an increase in freeserve 's customers , reflecting its renewed focus on customer growth dresdner kleinwort wasserstein commercial telephone directory , les pages jeunes , owned by wanadoo provides access to directory information in 23 countries .
last year the services responded to more than 75 million requests and generated revenues of approximately 15 million euros .
overall directories and business services of the company account for nearly one-third of all the advertisers on the internet .
customer growth wanadoo has subscribers in france , where its share of the market is more than 60 % , in the uk , the netherlands , belgium and spain .
doubling the freeserve network capacity created a solid platform on which to go out after the summer and win new customers once again john pluthero freeserve boss in britain , the company 's subsidiary freeserve announced that it has strengthened its position as the uk 's market leading isp with renewed momentum in subscriber growth .
the number of registered accounts increased by 13 % on a like-for-like basis to 2.3 million over the year to 31 december .
" doubling the freeserve network capacity in the first half of 2001 created a solid platform on which to go out after the summer and win new customers once again , " said freeserve 's chief executive john pluthero .
analysts at dresdner kleinwort wasserstein said : " the market will be especially pleased about an increase in freeserve 's customers , reflecting freeserve 's renewed focus on customer growth . "
expansion plans wanadoo has plans to expand its activity in europe further , but only in the countries it already operates , mr dufourcq said .
the subscribers it has are also increasingly moving away to packages offering faster internet access and away from the free basic service , the company said .
wanadoo had 545,000 broadband subscribers in europe at the end of december , compared with 143,000 subscribers a year earlier .
revenue as online advertising has fallen short of expectations , the entire industry has been scrambling for alternative revenue sources .
analysts have predicted that isps that can not get their customers to pay for content and services will not survive .
europe 's largest isp , german t-online , began charging for high-quality and broadband content this year in a move to reduce its dependence on low-margin fees for internet access .
in december , europe 's anti-trust regulator opened an investigation into wanadoo 's prices , looking into whether the company undercuts competitors by charging less than it costs to provide the services .

aol said that microsoft used its market dominance to undermine aol 's netscape internet browser , which was once common on desktops until microsoft began giving its own browser away for free .
this action is an attempt to get justice aol chief john buckley the lawsuit is based on court findings that microsoft used its domination of the market in operating systems to restrict competition .
analysts said aol 's legal bill might run into tens of millions of dollars , and might reach $ 100m , if it chose to pursue the case to the end through the courts .
last november , microsoft reached an out-of-court settlement with the us justice department and nine states in a long-running antitrust case .
nine other states that were part of the action refused to accept the settlement , holding out for tougher penalties .
immediate injunction " this action is an attempt to get justice , " aol chief executive john buckley said .
aol time warner said its netscape navigator browser suffered harm through microsoft 's unfair promotion of its own browser , internet explorer .
netscape 's share of the internet browser market has declined sharply since the mid-1990s .
we 've consistently tried to work more closely with -lsb- netscape -rsb- , and they 've consistently turned us down jim desler , microsoft the firm asked the court for damages and to impose an immediate injunction against microsoft to prevent " ongoing and further damage " to its product .
" netscape 's lawsuit is a logical extension of the findings ... that microsoft thwarted competition , violated the antitrust laws and illegally preserved its monopoly at netscape 's expense , " aol lawyer randall boe said .
microsoft spokesman jim desler said the lawsuit was a " disappointment " .
" microsoft is disappointed that aol has chosen litigation , " he said .
" we 've consistently tried to work more closely with them , and they 've consistently turned us down . "
netscape , which was bought by aol time warner in 1999 , filed the suit in the us district court in washington dc .
precedent last summer , a panel of seven appeal judges upheld the finding of eight separate antitrust violations by microsoft .
the appeals court said microsoft 's actions had " helped keep usage of navigator below the critical level " for any successful challenge to internet explorer 's market dominance .
however the original remedies , which included splitting the company , were rejected .
the court criticised the judge in the original trial , appointed a fresh judge and recommended new remedies be found .
penalties the settlement agreed in november fell far short of the original penalties but imposed a panel of monitors on microsoft .
microsoft agreed to release technical specifications which would enable other software developers to build programmes that could interact with its operating system .
that deal , agreed last november , was praised by attorney general john ashcroft as bringing a fair end to the three year case .
some commentators viewed the november breakthrough as reflecting the desire of president george w bush 's administration , on the verge of war in afghanistan , to shed burdensome distractions .

two women , who were among the more than 20 people injured in tuesday 's attack , have now died of their wounds in hospital and two other people are said to be in a serious condition .
there 's no justification for these kinds of attack richard boucher state department spokesman the al-aqsa martyrs ' brigade , a group linked to mr arafat 's fatah faction , said the gunman , who opened fire with an automatic weapon in west jerusalem , belonged to its organisation .
a state department spokesman in washington said the us was once again calling on mr arafat to take immediate and effective steps to end the attacks and bring those responsible to justice .
" there 's no justification for these kinds of attacks .
they only kill innocent people , " spokesman richard boucher said .
the shooting happened in jaffa street , near a popular shopping mall which was the scene of a suicide bombing in december 2001 .
police say the gunman fired on people at a bus stop and other passers-by for about 10 minutes before being shot dead .
the streets of the city were crowded with people returning home from work .
jerusalem police chief mickey levy said : " the terrorist tried to run away , but after a short chase , police succeeded in hitting him and killed him . "
the israeli government has blamed the palestinian authority for the attack .
" we hold responsible the terrorist organisations islamic jihad , hamas and the tanzim , which commit in turns these atrocities , and the palestinian authority which does nothing to stop them , " said spokesman avi pazner .
the latest attack was " a continuation of the terrorist campaign against israeli civilians , women and children , committed by terrorist organisations with the passive or active encouragement of the palestinian authority " , he added .
the shooting occurred shortly after the militant islamic group hamas declared that it would be waging all-out war on israel .
the group issued its statement following an incursion by israeli forces into the palestinian-run west bank city of nablus , in which four hamas members were killed .
" this massacre opens the door wide open for a fierce war , which will reach the zionist gangs everywhere , and with all means , " it said .
after the israeli raid on nablus , thousands of demonstrators surrounded a palestinian police station in the town and forced the release of a militant - the brother of one of those killed in the raid .
at one point , palestinian police opened fire on the crowd .

under the slogan " uk ok , " the industry hopes to recover at least half the £ 2bn it lost last year due to a slump in visitor numbers .
over a thousand hotels , attractions and other tourism businesses are offering hefty discounts , backed up by a £ 5m advertising campaign .
coordinated by the british tourism authority , the promitional drive is aimed at the uk 's main overseas markets - the us , canada , france , germany , ireland , belgium and the netherlands .
competitive edge organisers are also hoping that the commonwealth games and the queen 's golden jubilee celebrations will attract more visitors .
-lrb- the campaign -rrb- will give us a much-needed edge over all those destinations competing for bookings for this year 's holiday season , " said uk culture secretary tessa jowell .
official statistics show that overseas visitor numbers fell by 30 % on the year in october , reflecting the impact of the 11 september attacks .
arrivals for holiday visits had already fallen steeply during the key summer season due to the foot and mouth outbreak .
the drop in tourist numbers triggered a wave of bankruptcies among uk tourism businesses , who depend heavily on high-spending overseas visitors .

the judges : waterman , fox , chapman and cowell pop idol was the tv show aiming to propel a singer from obscurity to superstardom , whittling 10,000 hopefuls down to just one .
bbc news online 's helen bushby looks at the show which hooked more than 10 million viewers .
pop idol first hit our screens back in october , providing an irresistible mixture of voyeurism and hilarity .
thousands of wannabe singers lined up to audition - but the majority of them did not have even the remotest makings of a pop idol , as the judges were quick to tell them .
presenters ant and dec were so overcome with laughter that they were ordered out of the audition room .
but that did not stop them peeking through the keyhole .
viewers were hooked .
as well as becoming armchair judges , they were able to watch the nail-biting ordeal in all its glory , as more and more singers were sent home and told to abandon their dreams .
producer pete waterman , record executive simon cowell , dj neil fox and nicki chapman , who also decided the fate of the popstars , did not hide how they felt .
from cowell 's caustic comments to waterman being moved to tears by finalist rosie ribbons , the judges have become almost more memorable than the singers .
but that is not to say that all the contestants have been bland - far from it .
rik waller , whose considerable weight caused concern among the judges , pulled out from the finals at the last minute due to throat problems .
he was replaced by darius danesh , a popstars reject - popstars was the tv show which saw the chart-topping band hear 'say put together in a similar fashion by a panel of judges .
darius was famous for his much-ridiculed version of britney spears ' hit me baby one more time - aped to perfection by ant and dec .
the last 10 finalists performed every saturday night in a particular pop style - from abba to burt bacharach .
and each week one was voted off by the public .
the last edition of the show pulled in more than 10 million viewers , with bbc one 's generation game lagging behind in the ratings .
but it is not just the judges and the hapless finalists who lure in viewers .
ant and dec , who already have a solid fanbase , have sided firmly with the finalists and often ridicule the judges , taking umbrage at their tough comments .
the tabloids , who have followed the show since it began , pushed gareth gates as the one to win , championing his efforts to overcome his stammer .
but gareth and his co-finalists were not the only ones to have hit headlines .
cowell has been photographed on a beach on holiday , while various women have come forward with kiss-and-tell tales about him .
but the head of a & r at record company rca remained unabashed .
he recently told the guardian he " could n't care less " about being too tough on the singers .
" if it makes the show a better programme because there 's more harshness than normal , fantastic , " he said .
he added : " as long as it means people are watching the programme and the winner actually means something , which is quite rare for a talent show like this . "
it has all been good publicity for the show and its winner , who needs as much as he can get .
but so far , at least , winner gareth gates , signed up to cowell 's record company , is living up to his reputation as an idol in the fickle world of pop .

email : lloyds10 @ cardiff.ac.uk tel : 029 20 87 6412 below is a copy of an article dr peter williams has written on the theme of his talk .
regenerating our communities ; are community mutuals the answer ?
regeneration has been on the welsh agenda for decades .
there are many communities where successive central and local government driven regeneration programmes have been underway since the 1940s and where we are still ' regenerating ' .
this suggests how much there is to do , how complex the process is and how the ' target ' keeps moving .
there have been both successes and failures .
frustratingly given the number of years regeneration has been on the agenda we can still identify weaknesses in terms of the way initiatives have been developed .
housing stock we seem to have been poor at learning lessons and we still have a number of problems including ; -lrb- a -rrb- failing to achieve effective co-ordination between programmes and organisations -lrb- b -rrb- the dominance of the ' top down ' approach -lrb- c -rrb- the lack of partnership between agencies and local communities -lrb- d -rrb- the dominance of public sector investment and limited private sector investment new resources local authority housing stock transfer provides an opportunity here .
stock transfer has been opposed by unions , some local authorities and some tenants , at times for questionable motives .
while there are aspects of transfer which can be improved the fact is over 100 local authorities in england have done it , levering new resources to improve homes and bringing identifiable and valued benefits to tenants as a whole .
the community mutual housing association model seeks to address one perceived weakness in stock transfer .
this is the accountability of the new association to the local community .
mutual model creating a mutually member owned association may address this and the hope is that with the development of the community mutual option there may be more appetite for stock transfer in wales .
in my view , some of the perceived weaknesses of existing stock transfer associations could be addressed without creating a mutual model .
moreover , the mutual model does pose some risks regarding ensuring a board with the right skills and with long term stability and the demands it may pose in terms of the priorities for the association , i.e. , is it community empowerment or housing improvement ?
can it be both ?
but there is also the question of the wider regeneration agenda .
for me a key weakness of some stock transfer organisations has been their focus once they are up and running and have delivered most or all of what they have promised to tenants .
challenging agenda as the organisations mature and become financially stronger they have choices about future strategy and this has led to geographical expansion and diversification .
i would like to see a much stronger focus on local regeneration as well as community development .
given the history of regeneration in wales and the move towards stock transfer this is an opportunity which can not be missed .
i believe that alongside stock improvement , area regeneration must be a key priority .
in structuring the mutual this aspect must be taken on board and a vehicle must be created to make best use of the assets being transferred , maximising the potential to lever in other public and private funds .
this is a challenging agenda which will make demands on members , the board and staff and the agencies they work with .
other views there is a danger of trying to do too much , too quickly and this must be borne in mind .
ambition must be viewed alongside risks , rewards , competencies and responsibilities .
can this be delivered ?
do we have the right skills and structures ?
can naw facilitate such a development ?
what can the universities do to help ?
there are many questions to consider .
going forward , better housing and regenerated areas can make a considerable contribution to the regeneration of wales as a whole and the securing of its competitive future in a global economy .
community mutuals are not the answer but part of the answer .
we need to be clear what they can do and what else needs to be done ?
i have set out some of my personal views .
i will air these and more in the lecture .
i would welcome hearing other views and being part of a wider debate .
but we can not talk for too long .
action is needed !

regenerating our communities ; are community mutuals the answer ?
regeneration has been on the welsh agenda for decades .
there are many communities where successive central and local government driven regeneration programmes have been underway since the 1940s and where we are still ' regenerating ' .
this suggests how much there is to do , how complex the process is and how the ' target ' keeps moving .
there have been both successes and failures .
frustratingly given the number of years regeneration has been on the agenda we can still identify weaknesses in terms of the way initiatives have been developed .
housing stock we seem to have been poor at learning lessons and we still have a number of problems including ; -lrb- a -rrb- failing to achieve effective co-ordination between programmes and organisations -lrb- b -rrb- the dominance of the ' top down ' approach -lrb- c -rrb- the lack of partnership between agencies and local communities -lrb- d -rrb- the dominance of public sector investment and limited private sector investment new resources local authority housing stock transfer provides an opportunity here .
stock transfer has been opposed by unions , some local authorities and some tenants , at times for questionable motives .
while there are aspects of transfer which can be improved the fact is over 100 local authorities in england have done it , levering new resources to improve homes and bringing identifiable and valued benefits to tenants as a whole .
the community mutual housing association model seeks to address one perceived weakness in stock transfer .
this is the accountability of the new association to the local community .
mutual model creating a mutually member owned association may address this and the hope is that with the development of the community mutual option there may be more appetite for stock transfer in wales .
in my view , some of the perceived weaknesses of existing stock transfer associations could be addressed without creating a mutual model .
moreover , the mutual model does pose some risks regarding ensuring a board with the right skills and with long term stability and the demands it may pose in terms of the priorities for the association , i.e. , is it community empowerment or housing improvement ?
can it be both ?
but there is also the question of the wider regeneration agenda .
for me a key weakness of some stock transfer organisations has been their focus once they are up and running and have delivered most or all of what they have promised to tenants .
challenging agenda as the organisations mature and become financially stronger they have choices about future strategy and this has led to geographical expansion and diversification .
i would like to see a much stronger focus on local regeneration as well as community development .
given the history of regeneration in wales and the move towards stock transfer this is an opportunity which can not be missed .
i believe that alongside stock improvement , area regeneration must be a key priority .
in structuring the mutual this aspect must be taken on board and a vehicle must be created to make best use of the assets being transferred , maximising the potential to lever in other public and private funds .
this is a challenging agenda which will make demands on members , the board and staff and the agencies they work with .
other views there is a danger of trying to do too much , too quickly and this must be borne in mind .
ambition must be viewed alongside risks , rewards , competencies and responsibilities .
can this be delivered ?
do we have the right skills and structures ?
can naw facilitate such a development ?
what can the universities do to help ?
there are many questions to consider .
going forward , better housing and regenerated areas can make a considerable contribution to the regeneration of wales as a whole and the securing of its competitive future in a global economy .
community mutuals are not the answer but part of the answer .
we need to be clear what they can do and what else needs to be done ?
i have set out some of my personal views .
i will air these and more in the lecture .
i would welcome hearing other views and being part of a wider debate .
but we can not talk for too long .
action is needed !

the northern alliance " came within an ace " of opening fire on british troops as they were flown into bagram airport , according to tony blair 's special representative in afghanistan .

but permission was not sought beforehand from northern alliance commanders guarding the base , former diplomat paul bergne told mps .
giving evidence to the commons foreign affairs select committee , mr bergne said he has never had a satisfactory explanation for the breakdown in communication which potentially put british troops at risk .
' messy situation ' the ministry of defence said it could not confirm mr bergne 's statement , but a spokesman said : " as far as we are concerned all the negotiations and discussions had taken place . "
the prime minister 's official spokesman also refused to confirm the account .
but he added : " we have never denied this was an extremely tricky , messy , difficult situation .
" we have never pretended everything was for the best in the best of all possible worlds - military conflict is not like that . "
but later defence minister lord bach said that the government had informed the northern alliance who was " going in " to bagram .
" that 's exactly what we did .
the confusion that there was was sorted out before fvery long and the fact is that we settled down there very quickly afterwards and everything has been fine since - the royal marines and northern alliance troops get on famously . "
but shadow defence secretary bernard jenkin said he would be demanding an " immediate explanation " from the government .
he told bbc news : " the government should make a statement to parliament to clear this up and if the prime minister can not clear it up one can only conclude that the prime minister 's ambition to put britain on the world stage got miles head of the safety of british troops . "

" when i got to bagram airport about five days later i understood from the british co -lrb- commanding officer -rrb- that he had had discussions with the afghan commander of bagram airfield , who said that they had come within an ace of opening fire . "
asked if he had a satisfactory explanation as to why the british had failed to communicate adequately with the afghan administration , mr bergne replied : " no . "
peace-keeping force mr bergne , a former diplomat who was appointed as mr blair 's special envoy in the region last year , told the committee an international peace-keeping force would be welcomed more in some parts of afghanistan than others .
" on the streets in kabul people are very positive to that .
i think they are fed up with the depredations of warlords and militias and unofficial armed groups .
" i think it will get more difficult outside kabul .

luhrmann said the nomination was " by far the most meaningful " recognition he has received so far .
" directors truly know what directing is , that it 's not just moving traffic around , " ' he said .
scott said his nomination was " a great surprise " .
" it was a lot of tricky work , " he said of the production , adding : " the conventions of the three-act drama could n't really be applied . "
the dga winner will be announced on 9 march .
