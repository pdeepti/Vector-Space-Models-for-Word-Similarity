norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .
" bild " editor kai diekmann defended his paper 's reports .
" when a politician from the left or the right takes perks at the taxpayers ' cost , then it is the duty of journalists – regardless whether they work for the ' süddeutsche zeitung ' or ' bild ' — to expose it , " he told the " süddeutsche zeitung " newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.08.2002 the fight to let it all hang out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates of nudism are not welcomed by all germans when summer temperatures soar , so do tempers over the amount of flesh shown in germany 's public places .
dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .
but franzi was always expected to perform at a world-class level – and the combination was just too much ! " , regine eichhorn , van almsick ’ s manager says .
the pressure of being constantly in the limelight , of living up to her first successes and a string of injuries proved too much for germany ’ s celebrated youngster .
franzi fled the media attention , seeking support and consolation from her family .
the media reacted by raining ridicule on their former favourite , including the " franzi van speck " -lrb- " franzi van fat " -rrb- headline in a popular tabloid daily after franzi ’ s disastrous performance at the 2000 olympics in sydney .
however , the sydney games also marked a fundamental turn in franzi ’ s unhappy life .
it was here that she met and fell in love with stefan kretschmar , the german basketball player .
with their relationship , her lust for life returned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her recent success in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first sign in two years that " goldfish franzi " , as the germans like to call her , may well be back on track .
still a dominant media presence today , franziska says " my personal life is in great shape .
i have a fantastic family and a fantastic boyfriend .
i ’ m just perfectly happy ! " .
while franzi proves her swimming prowess in the pools in berlin , her face adorns posters and screens across the city in a new austrian mineral water campaign .

the pressure of being constantly in the limelight , of living up to her first successes and a string of injuries proved too much for germany ’ s celebrated youngster .
franzi fled the media attention , seeking support and consolation from her family .
the media reacted by raining ridicule on their former favourite , including the " franzi van speck " -lrb- " franzi van fat " -rrb- headline in a popular tabloid daily after franzi ’ s disastrous performance at the 2000 olympics in sydney .
however , the sydney games also marked a fundamental turn in franzi ’ s unhappy life .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .
" bild " editor kai diekmann defended his paper 's reports .

gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .
" bild " editor kai diekmann defended his paper 's reports .
" when a politician from the left or the right takes perks at the taxpayers ' cost , then it is the duty of journalists – regardless whether they work for the ' süddeutsche zeitung ' or ' bild ' — to expose it , " he told the " süddeutsche zeitung " newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .
but franzi was always expected to perform at a world-class level – and the combination was just too much ! " , regine eichhorn , van almsick ’ s manager says .
the pressure of being constantly in the limelight , of living up to her first successes and a string of injuries proved too much for germany ’ s celebrated youngster .
franzi fled the media attention , seeking support and consolation from her family .
the media reacted by raining ridicule on their former favourite , including the " franzi van speck " -lrb- " franzi van fat " -rrb- headline in a popular tabloid daily after franzi ’ s disastrous performance at the 2000 olympics in sydney .
however , the sydney games also marked a fundamental turn in franzi ’ s unhappy life .
it was here that she met and fell in love with stefan kretschmar , the german basketball player .
with their relationship , her lust for life returned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her recent success in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first sign in two years that " goldfish franzi " , as the germans like to call her , may well be back on track .
still a dominant media presence today , franziska says " my personal life is in great shape .
i have a fantastic family and a fantastic boyfriend .
i ’ m just perfectly happy ! " .
while franzi proves her swimming prowess in the pools in berlin , her face adorns posters and screens across the city in a new austrian mineral water campaign .
but the days when van almsick was named " franzi van fat " are not forgotten .
the advertisers have swapped the feminine figure on the poster from the neck down for that of an – obviously slimmer - model . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links franziska van almsick homepage 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.08.2002 norway imposes quota for top women in business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the norwegian who 's who of business may no longer be a roll call for the old boy network .
norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .
but in austria , however , a mere 4.1 per cent has taken over leading roles in this future market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking through the glass ceiling the study " woman and power " published at a conference in berlin takes a look at the obstacles in women 's careers , and at what motivates women to push their way through these barriers to the top .

norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .
but in austria , however , a mere 4.1 per cent has taken over leading roles in this future market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking through the glass ceiling the study " woman and power " published at a conference in berlin takes a look at the obstacles in women 's careers , and at what motivates women to push their way through these barriers to the top .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .
but franzi was always expected to perform at a world-class level – and the combination was just too much ! " , regine eichhorn , van almsick ’ s manager says .
the pressure of being constantly in the limelight , of living up to her first successes and a string of injuries proved too much for germany ’ s celebrated youngster .
franzi fled the media attention , seeking support and consolation from her family .
the media reacted by raining ridicule on their former favourite , including the " franzi van speck " -lrb- " franzi van fat " -rrb- headline in a popular tabloid daily after franzi ’ s disastrous performance at the 2000 olympics in sydney .
however , the sydney games also marked a fundamental turn in franzi ’ s unhappy life .
it was here that she met and fell in love with stefan kretschmar , the german basketball player .
with their relationship , her lust for life returned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her recent success in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first sign in two years that " goldfish franzi " , as the germans like to call her , may well be back on track .
still a dominant media presence today , franziska says " my personal life is in great shape .
i have a fantastic family and a fantastic boyfriend .
i ’ m just perfectly happy ! " .
while franzi proves her swimming prowess in the pools in berlin , her face adorns posters and screens across the city in a new austrian mineral water campaign .
but the days when van almsick was named " franzi van fat " are not forgotten .
the advertisers have swapped the feminine figure on the poster from the neck down for that of an – obviously slimmer - model . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links franziska van almsick homepage 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.08.2002 norway imposes quota for top women in business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the norwegian who 's who of business may no longer be a roll call for the old boy network .
norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .
but in austria , however , a mere 4.1 per cent has taken over leading roles in this future market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking through the glass ceiling the study " woman and power " published at a conference in berlin takes a look at the obstacles in women 's careers , and at what motivates women to push their way through these barriers to the top .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.08.2002 bonus mile scandal consumes a top berlin official großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi : " i made an inexcusable mistake . "
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .
" bild " editor kai diekmann defended his paper 's reports .
" when a politician from the left or the right takes perks at the taxpayers ' cost , then it is the duty of journalists – regardless whether they work for the ' süddeutsche zeitung ' or ' bild ' — to expose it , " he told the " süddeutsche zeitung " newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .
but franzi was always expected to perform at a world-class level – and the combination was just too much ! " , regine eichhorn , van almsick ’ s manager says .
the pressure of being constantly in the limelight , of living up to her first successes and a string of injuries proved too much for germany ’ s celebrated youngster .
franzi fled the media attention , seeking support and consolation from her family .
the media reacted by raining ridicule on their former favourite , including the " franzi van speck " -lrb- " franzi van fat " -rrb- headline in a popular tabloid daily after franzi ’ s disastrous performance at the 2000 olympics in sydney .
however , the sydney games also marked a fundamental turn in franzi ’ s unhappy life .
it was here that she met and fell in love with stefan kretschmar , the german basketball player .
with their relationship , her lust for life returned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her recent success in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first sign in two years that " goldfish franzi " , as the germans like to call her , may well be back on track .
still a dominant media presence today , franziska says " my personal life is in great shape .
i have a fantastic family and a fantastic boyfriend .
i ’ m just perfectly happy ! " .
while franzi proves her swimming prowess in the pools in berlin , her face adorns posters and screens across the city in a new austrian mineral water campaign .
but the days when van almsick was named " franzi van fat " are not forgotten .

norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .
but franzi was always expected to perform at a world-class level – and the combination was just too much ! " , regine eichhorn , van almsick ’ s manager says .
the pressure of being constantly in the limelight , of living up to her first successes and a string of injuries proved too much for germany ’ s celebrated youngster .
franzi fled the media attention , seeking support and consolation from her family .
the media reacted by raining ridicule on their former favourite , including the " franzi van speck " -lrb- " franzi van fat " -rrb- headline in a popular tabloid daily after franzi ’ s disastrous performance at the 2000 olympics in sydney .
however , the sydney games also marked a fundamental turn in franzi ’ s unhappy life .
it was here that she met and fell in love with stefan kretschmar , the german basketball player .
with their relationship , her lust for life returned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her recent success in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first sign in two years that " goldfish franzi " , as the germans like to call her , may well be back on track .
still a dominant media presence today , franziska says " my personal life is in great shape .
i have a fantastic family and a fantastic boyfriend .
i ’ m just perfectly happy ! " .
while franzi proves her swimming prowess in the pools in berlin , her face adorns posters and screens across the city in a new austrian mineral water campaign .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .
but franzi was always expected to perform at a world-class level – and the combination was just too much ! " , regine eichhorn , van almsick ’ s manager says .
the pressure of being constantly in the limelight , of living up to her first successes and a string of injuries proved too much for germany ’ s celebrated youngster .
franzi fled the media attention , seeking support and consolation from her family .
the media reacted by raining ridicule on their former favourite , including the " franzi van speck " -lrb- " franzi van fat " -rrb- headline in a popular tabloid daily after franzi ’ s disastrous performance at the 2000 olympics in sydney .
however , the sydney games also marked a fundamental turn in franzi ’ s unhappy life .
it was here that she met and fell in love with stefan kretschmar , the german basketball player .
with their relationship , her lust for life returned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her recent success in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first sign in two years that " goldfish franzi " , as the germans like to call her , may well be back on track .
still a dominant media presence today , franziska says " my personal life is in great shape .
i have a fantastic family and a fantastic boyfriend .
i ’ m just perfectly happy ! " .
while franzi proves her swimming prowess in the pools in berlin , her face adorns posters and screens across the city in a new austrian mineral water campaign .
but the days when van almsick was named " franzi van fat " are not forgotten .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.08.2002 norway imposes quota for top women in business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the norwegian who 's who of business may no longer be a roll call for the old boy network .
norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .
but in austria , however , a mere 4.1 per cent has taken over leading roles in this future market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking through the glass ceiling the study " woman and power " published at a conference in berlin takes a look at the obstacles in women 's careers , and at what motivates women to push their way through these barriers to the top .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.08.2002 norway imposes quota for top women in business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the norwegian who 's who of business may no longer be a roll call for the old boy network .
norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .
but franzi was always expected to perform at a world-class level – and the combination was just too much ! " , regine eichhorn , van almsick ’ s manager says .
the pressure of being constantly in the limelight , of living up to her first successes and a string of injuries proved too much for germany ’ s celebrated youngster .
franzi fled the media attention , seeking support and consolation from her family .
the media reacted by raining ridicule on their former favourite , including the " franzi van speck " -lrb- " franzi van fat " -rrb- headline in a popular tabloid daily after franzi ’ s disastrous performance at the 2000 olympics in sydney .
however , the sydney games also marked a fundamental turn in franzi ’ s unhappy life .
it was here that she met and fell in love with stefan kretschmar , the german basketball player .
with their relationship , her lust for life returned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her recent success in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first sign in two years that " goldfish franzi " , as the germans like to call her , may well be back on track .
still a dominant media presence today , franziska says " my personal life is in great shape .

i ’ m just perfectly happy ! " .
while franzi proves her swimming prowess in the pools in berlin , her face adorns posters and screens across the city in a new austrian mineral water campaign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.08.2002 the fight to let it all hang out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates of nudism are not welcomed by all germans when summer temperatures soar , so do tempers over the amount of flesh shown in germany 's public places .
dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .

norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .
but franzi was always expected to perform at a world-class level – and the combination was just too much ! " , regine eichhorn , van almsick ’ s manager says .
the pressure of being constantly in the limelight , of living up to her first successes and a string of injuries proved too much for germany ’ s celebrated youngster .
franzi fled the media attention , seeking support and consolation from her family .
the media reacted by raining ridicule on their former favourite , including the " franzi van speck " -lrb- " franzi van fat " -rrb- headline in a popular tabloid daily after franzi ’ s disastrous performance at the 2000 olympics in sydney .
however , the sydney games also marked a fundamental turn in franzi ’ s unhappy life .
it was here that she met and fell in love with stefan kretschmar , the german basketball player .
with their relationship , her lust for life returned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her recent success in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first sign in two years that " goldfish franzi " , as the germans like to call her , may well be back on track .
still a dominant media presence today , franziska says " my personal life is in great shape .
i have a fantastic family and a fantastic boyfriend .
i ’ m just perfectly happy ! " .
while franzi proves her swimming prowess in the pools in berlin , her face adorns posters and screens across the city in a new austrian mineral water campaign .
but the days when van almsick was named " franzi van fat " are not forgotten .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .

the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .

in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .

norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .
but franzi was always expected to perform at a world-class level – and the combination was just too much ! " , regine eichhorn , van almsick ’ s manager says .
the pressure of being constantly in the limelight , of living up to her first successes and a string of injuries proved too much for germany ’ s celebrated youngster .
franzi fled the media attention , seeking support and consolation from her family .
the media reacted by raining ridicule on their former favourite , including the " franzi van speck " -lrb- " franzi van fat " -rrb- headline in a popular tabloid daily after franzi ’ s disastrous performance at the 2000 olympics in sydney .
however , the sydney games also marked a fundamental turn in franzi ’ s unhappy life .
it was here that she met and fell in love with stefan kretschmar , the german basketball player .
with their relationship , her lust for life returned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her recent success in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first sign in two years that " goldfish franzi " , as the germans like to call her , may well be back on track .
still a dominant media presence today , franziska says " my personal life is in great shape .
i have a fantastic family and a fantastic boyfriend .
i ’ m just perfectly happy ! " .
while franzi proves her swimming prowess in the pools in berlin , her face adorns posters and screens across the city in a new austrian mineral water campaign .
but the days when van almsick was named " franzi van fat " are not forgotten .
the advertisers have swapped the feminine figure on the poster from the neck down for that of an – obviously slimmer - model . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links franziska van almsick homepage 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .
" bild " editor kai diekmann defended his paper 's reports .
" when a politician from the left or the right takes perks at the taxpayers ' cost , then it is the duty of journalists – regardless whether they work for the ' süddeutsche zeitung ' or ' bild ' — to expose it , " he told the " süddeutsche zeitung " newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.08.2002 german swim diva surfaces after a two-year dive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gold win - franzi at the european swimming championships germany 's franziska van almsick swam her way to gold at the european swimming championships on tuesday .
a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .
but franzi was always expected to perform at a world-class level – and the combination was just too much ! " , regine eichhorn , van almsick ’ s manager says .
the pressure of being constantly in the limelight , of living up to her first successes and a string of injuries proved too much for germany ’ s celebrated youngster .
franzi fled the media attention , seeking support and consolation from her family .
the media reacted by raining ridicule on their former favourite , including the " franzi van speck " -lrb- " franzi van fat " -rrb- headline in a popular tabloid daily after franzi ’ s disastrous performance at the 2000 olympics in sydney .
however , the sydney games also marked a fundamental turn in franzi ’ s unhappy life .
it was here that she met and fell in love with stefan kretschmar , the german basketball player .
with their relationship , her lust for life returned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her recent success in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first sign in two years that " goldfish franzi " , as the germans like to call her , may well be back on track .
still a dominant media presence today , franziska says " my personal life is in great shape .
i have a fantastic family and a fantastic boyfriend .
i ’ m just perfectly happy ! " .
while franzi proves her swimming prowess in the pools in berlin , her face adorns posters and screens across the city in a new austrian mineral water campaign .
but the days when van almsick was named " franzi van fat " are not forgotten .
the advertisers have swapped the feminine figure on the poster from the neck down for that of an – obviously slimmer - model . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links franziska van almsick homepage 9797 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .
" bild " editor kai diekmann defended his paper 's reports .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .
indeed , at the english partner club of weinreich ’ s local nudist group in bonn , one of newest members is a gentleman who was recently knighted by the queen . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german association for free body culture -lrb- in german only -rrb- media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.08.2002 norway imposes quota for top women in business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the norwegian who 's who of business may no longer be a roll call for the old boy network .
norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.08.2002 the fight to let it all hang out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates of nudism are not welcomed by all germans when summer temperatures soar , so do tempers over the amount of flesh shown in germany 's public places .
dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .
indeed , at the english partner club of weinreich ’ s local nudist group in bonn , one of newest members is a gentleman who was recently knighted by the queen . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german association for free body culture -lrb- in german only -rrb- dw-tv europe live in focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .

at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .
" bild " editor kai diekmann defended his paper 's reports .
" when a politician from the left or the right takes perks at the taxpayers ' cost , then it is the duty of journalists – regardless whether they work for the ' süddeutsche zeitung ' or ' bild ' — to expose it , " he told the " süddeutsche zeitung " newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.08.2002 the fight to let it all hang out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates of nudism are not welcomed by all germans when summer temperatures soar , so do tempers over the amount of flesh shown in germany 's public places .
dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .
indeed , at the english partner club of weinreich ’ s local nudist group in bonn , one of newest members is a gentleman who was recently knighted by the queen . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german association for free body culture -lrb- in german only -rrb- 9800 dw-tv europe live projekt zukunft we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .
" bild " editor kai diekmann defended his paper 's reports .
" when a politician from the left or the right takes perks at the taxpayers ' cost , then it is the duty of journalists – regardless whether they work for the ' süddeutsche zeitung ' or ' bild ' — to expose it , " he told the " süddeutsche zeitung " newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .
indeed , at the english partner club of weinreich ’ s local nudist group in bonn , one of newest members is a gentleman who was recently knighted by the queen . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german association for free body culture -lrb- in german only -rrb- 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .
but franzi was always expected to perform at a world-class level – and the combination was just too much ! " , regine eichhorn , van almsick ’ s manager says .
the pressure of being constantly in the limelight , of living up to her first successes and a string of injuries proved too much for germany ’ s celebrated youngster .
franzi fled the media attention , seeking support and consolation from her family .
the media reacted by raining ridicule on their former favourite , including the " franzi van speck " -lrb- " franzi van fat " -rrb- headline in a popular tabloid daily after franzi ’ s disastrous performance at the 2000 olympics in sydney .
however , the sydney games also marked a fundamental turn in franzi ’ s unhappy life .
it was here that she met and fell in love with stefan kretschmar , the german basketball player .
with their relationship , her lust for life returned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her recent success in berlin -lrb- photo -rrb- was the first sign in two years that " goldfish franzi " , as the germans like to call her , may well be back on track .
still a dominant media presence today , franziska says " my personal life is in great shape .
i have a fantastic family and a fantastic boyfriend .
i ’ m just perfectly happy ! " .
while franzi proves her swimming prowess in the pools in berlin , her face adorns posters and screens across the city in a new austrian mineral water campaign .

norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .
indeed , at the english partner club of weinreich ’ s local nudist group in bonn , one of newest members is a gentleman who was recently knighted by the queen . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german association for free body culture -lrb- in german only -rrb- 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .
indeed , at the english partner club of weinreich ’ s local nudist group in bonn , one of newest members is a gentleman who was recently knighted by the queen . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german association for free body culture -lrb- in german only -rrb- 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .
" bild " editor kai diekmann defended his paper 's reports .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .
indeed , at the english partner club of weinreich ’ s local nudist group in bonn , one of newest members is a gentleman who was recently knighted by the queen . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german association for free body culture -lrb- in german only -rrb- 9799 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .
" bild " editor kai diekmann defended his paper 's reports .
" when a politician from the left or the right takes perks at the taxpayers ' cost , then it is the duty of journalists – regardless whether they work for the ' süddeutsche zeitung ' or ' bild ' — to expose it , " he told the " süddeutsche zeitung " newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .

from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .
indeed , at the english partner club of weinreich ’ s local nudist group in bonn , one of newest members is a gentleman who was recently knighted by the queen . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german association for free body culture -lrb- in german only -rrb- 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .
indeed , at the english partner club of weinreich ’ s local nudist group in bonn , one of newest members is a gentleman who was recently knighted by the queen . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german association for free body culture -lrb- in german only -rrb- 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .
indeed , at the english partner club of weinreich ’ s local nudist group in bonn , one of newest members is a gentleman who was recently knighted by the queen . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german association for free body culture -lrb- in german only -rrb- 9801 dw-tv europe live made in germany we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .

"
gregor gysi announced wednesday he would resign from his post as berlin 's deputy mayor after admitting he used frequent flyer miles racked up on government travel for personal trips . germany 's growing " bonus miles " scandal claimed yet another politician on wednesday with the surprise resignation of the city-state of berlin 's deputy mayor and economics minister , gregor gysi .
earlier this week , gysi admitted to abusing his frequent flier miles during his time in the bundestag , germany 's parliament .
he offered his resignation on wednesday evening .
" i made a mistake that there 's no excuse for , " gysi said .
in doing so , he became the second politician in one week to quit his office over the scandal .
after admitting financial ties to frankfurt public relations executive moritz hunziger , who served as a private banker to his political friends in berlin , as well as using government bonus miles for personal trips , rising turkish political star cem özdemir handed in his resignation over the weekend .
gysi 's resignation marked the end of a remarkable rise for the longtime leader of the parliamentary group of the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor party to east germany 's communists .
flamboyant gysi recently ran to become mayor of berlin .
he lost to social democrat klaus wowereit , but the pds did score enough votes to enter into a coalition government .
media-savvy gysi landed a slot as the city-state 's economics minister and wowereit 's number two .
tired of office ?
but in recent years , gysi had expressed frustration with german politics .
" my decision the year before last to leave politics was the right one , but my hasty return , as i realize today , was a mistake .
that 's why i 've stepped down from my political offices , " he said on wednesday .
since he took office in berlin six months ago , some have questioned whether best-selling author and talk show regular gysi could hold his interest in political office .
manfred güllner , head of the forsa public opinion research institute asked the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " newspaper in june : " would he rather take small parts in talk shows or will he stick it out through the entire legislative period until 2005 ? "
wowereit said wednesday that he regretted gysi 's decision .
" i have to respect his decision and thank him for our fruitful work together , " he said .
a growing scandal a handful of other prominent german politicians have already been enveloped by the scandal , and it threatens to grow .
the country 's environment minister , jürgen trittin , has also been caught up in the affair .
trittin is a leading member of the governing coalition 's junior partner the greens .
trittin has denied allegations of wrongdoing .
the environment minister said he never used the miles from business trips for private travel : " i pay for private trips with private income .
since becoming a member of the government i have taken five personal trips with bonus miles earned on my private flights . "
günter nooke , the deputy leader of the christian democratic union and christian social union parliamentary group , has also denied accusations of using frequent flier miles he racked up on government work for personal travel .
the scandal has created a major crisis in berlin as new names emerge .
on wednesday , the president of the bundestag , social democrat wolfgang thierse , sought to stop the blood-letting , saying he did n't think politicians implicated in the scandal should resign .
" i do n't think that 's an appropriate reaction , " he said , adding that it was better for them to recognize ethical standards .
lufthansa and tabloid criticized two other parties – national flagship air carrier lufthansa and the mass-circulation newspaper " bild " – have also been the subject of enormous criticism this week for their roles in the affair .
thierse accused lufthansa of supplying names of politicians to the newspaper in violation of the country 's personal data protection law .
the airline has so far refused to turn over a list of all elected officials who have used miles racked up during government travel for personal use .
the government has sought the list so that it can get a grasp on the scope of the problem .
meanwhile , social democratic party general-secretary franz müntefering has accused the " bild " newspaper of playing party politics in favor of the conservative opposition during an election year .
initially , the paper accused three green party members and one member of the party of democratic socialism of using government miles for personal travel .
however , by thursday , the paper published the names of politicians from almost every major political party in the country accused of abusing their government mileage accounts .
" bild " editor kai diekmann defended his paper 's reports .
" when a politician from the left or the right takes perks at the taxpayers ' cost , then it is the duty of journalists – regardless whether they work for the ' süddeutsche zeitung ' or ' bild ' — to expose it , " he told the " süddeutsche zeitung " newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

dw-world talks to an expert on the roots , uniqueness and apparent east-west divide in german " free body culture . " " one of our aims is to show that germans do not only wear lederhosen , but very often nothing at all ! "
wolfgang weinreich says cheerfully .
with 60,000 registered nudists , 160 german nudist clubs , and the summer season at its peak , weinreich , vice president of the german association for free body culture , is a busy man .
in addition , weinreich , who is also president of the international naturists federation , is getting ready for the annual world naturists congress which takes place in florida this august .
" each national nudist movement has its own focus points " , weinrich says .
" but we all have one common aim : to make nudist life possible at as many places as achieveable " , he says .
a common sight in summer , naked flesh is no uncommon sight in german parks , pools and beaches .
according to weinreich , some 10 million germans strip to the bare essentials at least once or twice during the hot and sweaty summer months .
the germans are known to be quicker than their fellow europeans at letting it all hang out - a phenomenon that according to weinreich lies in the history of european nudism , a movement that has its origins in 19th century berlin .
" in the wake of industrialism , and the continuing alienation from nature , the berliners took to fleeing the city to the many surrounding lakes , and began bathing naked . "
it didn ’ t take long for other europeans to acknowledge this historically scandalous show of flesh and introduce naked bathing in their home countries .
repressed free body culture from then on , the naturist movement was to grow steadily all over europe .
but german movement received a major blow in 1933 when the nazis came to power and outlawed nudism .
after the war , it was with the help of the british that germany ’ s nudist movement got back on track , not least due to " a british major who signed a symbolic official approval " .
from then on , the number of german nudists has grown steadily , reaching its peak a decade ago , with some 70,000 dedicated naturists .
since then the number has dropped by 10,000 .
but according to weinrich , the grey zone of those who strip occasionally has climbed to around 10 million .
indeed , naturism is still highly popular in germany , especially in the summer : from the baltic to the north sea there are scores of beaches bearing the sign fkk – german for free body culture .
of the 600,000 holidaymakers on the popular island resort of sylt , 200,000 alone are estimated to be nudists .
east-west divide but not all is sun and fun in germany ’ s nudist world .
less than a decade ago , both temperature and tempers were soaring on germany ’ s beaches , as western germans complained that eastern germans ’ desire to let it all hang out just went too far .
the dispute was sparked on the baltic sea coasts of what used to be east germany , which were literally invaded by wealthy western germans after the fall of the wall .
the wessis , as western germans are known , wanted separate beaches for nudist sunbathers , and naked flesh-free zones on the resorts ’ main beaches , where they could enjoy their holidays in peace , free from the sight of any eastern german genitalia .
" it was seen as unreasonable to expect wealthy tourists to bear naked skin " , weinreich says .
" but in eastern germany going naked was something very normal " , he says .
too much flesh in what was otherwise a highly regimented society , communist east germany had a somewhat relaxed attitude towards nudity and sexual expression .
some former east germans say it was the only really known freedom they ever had .
today , eastern germans have had to come to terms with the current sealed off " fkk " beaches , which are often to be found far away from any tourist resort centre .
but the question of bare flesh remains a hot topic in germany , as a recent dispute in munich over naked sunbathers in the famous english garden showed .
in addition , last month ’ s annual love parade , to which some 1 million ravers flocked to berlin ’ s city centre in various states of undress , caused concern over what seemed like an unwritten licence for people to let it all hang out in one of berlin ’ s most historic , and most beautiful parks – only a stone ’ s throw from the german president ’ s official residence .
more room for nudes " our main aim may be to increase the number of places where people can go naked " , weinreich says .
" but this doesn ’ t mean we endorse people taking their clothes off in public places " .
the german association for free body culture is therefore looking for more places where naturists can meet in peace , without imposing their nudity on those who may be offended by the constant sight of naked flesh , according to weinreich . international naturists ’ congress health and environment are topics which delegates from nudist associations all over the world will debate at the international naturists federation congress later in august .
weinreich is already looking forward to meeting old friends who all have one thing in common – a penchant for stripping down to the bare essentials .
" the great thing about nudists , no matter where they come from , is that at get togethers , everyone is equal .
no one can show off with their newest brioni suit or shiny rolex , there are no national borders , and there there are no differences of class " , he says .
indeed , at the english partner club of weinreich ’ s local nudist group in bonn , one of newest members is a gentleman who was recently knighted by the queen . louise brown send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links german association for free body culture -lrb- in german only -rrb- 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.08.2002 norway imposes quota for top women in business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the norwegian who 's who of business may no longer be a roll call for the old boy network .
norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .
but in austria , however , a mere 4.1 per cent has taken over leading roles in this future market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking through the glass ceiling the study " woman and power " published at a conference in berlin takes a look at the obstacles in women 's careers , and at what motivates women to push their way through these barriers to the top .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.08.2002 norway imposes quota for top women in business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the norwegian who 's who of business may no longer be a roll call for the old boy network .
norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .
but in austria , however , a mere 4.1 per cent has taken over leading roles in this future market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking through the glass ceiling the study " woman and power " published at a conference in berlin takes a look at the obstacles in women 's careers , and at what motivates women to push their way through these barriers to the top .

a far cry from 2000 , when she was written off by the media after a row of injuries and personal problems . her concentration on her sport was clear for all to see : at the european championships in berlin on tuesday , franziska van almsick was still meditating as her teammates took to the water for the 4x200 relay .
but only a matter of minutes later , franzi , as she is popularly known , rounded off the race by powering to gold .
after two years in the sporting doldrums , franziska van almsick , germany ’ s most well known swimming star , is back in the limelight .
on wednesday , the 24-year-old won one of her fastest races in recent months , plowing her way to a gold win in the 100 metres freestyle race .
after the race , an obviously overwhelmed van almsick told reporters : " this is the happiest moment of my life ! " .
natural swimmer , born winner franziska van almsick was born in berlin in 1978 .
when she was 5 , she followed her brother doggedly to his swiming training at a local sportscentre .
it was here , in an east german sports centre that her love and talent for swimming were born .
at the age of 11 , she won her first gold medals at a nationwide german youth contest .
it was in 1992 , at the barcelona olympics , that the 14-year-old made her first major breakthrough , returning home from the contest with 4 medals in her suitcase .
franziska ’ s greatest triumph was in 1994 at the world championships , when she swam the best race in her life , setting a world record in the 200 metres freestyle final , which still stands today .
darling of the media by this time franziska von almsick was already a star on the international stage .
famed for her natural good looks , easygoing attitude and perky sassisness , she soon became the darling of the press .
within months of her first major swimming success , the berlinerin graced posters and screens advertising for products ranging from chocolate and cars to skin cream and fashion .
but with the persistent media focus on franzi ’ s sporting - and in particular - private sphere , the swimming princess ' seemingly perfect life began to unravel .
life under media glare takes its toll " at 17 or 18 – when other girls are battling through puberty far from the spotlight – she was a media darling .
that ’ s an age when you ’ re more preoccupied with yourself .
but franzi was always expected to perform at a world-class level – and the combination was just too much ! " , regine eichhorn , van almsick ’ s manager says .

norway is about to become the first country in the world to insist on female quotas for company boardrooms . in a revolutionary move that has delighted unions and outraged big business , the norwegian government ordered companies to ensure that at least 40 per cent of their board members are women .
state-owned firms have been given one year to comply while the country 's 650 major private companies have three years .
the government plans to back up their decree with legislation . the announcement has infuriated the country 's employers ' federation , which says the decree may make norway uncompetitive .
it also fears that foreign firms may be discouraged from setting up operations in norway due to the quota regulations .
companies disagree with government pressure sigrun vageng , of the federation 's equality department , agreed too few women were reaching boardroom level but said companies should be allowed to resolve the problem of their own accord .
" we do n't think the solution is having a new law , " vageng told a press conference . " it should be up to shareholders to decide whether or not women are appointed to boardroom positions . "
women make up a mere 7 per cent of the country 's boardroom elite although the european average is still only two per cent .
even though norway prides itself on being one of the world 's most egalitarian societies , calls from successive governments to improve the situation in the country 's boardrooms have come to naught .
the push for further reforms has led to the tough new stance .
minister threatens legislation if 40 per cent is not met " if they do n't succeed the law will be changed , " said martin bernsen , spokesman for laila davoy , the minister for children and family affairs .
" the minister is very angry about the current situation . "
in a scenario that is all too familiar in many industrialised countries , the profile of norway 's power brokers shows the typical board member to be male , over 55 years of age and from a background in law and economics .
boardroom opportunities mainly fall to members of the same ' old boy network ' , something the norwegians want to change .
' not enough qualified women ' , protest companies protests from many companies hinge on the claim that they will not be able to find enough suitably qualified women to fill 40 per cent of boardroom posts .
bernsen says government research has shown otherwise .
" we have proven that there are lots of educated , highly qualified women out there with the right experience .
but firms have to go and look for them , " he said in a question and answer session with the international press .
trade unions in norway , who have lobbied for female quotas for the past 20 years , said they were delighted with the new decree .
" companies need to be forced to hire more women or else they wo n't do it and if things were left as they are today , it would be a hundred years before we have women making up 40 per cent of company boards , " said mie opdordsmoen of lo , the country 's biggest union , in britain 's guardian newspaper .
informal gender quotas have existed in norway since 1981 when the country 's first female prime minister , gro harlem brundtland , took power .
since then , women have held around 40 per cent of government posts .
it is this level that has prompted the push for the figure to be adopted and enforced across the business landscape .
european equality progress has been slow and uneven however , in other countries in europe , while women gradually increase their share of managerial work and positions , one thing has remained clear : the rate of change has been slow and the pace of progress uneven .
in 2002 , 30 per cent of managers in the eu 's 15 member states were female .
in 1992 , when the eu consisted of 11 member states , 29.5 per cent of managers were female .
in germany , daimerchrysler has introduced a so-called " soft " women quota whereas shell has committed itself to raise the number of women in managing positions to 20 per cent .
other companies , such as lufthansa , deutsche bank , telekom , bosch and procter & gamble have , in the past years , built up an extensive combined mentoring programme for women .
while some businesses wake up to equality , in some sectors the number of women managers is still low .
according to a recent survey by the international data corporation , france is one of the leading countries in the computer technology field – with a percentage of 9.1 per cent .
but in austria , however , a mere 4.1 per cent has taken over leading roles in this future market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breaking through the glass ceiling the study " woman and power " published at a conference in berlin takes a look at the obstacles in women 's careers , and at what motivates women to push their way through these barriers to the top .

a report by the international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- says the assembly succeeded in according national legitimacy to afghanistan 's peace process and peacefully electing a popular leader - hamid karzai - as transitional president .
former king : forced to step aside but , it adds , an all-consuming concern for short-term stability caused key afghan and international decision makers to bow to undemocratic sectarian demands .
the transitional authority which emerged from the loya jirga , the report warns , will be hampered by its compromises .
delegates to the loya jirga were under no illusion that this would be a fully democratic process , but nevertheless many were disappointed when it became immediately obvious that many of the decisions would be made outside the tent .
' delegates intimidated ' the opening of the assembly was delayed as afghanistan 's former king came under pressure from washington , the united nations and key afghan officials to disavow any possible candidacy .
unelected delegates - including unreconstructed , and unpopular , warlords - were appointed at the last moment .
delegates were monitored or even intimidated .
karzai " can not continue to avoid confrontation " even the process of electing mr karzai was marred by irregularities and improprieties , including pressure being put on would-be opponents .
such moves , says the report , stoked fears among many delegates that they were window-dressing for a hidden process , governed by intimidation and power struggles , which allowed no safe space for democratic participation or opposition .
now afghanistan 's transitional authority faces tremendous challenges , says the report .
powerful regional warlords have been given places in it and have pledged their loyalty .
but their true willingess to submit to central authority has yet to be tested .
the report concludes that president karzai must now show strength - he can not continue to avoid all confrontations with commanders around the country and in his own government .

a report by the international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- says the assembly succeeded in according national legitimacy to afghanistan 's peace process and peacefully electing a popular leader - hamid karzai - as transitional president .
but , it adds , an all-consuming concern for short-term stability caused key afghan and international decision makers to bow to undemocratic sectarian demands .
the transitional authority which emerged from the loya jirga , the report warns , will be hampered by its compromises .
delegates to the loya jirga were under no illusion that this would be a fully democratic process , but nevertheless many were disappointed when it became immediately obvious that many of the decisions would be made outside the tent .
' delegates intimidated ' the opening of the assembly was delayed as afghanistan 's former king came under pressure from washington , the united nations and key afghan officials to disavow any possible candidacy .
unelected delegates - including unreconstructed , and unpopular , warlords - were appointed at the last moment .
delegates were monitored or even intimidated .
even the process of electing mr karzai was marred by irregularities and improprieties , including pressure being put on would-be opponents .
such moves , says the report , stoked fears among many delegates that they were window-dressing for a hidden process , governed by intimidation and power struggles , which allowed no safe space for democratic participation or opposition .
now afghanistan 's transitional authority faces tremendous challenges , says the report .
powerful regional warlords have been given places in it and have pledged their loyalty .
but their true willingess to submit to central authority has yet to be tested .
the report concludes that president karzai must now show strength - he can not continue to avoid all confrontations with commanders around the country and in his own government .

the three-kilometre-wide chasm named " silverpit crater " was punched into the crust 60-65 million years ago , and seems very well preserved 1,000 metres -lrb- 3,300 feet -rrb- beneath the sea bed .
two aberdeen-based geologists looking for hydrocarbons in the trent north sea gas field were re-examining 3d seismic reflection surveys that were done in 1992 when they made the discovery .
we are as sure as we can be that silverpit is the uk 's first impact crater phil allen , uk geophysicist using the very latest seismic interpretation software , geophysicist phil allen had been studying deep carboniferous rocks which form the gas field , when he found a structure that caught his eye higher up in younger rocks .
despite 30 years of experience he said he had never seen anything like it .
" i thought it could have been caused by an impact , " recalls allen , " but it could equally have been created by another process . "
unable to resolve its origin further , allen pinned a printout of the mystery structure to the office wall with the caption , " anybody seen anything like this ? "
' eureka ' moment it was six months before he got a reliable answer , when structural geologist dr simon stewart walked into the office to discuss the gas field .
unbeknown to allen , stewart was something of an expert on the geological causes of circular structures and immediately recognised the central peaked cone on allen 's printout as a characteristic of an impact crater .
the first image of the silverpit crater courtesy pgl / bp the 3d profile alone was not enough to confirm that the structure was caused by an asteroid impact , and even two exploration holes drilled through the crater structure in 1984 and 1993 were not enough to establish its catastrophic origin .
allen and stewart looked to regional magnetic data and seismic reflections of older rocks beneath the crater to rule out volcanism or a rising plume of salt .
" we are as sure as we can be that silverpit is the uk 's first impact crater , " says stewart .
judging by the size of the crater and the density of the surrounding rocks , the asteroid or comet that made it probably weighed around two million tonnes and could have been 120 metres -lrb- 390 feet -rrb- across .
it would have impacted into a shallow sea that covered britain back then and would have sent disastrous tsunami tidal waves surging across the nearby cretaceous land masses .
' outer ripples ' the geologists say the crater has been uniquely " fossilised " , by sediments settling into the depression , and is unlike any other impact crater so far found on earth .
tyre crater on one of jupiter 's icy moons , europa courtesy pgl / bp " other craters on earth we know about were created in hard rocks , whereas silverpit would have been formed in soft underwater sediments - creating a very different shape of crater , " explains stewart .
a tall conical central peak is buried inside a three-kilometre- -lrb- two-mile- -rrb- diameter crater that is itself surrounded by a series of concentric rings which extend out a further eight kilometres -lrb- five miles -rrb- in each direction .
" unparalleled 3d mapping of these concentric features down to a resolution of tens of metres shows that the outer ripples are caused by concentric faults in chalk on the sea floor around the central crater that were probably triggered by the impact , " says stewart .
its shape and size stand silverpit apart from other craters in the inner solar system and its closest relative appears to be the valhalla impact structure on jupiter 's moon callisto .
a significant first " the strength of this find is that because we 've got such a clear 3d image of the whole thing we can explore its whole anatomy , " says stewart .
" for the first time ever we 've had the opportunity to map the ' skeleton ' of a crater - not just its surface expression . "
with the growing amount of 3d seismic data being gathered across the world 's oceans , the geologists think there 's a good chance that silverpit will be the first of many well-preserved soft rock craters on earth waiting to be revealed .

the men 's families had argued that they should have their cases heard in a us federal court because they were effectively being held on us territory at the guantanamo bay naval base in cuba .
the men 's families argued they were being held on us territory but district court judge colleen kollar-kotelly said the us legal system had no jurisdiction over the detainees at guantanamo bay .
the men - two britons , an australian and 11 kuwaitis - have been held at the us naval base , along with nearly 600 other prisoners , since last year .
prosecutors had feared that a successful lawsuit would open the way for other detainees at the base to make similar claims .
rights ' violated ' lawyers for the families of the men - shafiq rasul and asif iqbal from the uk , australian david hicks , and the kuwaitis - had argued they should have the right to know why they were being held and have access to legal counsel .
briton shafiq rasul is among those being held they also claimed they should have the same rights to the us legal system as cubans who sought political asylum in the us .
british lawyer stephen jakobi , director of fair trials abroad , predicted the men would appeal to the supreme court .
he said : " we have consistently tried to get these people out of legal limbo and into some sort of fair trial situation .
" we think it 's a disgrace to civilised society and the american government that nothing whatsoever has been done to try these people in any form of fair trial . "
the us government has refused to class the detainees as prisoners-of-war because , it says , they were not part of a recognisable military hierarchy , and therefore did not merit the rights of pows .
the families ' lawyers argued that that decision violated the us constitution 's guarantee of due process .
they said the men might be held indefinitely or could end up appearing without representation before a military tribunal , which had the power to impose the death penalty .
victory to bush rejecting the men 's case , judge kollar-kotelly said there was a " crucial distinction " between the detainees and cuban asylum seekers who had a " credible fear of political persecution " .
she also said the men might not be held indefinitely because global courts , the united nations and the men 's own governments had the power to ask the us about their fate .
however , mr jakobi said the men could spend the rest of their lives locked up without trial .
he said : " nothing has happened and they could be there for the rest of their lives .
" there will surely be an appeal to the supreme court .
" we do not deny the americans their right to try them but they need to be tried . "
the bbc 's rob watson in washington says the judge 's ruling is a major victory for the bush administration , which has been anxious to keep the detainees away from the us legal system .
there are now about 600 prisoners at guantanamo bay , none of whom has yet been charged with any crime .
