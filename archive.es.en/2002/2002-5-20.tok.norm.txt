railtrack said on saturday that the vital components in the trackwork had detached , forcing the rear carriage off the rails as the train passed over on friday .
the company responsible for maintaining the track at the scene has confirmed the points passed a safety inspection only the day before .
meanwhile , police are still trying to identity one of the dead and one of the crash survivors who is in a critical condition in hospital .
the rear carriage flipped across two platforms potters bar crash seven people died two are still critically injured investigation teams are combing the scene more images the injured woman , whose age has not been released , was taken to the royal free hospital in hampstead , north london , with head injuries .
remembrance services are being held in potters bar on sunday , after floral tributes were laid at the scene for a second night .
as work continues to clear up the crash site , investigators are to start a minute forensic examination of the failed points .
one element of the inquiry will involve looking for rust in the bolt holes in an effort to date how long they had been dislodged for .
speculation that vandals are to blame increased after the engineering firm in charge of maintenance on the east coast main line , jarvis plc , backed claims by railtrack that the points were checked on thursday .
a company statement said : " our extensive records show that all maintenance work in the area has been carried out fully in accordance with group and line standards .
vandals " this particular site was last inspected on may 9 and the points in question were compliant with standards at the time of this inspection . "
earlier john armitt , railtrack chief executive , said the points were " visually inspected " the day before and examined more thoroughly on 1 may .
he added : " we are unclear why nuts which were an integral part of the points were detached , and the investigation will look into this with great detail .
" we will not rest until we have exhausted the investigation . "
byers insists railways are still safe vandalism may have caused the damage , but experts also say the bolts could have been weakened by passing trains .
a maintenance failure could also be to blame , but a nationwide inspection of points around the network has so far revealed no similar problems .
the accident happened just before 1300 bst on friday when the rear carriage of a wagn train derailed and flipped across two platforms before wedging under the canopy of the hertfordshire station 's roof .
dead named the carriage will be removed by a special 11,000 ton crane later on sunday , and trains are being diverted via hertford .
earlier in the day , transport secretary stephen byers visited the site and moved to reassure the public that rail travel was " still one of the safest forms of transport " .
he said : " it 's very difficult in a situation like this to say that the network is safe but if you compare the network to other forms of travel it is one of the safest forms . "
railtrack boss john armitt : the crash was a " savage blow " also on saturday , prince charles visited survivors of the crash in barnet general hospital and chase farm hospital in enfield .
police have confirmed that the former head of the bbc world service , austen kark , was among the seven killed in the disaster .
eighty-year-old agnes quinlivan - a great-grandmother of two and grandmother of eight from potters bar - has also been named as being among the dead .
officers have confirmed the names of four others but are still trying to identify the seventh victim who they say is a foreign woman .
two people remain in a critical condition in hospital .

dave mill from perthshire used his sledge to mark out a 400 metre runway in the ice , and e-mailed a digital photograph to canada 's first air company in resolute bay .
mr mill set out last month on an attempt to become the first man to complete a solo and unaided walk from canada to the north pole .
however , his third attempt at the journey was scuppered by delays , leaving him trapped on an ice floe .
mr mill was stranded on an ice floe the 34-year-old , from kenmore in perthshire , was said to have a week to find ice which was solid enough to build a runway for a rescue aircraft .
his crew warned he was facing " certain death " if he did not make it in time .
during his trek mr mill experienced a close call with a polar bear - as well as receiving a telephone call from acclaimed singer-songwriter david gray .
he said that conversation had been " as inspiring as it was surprising " .
" he promised me champagne and tickets to one of his gigs .
walking to babylon " i have been listening to white ladder for weeks now - it is my only real luxury , my disc on a desert island of ice , " mr mill wrote on his website .
and referring to one of david gray 's songs , he said : " i am , literally , walking to babylon . "
mr mill told his website that he was heading north in search of a pad of ice with enough space to enable him to build a runway .
david gray spoke to the explorer " i am feeling fit and fine - but i am all too aware of just how much effort and strength it is going to take to clear the rubble fields and to build a 400 metre runway in time for the rescue aircraft .
" now is not the best time to be an unaided and un-supported explorer .
" i will need the strength of an army of navvies once i start to build - but i am feeling strong . "
mr mill told of a " brief encounter " with polar bear tracks in recent days .
but he added : " polar bears are the least of my problems right now - i am far more worried about thinning ice .
melting ice " i have made a mental note to brush up on what 's going on with global warming when i get back home .
and get back home i will . "
mr mill set off from canada at the end of march in his third attempt to complete the journey .
last year he returned home after setting a new record for walking solo and unaided towards the north pole before melting ice forced him to abandon his attempt .
mr mill was also on the back-up expedition that followed sir ranulph fiennes in 2000 when the english explorer had to abort his attempt due to frostbite .
the scottish explorer fell behind schedule on his latest expedition after experiencing a number of problems , including a broken stove .
this meant that he found himself in an area which is more prone to ice break-up as the north pole approached the longest day of the year .

trade union officials feared even this higher estimate could be too low .
" some 12,000 jobs are at risk .
the entire turin industrial system is in danger , " said giorgio airaudo , secretary of the turin branch of the fiom cgil union .
government involvement concerns about the industry wide impact of last week 's decision to cut 2,800 jobs in fiat 's italian factories have spread to government level .
last thursday , the italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said the government would consider bailing out fiat auto .
his comments came ahead of a meeting on friday between fiat 's chief executive paolo cantarella and labour minister roberto maroni .
further meetings are believed to have been scheduled for tuesday and wednesday this week .
falling sales fiat auto , which is 20 % owned by general motors and 80 % owned by the italian industrial group fiat , has been hit by falling car sales .
in its key home market , car sales fell 18 % during march and 13 % during april while the may figure is expected to record a 13-15 % fall , according to preliminary data from the automotive research organisation centro studi promotor .
during the first three months of the fiscal year , fiat auto clocked up 529m euro -lrb- £ 333m ; $ 487m -rrb- losses .
fiat auto 's head , giancarlo boschetti , on friday warned sales could " be even worse in the near future " .

the survey , part of a major bbc news online series on race relations in the uk , also indicates widespread support for plans to introduce citizenship classes and english lessons for people applying to live in the uk .
it reveals that racism in the workplace is a major problem - with almost one in three blacks and asians saying they believe racism has cost them the chance of a job .

following a trip to amsterdam , mick and pauline holcroft said they were impressed by that country 's openness about drugs and called for a massive overhaul of britain 's laws .
the couple , who published shocking photos of 21-year-old rachel 's body after she overdosed , also supported cannabis cafes for breaking the link between drug users and street dealers .
following their visit to the netherlands for an itv1 news programme the holcrofts praised the availability of immediate help in that country for those with problems and said the same approach in britain could save lives .
rachel may have lived , say her parents mrs holcroft , from withington , herefordshire , said britain should have learned from the dutch approach to drugs .
she said : " i have to think there 's a far bigger chance that rachel would still be with us .
" i 'm obviously very saddened that if rachel had had those opportunities , she may still be here . "
mr holcroft said : " i do honestly feel after talking to some of the experts and talking to heroin users , that there is a system in holland that can help the families as well , and you would not feel quite so helpless . "
' instantaneous help ' the holcrofts said heroin users at an amsterdam drop-in centre they visited were appalled by the circumstances in which rachel died .
the body of the former university student was discovered in a bedsit in exmouth , devon , three days after she overdosed in may 2000 .
she still had a syringe in her hand .
mrs holcroft said : " it was amazing meeting those people .
" when they needed help , it was more or less instantaneous .
certainly within two days , to be put on a programme to come off it .
" they ca n't believe the circumstances under which rachel died and were shocked by the photographs " education rachel 's parents , who have previously backed a campaign encouraging heroin users not to inject , said drugs education is a much higher priority in dutch schools .
in britain , you have dealers with cannabis in one pocket and heroin in the other pauline holcroft they supported the idea of teaching children as young as nine about the dangers of drug use .
job arnold from the drug user 's union in amsterdam told them : " recent history has shown holland as a country that is open about drugs and drug users , and young people can see for themselves that really a lifestyle with heroin is not a very promising option . "
despite the netherlands ' more liberal approach to drugs fewer young people use them than in britain .
' loving girl ' rachel moved on to heroin after smoking cannabis and the holcrofts believe she may never have made the jump if cannabis cafes existed in britain .
mrs holcroft said : " i think the key issues are that cannabis is kept separately to other drugs .
" in britain , you have dealers with cannabis in one pocket and heroin in the other .
" when they run out of one , they give people the other .
that 's how they get hooked on heroin . "
remembering her daughter as a " very outgoing , loving girl " and added : " we could n't help remembering rachel on our trip , and knowing that when she wanted help , it was n't there . "

they succeeded in excluding iceland which wants to join the iwc while keeping open the option of a return to commercial whaling .
-lrb- the vote -rrb- is a major setback for the pro-whalers and an unexpected margin uk fisheries minister elliot morley japan has been leading the drive for a resumption of commercial whaling , banned 15 years ago , at the meeting held in the port of shimonoseki in western japan , home to the country 's whaling fleet .
the vote over iceland 's membership was seen as a key test of sentiment as the conference got under way .
pro-whaling countries tried to overturn last year 's ruling that iceland could not join until it agreed to accept the iwc 's moratorium on commercial whaling .
pro-whaling campaigners make their case at the meeting they were defeated by 25 votes to 20 despite their optimism that this time they could muster the necessary majority .
iceland has had non-voting observer status since its delegates walked out of an iwc meeting 10 years ago to protest against the commission 's anti-whaling stance .
its return to full membership could have given the pro-whaling nations a majority .
the uk fisheries minister , elliot morley , said the result was better than expected and a very good sign , but he cautioned that anti-whaling countries could face tougher resistance on other issues .
there is a suspicion some delegates may have been confused by the hours of procedural wrangling before the vote was taken and by its wording .
stormy days ahead in the coming days , japan will seek support for an expansion of its research whaling programme which currently takes about 500 minke whales a year .
it will also seek to block proposals for new whale sanctuaries in the south pacific and south atlantic .
gray whale : subsistence whalers ' target japan says some species of whales are so abundant they are threatening fish stocks .
the united states has described the claim as false and an attempt to make the whale a scapegoat for over-fishing .
six countries have joined the organisation in recent weeks and four are thought to back japan 's position .

speaking afterwards , mr kabbah made a speech appealing for national unity in order to rebuild the west african state after 10 years of civil war .
i appeal to you whatever your party affiliation or party symbol or ideology to join me in building a new coalition for national development president ahmad tejan kabbah referring to the peaceful nature of the elections mr kabbah said that " one of the most far-reaching decisions in the country 's current history " had been made and he pledged to battle corruption and hunger , and improve human rights .
thousands of people have taken to the streets of the capital , freetown , singing and dancing in a jubilant celebration of mr kabbah 's re-election .
un assistance electoral officials said mr kabbah won 70 % of the vote , against 22 % for his nearest challenger , ernest koroma of the all people 's congress .
" i appeal to you whatever your party affiliation or party symbol or ideology to join me in building a new coalition for national development , " said mr kabbah , whose sierra leone people 's party -lrb- slpp -rrb- also won a strong majority in parliament .
kabbah campaigned as a peacemaker it is hoped the elections , held with considerable assistance from a united nations peacekeeping force , could mark the end of 10 years of conflict and signal a smooth transition from war to democracy .
sierra leone 's electoral commissioner , walter nichols , said there had been delays in getting the final results of tuesday 's elections because staff employed by the commission had " been agitating " for their pay .
it is understood that , at one point , some commission staff were prevented from leaving their offices by angry election workers .
rebels trounced the bbc 's mark doyle in sierra leone says mr kabbah successfully portrayed himself as the candidate who had brought peace to the country .
in the decade-long brutal civil war , the rebel revolutionary united front -lrb- ruf -rrb- and some other militia groups made a practice of chopping off the limbs of their opponents .
presidential results ahmad tejan kabbah : 70.6 % ernest koroma : 22.35 % alimamy pallo bangura -lrb- former rebel -rrb- : 1.7 % the ruf has now transformed itself into a political party but its candidate , alimamy pallo bangura , took only 1.7 % of the vote .
the rufp failed to take a single seat in the new parliament .
president kabbah 's party , the sierra leone peoples ' party , won 83 of the 112 seats while the former ruling all people 's congress took 27 and the remaining two went to the party of a one-time junta leader , johnny paul koroma .
' free and fair ' mr kabbah , who was a un diplomat for 20 years before going into politics , succeeded in encouraging a un peacekeeping force to intervene in 1999 and also won strong military backing from the former colonial power , britain .
our correspondent says the british intervention was hugely popular with sierra leoneans , and this may have helped mr kabbah to electoral victory .
international observers have endorsed the election in sierra leone as largely free and fair .
observers from the commonwealth , european union and the united states carter center said that , although there were logistical problems , these were not enough to affect the overall result . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's sanjay dasgupta " people danced in the streets " the bbc 's mark doyle reports from freetown " the weekend street parties only stopped when a tropical storm broke " ballots not bullets campaign diary boom town voting for ex-rebels confident of victory violence breaks out ' competing as friends ' peaceful poll voting in pictures quiet , busy day expectant electors background comeback king kabbah vying for office memories of war instead of diamonds timeline country profile forum your questions see also : 16 may 02 -pipe- africa president ahead in sierra leone poll 14 may 02 -pipe- africa sierra leone voting ends 11 may 02 -pipe- africa s leone campaign ends in riots 10 may 02 -pipe- africa sierra leone troops vote early 28 mar 02 -pipe- africa sankoh barred from poll 14 may 02 -pipe- africa picture gallery : sierra leone votes 20 may 02 -pipe- africa sierra leone 's next steps internet links : sierra leone web un mission in sierra leone apc rufp slpp the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top africa stories now : ebola outbreak confirmed in congo malawi minister reveals aids trauma kenyan president opens parliament dr congo rebels go on trial nigerian id scheme kicks off tunisian internet crackdown wild pigs threaten somali peace talks anti-french protests in ivory coast links to more africa stories are at the foot of the page .

bbc northern ireland 's chief security correspondent brian rowan has been studying their form .
hugh orde he is policing 's marathon man - a five times runner in the london event with a best time of 3 hours 32 minutes for the 26 miles 385 yards .
and for each mile of that marathon distance , hugh orde , has almost completed a year of policing service .
he joined the ' met ' 25 years ago when he was in his late teens and at 43 , has now climbed to the rank of deputy assistant commissioner .
for the past two and a half years he has been travelling to northern ireland as head of the outside police team investigating the murder of the belfast solicitor pat finucane and probing allegations of security force collusion .
the report of the stevens team investigating the killing is due soon and one source has suggested it will be " patten with attitude " - a reference to the controversial report on police reform .
orde 's investigation has given him a close-up look at the most controversial aspects of policing here .
he has been examining how the special branch functioned .
his findings , which will be written into the report of the metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens , will add to the debate on the future of the " force within a force " as special branch has come to be described .
alan mcquillan he joined the ruc in 1976 as the first graduate entrant under the accelerated promotion scheme .
he rose quickly through the ranks to become a superintendent in 1990 .
he left the ruc in 1995 to become assistant chief constable in the gwent constabulary in wales before returning three years later at the same rank .
mcquillan is currently the operational police commander in belfast and is probably the best known of the three contenders .
the holy cross girls ' school protest and the street violence in north belfast have regularly put him onto television screens over the past year .
chris albiston chris albiston has recently taken charge of the psni 's special branch and criminal investigation department .
he is a modern history graduate of exeter college , oxford , who joined the metropolitan police in 1975 .
albiston transferred to the ruc in 1989 and was appointed deputy sub-divisional commander in lisburn .
he progressed through the ranks until he became an assistant chief constable in may 1998 when he took over responsibility for management support .
in january 2001 , albiston took on a high-profile role when he served as police commissioner with the united nations mission in kosovo .
during his year there he was responsible for leading the 8,000-strong force of international and local officers who policed the troubled balkan region .
the ruc sent 60 officers .
interviews are scheduled for 29 may and eight members of the board will decide who should succeed sir ronnie flanagan .
they are the chairman and the vice chair professor desmond rea and denis bradley ; three politicians joe byrne -lrb- sdlp -rrb- , fred cobain -lrb- ulster unionist -rrb- and sammy wilson -lrb- dup -rrb- ; and three independents , pauline mccabe , suneil sharma and barry gilligan .
their choice has to be endorsed by northern ireland secretary john reid .
the province 's acting chief constable , colin cramphorn , has not applied .
he is looking for a job elsewhere and has recently been interviewed for six chief constable posts in england and scotland without success .
fermanagh woman maria wallis , who was being talked about as one of the favourites to succeed sir ronnie flanagan , withdrew from the race in northern ireland after her recent appointment to the chief constable post in devon and cornwall .
' charismatic ' but no-one is calling the result in this contest which is being characterised as a race to the line .
one policing board source told bbc news online : " whoever gets it has to be charismatic enough to lead the organisation through the change .
" he has to give some confidence to ordinary people that the increase in crime - burglaries , car crime , drugs - will be seriously addressed .
" people in the community are beginning to lose confidence in the police . "
another board source summed up the contest : " all three can have no illusions given their working knowledge of policing -lrb- in northern ireland -rrb- - no illusions about the range of change and the issues , past and future , that need to be tackled .
" it 's a genuine three horse race and it could be a photo finish . "
who then will get their chest through the line first ?
we will know soon .
the board hopes to announce its " winner " next month .

the us series starring calista flockhart was axed after ratings went into freefall .
the last show saw many friends and lovers from ally 's past return for a grand finale .
the thirtysomething comedy became a huge success when it first launched , becoming a new breed of watercooler tv - a show which elicits much conversation between fans .
but after the lead character suffered one broken heart after another those committed viewers began to ebb away .
the show 's creator , david e kelley , drafted in a host of famous faces to breath new life into the show including rock singer jon bon jovi , friends ' star matthew perry and barry humphries of dame edna everage fame .
ally mcbeal was portrayed as a needy woman who struggled to juggle her career and a love life - something which did not endear her to feminists .
dancing baby the show won two golden globes and an emmy for best comedy .
fantasy sequences , a dancing baby , bizarre legal cases and an eccentric lead character all went into making ally mcbeal one of the surprise hits of the late 90s .
guest appearances over the years have included mariah carey , sting , barry manilow and barry white .
but critics considered the format had become tired and despite the introduction of new characters there was to be no resurgence of the mcbeal phenomenon .
one of the biggest disappointments for fans was the loss of actor robert downey jr , who played ally 's boyfriend larry .
although a popular character , producers despaired of downey jr 's off camera turmoil and his battle with drugs and finally wrote him out of the show .
kelley blamed the downturn in viewing figures on the difficulty of keeping the format new and exciting .
" there are only so many stories like this you can do , " he said .
" we 've moved sexual harassment law probably beyond where the law is at this point . "
british fans can see the final episode on e4 on 9 july , and on channel 4 later in the year .

the us series starring calista flockhart was axed after ratings went into freefall .
the last show saw many friends and lovers from ally 's past return for a grand finale .
the thirtysomething comedy became a huge success when it first launched , becoming a new breed of watercooler tv - a show which elicits much conversation between fans .
robert downey jr was a big hit when he joined the cast but after the lead character suffered one broken heart after another those committed viewers began to ebb away .
the show 's creator , david e kelley , drafted in a host of famous faces to breath new life into the show including rock singer jon bon jovi , friends ' star matthew perry and barry humphries of dame edna everage fame .
ally mcbeal was portrayed as a needy woman who struggled to juggle her career and a love life - something which did not endear her to feminists .
dancing baby the show won two golden globes and an emmy for best comedy .
fantasy sequences , a dancing baby , bizarre legal cases and an eccentric lead character all went into making ally mcbeal one of the surprise hits of the late 90s .
guest appearances over the years have included mariah carey , sting , barry manilow and barry white .
but critics considered the format had become tired and despite the introduction of new characters there was to be no resurgence of the mcbeal phenomenon .
jon bon jovi has played mcbeal 's love interest one of the biggest disappointments for fans was the loss of actor robert downey jr , who played ally 's boyfriend larry .
although a popular character , producers despaired of downey jr 's off camera turmoil and his battle with drugs and finally wrote him out of the show .
kelley blamed the downturn in viewing figures on the difficulty of keeping the format new and exciting .
" there are only so many stories like this you can do , " he said .
" we 've moved sexual harassment law probably beyond where the law is at this point . "
british fans can see the final episode on e4 on 9 july , and on channel 4 later in the year .
