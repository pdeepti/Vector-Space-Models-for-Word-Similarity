the skies over europe are in danger of future accidents unless co-operation and compatability can be secured between contradicting air traffic control centres across the continent . in the wake of the recent german air disaster , the on-going dissection of evidence and proportioning of blame highlights the rifts and inadequecies of air traffic control systems in charge of european skies .
investigations have shown that as well as receiving contradictory instructions just before the crash , the russian pilot may have been flying by rules different from those followed in the rest of europe .
contradictions in flight rules put passengers at risk a lethal grey area has emerged in the aftermath of last week 's mid-air collision over lake constance in germany .
evidence has surfaced that suggests that both pilots were acting in a way they had been told was correct .
european officials insist that international rules oblige pilots to follow the orders of their onboard systems , the aircraft collision avoidance system -lrb- acas -rrb- , and ignore conflicting advice from air traffic control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : control center of the swiss air traffic control skyguide .
but russian officials this week insisted that their pilots were expected to consider both the orders of air traffic control and onboard systems , before making their own decision .
a directive set out in an international civilian aviation organisation -lrb- icao -rrb- document stipulates that in the event of a clash between the instruction given by air traffic control and a high-level alert from the onboard acas system - known as a resolution advisory - ' the pilot should follow the resolution advisory ' .
" the performance-based training objectives were sent out to all states by an icao state letter in 1997 .
the russians will have received the icao guidance , " said john law , the project manager for the acas system at the european air traffic control centre , eurocontrol .
but his version of the rules was challenged by yuri tarshin , the head of the department of aviation standards at the russian ministry of transport .
" russian aviation companies who fly in europe do so under european rules , " mr tarshin said .
" in european rules for training of pilots , you can find nowhere where it says what is the priority.the decision is up to the main pilot .
he has to take into account all the information , particularly when there is a resolution advisory . "
" we follow the european standards of the countries in whose airspace we fly .
if we had a document saying that the pilot should , in any case , obey the signals of the acas , then we would follow it .
but that document does not exist . "
mep 's bid to consolidate european airspace plans these revelations come in the same week that european parliament ministers met to discuss plans for making incompatible air traffic control systems communicate with each other , creating a single view of european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single european sky may help to avoid inconsistencies in policy .
the single european sky project is designed to improve air safety , reduce costs and minimise delays by ensuring consistent operating practices between the 64 different national air traffic control centres across the continent by using a new satellite-based air traffic management system that will carry the seamless exchange of flight information .
the plans will be in place by 2004 , but no deadline for implementation has been set .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2002 over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compensation for holocaust survivors and former forced labourers has become an important international topic a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- have been paid to 817,000 claimants world-wide , a representative told dw-world . mr kai henning , of the german foundation , " remembering , responsibility and future " can hardly keep the pride out of his voice .
taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .
tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .
slow but reliable kai henning also believes that general public reaction in germany towards the work done by the foundation has been largely positive .
" we ’ ve received over 10 million euro -lrb- $ 9.88 million -rrb- from private individuals in germany alone " , he says .
to frequent criticism of the foundation working too slowly , henning says , " people say that we should work quickly , but at the same time we have to be careful .
we need to verify claims thoroughly , or we ’ d be accused of squandering money on false claims .
we need to find a good balance " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2002 hiv-positive character to join muppets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with muppets like these , who needs teachers ?
five-year-olds could soon be able to teach their parents a thing or two about aids .
an hiv-positive character will soon join the cast of the long-running children ’ s program sesame street . in one of the more unusual statements to come out of the fourteenth international conference on aids in barcelona , which ended on friday , the vice-president of sesame workshop , joel schneider , announced that a character would be introduced in its south african program later in the year who will be hiv positive .
any colour , as long as it ’ s female schneider said the south african character hadn ’ t been named or designed yet , but it was likely to be a five-year-old girl .
" she ’ ll be lively , alert , friendly , outgoing and hiv-positive , " schneider said on thursday in barcelona .
" she will have high self-esteem .
women are often stigamised about hiv and we are providing a good role model as to how to deal with one ’ s situation and how to interact with the community . "
schneider says this is the main aim of having an hiv positive member on the famous muppet team .
he hopes that it will encourage " model positive behaviour " towards people with hiv and aids among viewers of the program , who are mostly between three and seven years old .
" we want to show children that it ’ s okay to touch , okay to hug , that a person can still be a constructive part of the community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the cast of sesame street surround un secretary general kofi annan in new york .
-lrb- ap photo / marty lederhandler -rrb- " appropriate " not every takalani sesame show -lrb- takalani means ‘ be happy ’ in the tshivenda language -rrb- will deal explicitly with hiv / aids .
the hiv-positive character ’ s real world contemporaries who watch the program will not be seeing explicit sex or intravenous drug use .
instead the messages will be appropriate , schneider says .
" what do i do when i cut my finger ?
what do i do when i cut your finger ?
that sort of thing . "
spokesperson for the sesame street workshop in new york beatrice chow says takalani sesame will be the first show of its kind designed for pre-schoolers .
south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .
while adolescence is the time when most people become sexually active , a un study released this month has found that most young people between 15 and 24 have no idea how hiv is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .
young women are consistently found to have higher rates of infection than men in the same age group .
the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .
at the close of the conference , mandela gave a speech in which he referred to his long struggle against apartheid " often against odds that were considered insurmountable " .
a chilling reminder the six-day conference in barcelona attended by 15,000 health professionals and ngos was the biggest ever international gathering on hiv / aids .
unaids said the conference made progress towards finding a solution to the pandemic .
but aids campaigners said the meeting was a chilling reminder of the work still to be done .
they lamented that there was no cure or vaccine for the disease .
some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .
according to unaids , about 20 million people have died of aids since the disease was first detected more than twenty years ago in san francisco .
forty million people are currently infected with the human immune deficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- .
more than sixty million people are expected to die of aids by 2020 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links unaids barcelona conference the homepage of the xiv international conference on aids unicef aids information the kaiser network special coverage of the xiv international aids conference world health organisation the who homepage 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2002 over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compensation for holocaust survivors and former forced labourers has become an important international topic a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- have been paid to 817,000 claimants world-wide , a representative told dw-world . mr kai henning , of the german foundation , " remembering , responsibility and future " can hardly keep the pride out of his voice .
taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .
tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .
slow but reliable kai henning also believes that general public reaction in germany towards the work done by the foundation has been largely positive .
" we ’ ve received over 10 million euro -lrb- $ 9.88 million -rrb- from private individuals in germany alone " , he says .
to frequent criticism of the foundation working too slowly , henning says , " people say that we should work quickly , but at the same time we have to be careful .
we need to verify claims thoroughly , or we ’ d be accused of squandering money on false claims .
we need to find a good balance " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

five-year-olds could soon be able to teach their parents a thing or two about aids .
an hiv-positive character will soon join the cast of the long-running children ’ s program sesame street . in one of the more unusual statements to come out of the fourteenth international conference on aids in barcelona , which ended on friday , the vice-president of sesame workshop , joel schneider , announced that a character would be introduced in its south african program later in the year who will be hiv positive .
any colour , as long as it ’ s female schneider said the south african character hadn ’ t been named or designed yet , but it was likely to be a five-year-old girl .
" she ’ ll be lively , alert , friendly , outgoing and hiv-positive , " schneider said on thursday in barcelona .
" she will have high self-esteem .
women are often stigamised about hiv and we are providing a good role model as to how to deal with one ’ s situation and how to interact with the community . "
schneider says this is the main aim of having an hiv positive member on the famous muppet team .
he hopes that it will encourage " model positive behaviour " towards people with hiv and aids among viewers of the program , who are mostly between three and seven years old .
" we want to show children that it ’ s okay to touch , okay to hug , that a person can still be a constructive part of the community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the cast of sesame street surround un secretary general kofi annan in new york .
-lrb- ap photo / marty lederhandler -rrb- " appropriate " not every takalani sesame show -lrb- takalani means ‘ be happy ’ in the tshivenda language -rrb- will deal explicitly with hiv / aids .
the hiv-positive character ’ s real world contemporaries who watch the program will not be seeing explicit sex or intravenous drug use .
instead the messages will be appropriate , schneider says .
" what do i do when i cut my finger ?
what do i do when i cut your finger ?
that sort of thing . "
spokesperson for the sesame street workshop in new york beatrice chow says takalani sesame will be the first show of its kind designed for pre-schoolers .
south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .
while adolescence is the time when most people become sexually active , a un study released this month has found that most young people between 15 and 24 have no idea how hiv is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .
young women are consistently found to have higher rates of infection than men in the same age group .
the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .
at the close of the conference , mandela gave a speech in which he referred to his long struggle against apartheid " often against odds that were considered insurmountable " .
a chilling reminder the six-day conference in barcelona attended by 15,000 health professionals and ngos was the biggest ever international gathering on hiv / aids .
unaids said the conference made progress towards finding a solution to the pandemic .
but aids campaigners said the meeting was a chilling reminder of the work still to be done .
they lamented that there was no cure or vaccine for the disease .
some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .
according to unaids , about 20 million people have died of aids since the disease was first detected more than twenty years ago in san francisco .
forty million people are currently infected with the human immune deficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- .
more than sixty million people are expected to die of aids by 2020 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links unaids barcelona conference the homepage of the xiv international conference on aids unicef aids information the kaiser network special coverage of the xiv international aids conference world health organisation the who homepage 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.07.2002 air traffic review exposes fatal flaws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an overhaul of european air traffic control systems is necessary to avoid further disasters .
the skies over europe are in danger of future accidents unless co-operation and compatability can be secured between contradicting air traffic control centres across the continent . in the wake of the recent german air disaster , the on-going dissection of evidence and proportioning of blame highlights the rifts and inadequecies of air traffic control systems in charge of european skies .
investigations have shown that as well as receiving contradictory instructions just before the crash , the russian pilot may have been flying by rules different from those followed in the rest of europe .
contradictions in flight rules put passengers at risk a lethal grey area has emerged in the aftermath of last week 's mid-air collision over lake constance in germany .
evidence has surfaced that suggests that both pilots were acting in a way they had been told was correct .
european officials insist that international rules oblige pilots to follow the orders of their onboard systems , the aircraft collision avoidance system -lrb- acas -rrb- , and ignore conflicting advice from air traffic control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : control center of the swiss air traffic control skyguide .
but russian officials this week insisted that their pilots were expected to consider both the orders of air traffic control and onboard systems , before making their own decision .
a directive set out in an international civilian aviation organisation -lrb- icao -rrb- document stipulates that in the event of a clash between the instruction given by air traffic control and a high-level alert from the onboard acas system - known as a resolution advisory - ' the pilot should follow the resolution advisory ' .
" the performance-based training objectives were sent out to all states by an icao state letter in 1997 .
the russians will have received the icao guidance , " said john law , the project manager for the acas system at the european air traffic control centre , eurocontrol .
but his version of the rules was challenged by yuri tarshin , the head of the department of aviation standards at the russian ministry of transport .
" russian aviation companies who fly in europe do so under european rules , " mr tarshin said .
" in european rules for training of pilots , you can find nowhere where it says what is the priority.the decision is up to the main pilot .
he has to take into account all the information , particularly when there is a resolution advisory . "
" we follow the european standards of the countries in whose airspace we fly .
if we had a document saying that the pilot should , in any case , obey the signals of the acas , then we would follow it .
but that document does not exist . "
mep 's bid to consolidate european airspace plans these revelations come in the same week that european parliament ministers met to discuss plans for making incompatible air traffic control systems communicate with each other , creating a single view of european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single european sky may help to avoid inconsistencies in policy .
the single european sky project is designed to improve air safety , reduce costs and minimise delays by ensuring consistent operating practices between the 64 different national air traffic control centres across the continent by using a new satellite-based air traffic management system that will carry the seamless exchange of flight information .
the plans will be in place by 2004 , but no deadline for implementation has been set .
' outdated ' european air control in need of reform ' the proposal for a single european sky is an ambitious attempt to reform the outdated architecture of european air traffic control .
it comes at a time when new positioning and communication technologies offer opportunities for significant improvements in the efficiency and safety of air travel , ' said loyola de palacio , european commissioner for energy and transport .
eurocontrol , the european air safety organisation , has been working with the ec to define systems and architectural guidelines , and will play a vital role in enforcing the initiative .
all european air traffic controllers will have to ensure compliance .
in the meantime , air travel safety will remain a lottery . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators seek answers to crash investigators near lake constance try to find answers to germany 's worst plane crash in nearly 30 years .

the skies over europe are in danger of future accidents unless co-operation and compatability can be secured between contradicting air traffic control centres across the continent . in the wake of the recent german air disaster , the on-going dissection of evidence and proportioning of blame highlights the rifts and inadequecies of air traffic control systems in charge of european skies .
investigations have shown that as well as receiving contradictory instructions just before the crash , the russian pilot may have been flying by rules different from those followed in the rest of europe .
contradictions in flight rules put passengers at risk a lethal grey area has emerged in the aftermath of last week 's mid-air collision over lake constance in germany .
evidence has surfaced that suggests that both pilots were acting in a way they had been told was correct .
european officials insist that international rules oblige pilots to follow the orders of their onboard systems , the aircraft collision avoidance system -lrb- acas -rrb- , and ignore conflicting advice from air traffic control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : control center of the swiss air traffic control skyguide .
but russian officials this week insisted that their pilots were expected to consider both the orders of air traffic control and onboard systems , before making their own decision .
a directive set out in an international civilian aviation organisation -lrb- icao -rrb- document stipulates that in the event of a clash between the instruction given by air traffic control and a high-level alert from the onboard acas system - known as a resolution advisory - ' the pilot should follow the resolution advisory ' .
" the performance-based training objectives were sent out to all states by an icao state letter in 1997 .
the russians will have received the icao guidance , " said john law , the project manager for the acas system at the european air traffic control centre , eurocontrol .
but his version of the rules was challenged by yuri tarshin , the head of the department of aviation standards at the russian ministry of transport .
" russian aviation companies who fly in europe do so under european rules , " mr tarshin said .
" in european rules for training of pilots , you can find nowhere where it says what is the priority.the decision is up to the main pilot .
he has to take into account all the information , particularly when there is a resolution advisory . "
" we follow the european standards of the countries in whose airspace we fly .
if we had a document saying that the pilot should , in any case , obey the signals of the acas , then we would follow it .
but that document does not exist . "
mep 's bid to consolidate european airspace plans these revelations come in the same week that european parliament ministers met to discuss plans for making incompatible air traffic control systems communicate with each other , creating a single view of european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single european sky may help to avoid inconsistencies in policy .
the single european sky project is designed to improve air safety , reduce costs and minimise delays by ensuring consistent operating practices between the 64 different national air traffic control centres across the continent by using a new satellite-based air traffic management system that will carry the seamless exchange of flight information .
the plans will be in place by 2004 , but no deadline for implementation has been set .
' outdated ' european air control in need of reform ' the proposal for a single european sky is an ambitious attempt to reform the outdated architecture of european air traffic control .
it comes at a time when new positioning and communication technologies offer opportunities for significant improvements in the efficiency and safety of air travel , ' said loyola de palacio , european commissioner for energy and transport .
eurocontrol , the european air safety organisation , has been working with the ec to define systems and architectural guidelines , and will play a vital role in enforcing the initiative .

five-year-olds could soon be able to teach their parents a thing or two about aids .
an hiv-positive character will soon join the cast of the long-running children ’ s program sesame street . in one of the more unusual statements to come out of the fourteenth international conference on aids in barcelona , which ended on friday , the vice-president of sesame workshop , joel schneider , announced that a character would be introduced in its south african program later in the year who will be hiv positive .
any colour , as long as it ’ s female schneider said the south african character hadn ’ t been named or designed yet , but it was likely to be a five-year-old girl .
" she ’ ll be lively , alert , friendly , outgoing and hiv-positive , " schneider said on thursday in barcelona .
" she will have high self-esteem .
women are often stigamised about hiv and we are providing a good role model as to how to deal with one ’ s situation and how to interact with the community . "
schneider says this is the main aim of having an hiv positive member on the famous muppet team .
he hopes that it will encourage " model positive behaviour " towards people with hiv and aids among viewers of the program , who are mostly between three and seven years old .
" we want to show children that it ’ s okay to touch , okay to hug , that a person can still be a constructive part of the community . "

instead the messages will be appropriate , schneider says .
" what do i do when i cut my finger ?
what do i do when i cut your finger ?
that sort of thing . "
spokesperson for the sesame street workshop in new york beatrice chow says takalani sesame will be the first show of its kind designed for pre-schoolers .
south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .
while adolescence is the time when most people become sexually active , a un study released this month has found that most young people between 15 and 24 have no idea how hiv is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .
young women are consistently found to have higher rates of infection than men in the same age group .
the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .
at the close of the conference , mandela gave a speech in which he referred to his long struggle against apartheid " often against odds that were considered insurmountable " .
a chilling reminder the six-day conference in barcelona attended by 15,000 health professionals and ngos was the biggest ever international gathering on hiv / aids .
unaids said the conference made progress towards finding a solution to the pandemic .
but aids campaigners said the meeting was a chilling reminder of the work still to be done .
they lamented that there was no cure or vaccine for the disease .
some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .
according to unaids , about 20 million people have died of aids since the disease was first detected more than twenty years ago in san francisco .
forty million people are currently infected with the human immune deficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2002 over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compensation for holocaust survivors and former forced labourers has become an important international topic a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- have been paid to 817,000 claimants world-wide , a representative told dw-world . mr kai henning , of the german foundation , " remembering , responsibility and future " can hardly keep the pride out of his voice .
taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .
tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .
slow but reliable kai henning also believes that general public reaction in germany towards the work done by the foundation has been largely positive .
" we ’ ve received over 10 million euro -lrb- $ 9.88 million -rrb- from private individuals in germany alone " , he says .
to frequent criticism of the foundation working too slowly , henning says , " people say that we should work quickly , but at the same time we have to be careful .
we need to verify claims thoroughly , or we ’ d be accused of squandering money on false claims .
we need to find a good balance " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the skies over europe are in danger of future accidents unless co-operation and compatability can be secured between contradicting air traffic control centres across the continent . in the wake of the recent german air disaster , the on-going dissection of evidence and proportioning of blame highlights the rifts and inadequecies of air traffic control systems in charge of european skies .
investigations have shown that as well as receiving contradictory instructions just before the crash , the russian pilot may have been flying by rules different from those followed in the rest of europe .
contradictions in flight rules put passengers at risk a lethal grey area has emerged in the aftermath of last week 's mid-air collision over lake constance in germany .
evidence has surfaced that suggests that both pilots were acting in a way they had been told was correct .
european officials insist that international rules oblige pilots to follow the orders of their onboard systems , the aircraft collision avoidance system -lrb- acas -rrb- , and ignore conflicting advice from air traffic control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : control center of the swiss air traffic control skyguide .
but russian officials this week insisted that their pilots were expected to consider both the orders of air traffic control and onboard systems , before making their own decision .
a directive set out in an international civilian aviation organisation -lrb- icao -rrb- document stipulates that in the event of a clash between the instruction given by air traffic control and a high-level alert from the onboard acas system - known as a resolution advisory - ' the pilot should follow the resolution advisory ' .
" the performance-based training objectives were sent out to all states by an icao state letter in 1997 .
the russians will have received the icao guidance , " said john law , the project manager for the acas system at the european air traffic control centre , eurocontrol .
but his version of the rules was challenged by yuri tarshin , the head of the department of aviation standards at the russian ministry of transport .
" russian aviation companies who fly in europe do so under european rules , " mr tarshin said .
" in european rules for training of pilots , you can find nowhere where it says what is the priority.the decision is up to the main pilot .
he has to take into account all the information , particularly when there is a resolution advisory . "
" we follow the european standards of the countries in whose airspace we fly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2002 over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compensation for holocaust survivors and former forced labourers has become an important international topic a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- have been paid to 817,000 claimants world-wide , a representative told dw-world . mr kai henning , of the german foundation , " remembering , responsibility and future " can hardly keep the pride out of his voice .
taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .
tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .
slow but reliable kai henning also believes that general public reaction in germany towards the work done by the foundation has been largely positive .
" we ’ ve received over 10 million euro -lrb- $ 9.88 million -rrb- from private individuals in germany alone " , he says .
to frequent criticism of the foundation working too slowly , henning says , " people say that we should work quickly , but at the same time we have to be careful .
we need to verify claims thoroughly , or we ’ d be accused of squandering money on false claims .
we need to find a good balance " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2002 over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compensation for holocaust survivors and former forced labourers has become an important international topic a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- have been paid to 817,000 claimants world-wide , a representative told dw-world . mr kai henning , of the german foundation , " remembering , responsibility and future " can hardly keep the pride out of his voice .
taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .
tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .
slow but reliable kai henning also believes that general public reaction in germany towards the work done by the foundation has been largely positive .
" we ’ ve received over 10 million euro -lrb- $ 9.88 million -rrb- from private individuals in germany alone " , he says .
to frequent criticism of the foundation working too slowly , henning says , " people say that we should work quickly , but at the same time we have to be careful .
we need to verify claims thoroughly , or we ’ d be accused of squandering money on false claims .
we need to find a good balance " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .

tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .

taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.07.2002 air traffic review exposes fatal flaws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an overhaul of european air traffic control systems is necessary to avoid further disasters .
the skies over europe are in danger of future accidents unless co-operation and compatability can be secured between contradicting air traffic control centres across the continent . in the wake of the recent german air disaster , the on-going dissection of evidence and proportioning of blame highlights the rifts and inadequecies of air traffic control systems in charge of european skies .
investigations have shown that as well as receiving contradictory instructions just before the crash , the russian pilot may have been flying by rules different from those followed in the rest of europe .
contradictions in flight rules put passengers at risk a lethal grey area has emerged in the aftermath of last week 's mid-air collision over lake constance in germany .
evidence has surfaced that suggests that both pilots were acting in a way they had been told was correct .
european officials insist that international rules oblige pilots to follow the orders of their onboard systems , the aircraft collision avoidance system -lrb- acas -rrb- , and ignore conflicting advice from air traffic control .

but russian officials this week insisted that their pilots were expected to consider both the orders of air traffic control and onboard systems , before making their own decision .
a directive set out in an international civilian aviation organisation -lrb- icao -rrb- document stipulates that in the event of a clash between the instruction given by air traffic control and a high-level alert from the onboard acas system - known as a resolution advisory - ' the pilot should follow the resolution advisory ' .
" the performance-based training objectives were sent out to all states by an icao state letter in 1997 .
the russians will have received the icao guidance , " said john law , the project manager for the acas system at the european air traffic control centre , eurocontrol .
but his version of the rules was challenged by yuri tarshin , the head of the department of aviation standards at the russian ministry of transport .
" russian aviation companies who fly in europe do so under european rules , " mr tarshin said .
" in european rules for training of pilots , you can find nowhere where it says what is the priority.the decision is up to the main pilot .
he has to take into account all the information , particularly when there is a resolution advisory . "
" we follow the european standards of the countries in whose airspace we fly .
if we had a document saying that the pilot should , in any case , obey the signals of the acas , then we would follow it .
but that document does not exist . "
mep 's bid to consolidate european airspace plans these revelations come in the same week that european parliament ministers met to discuss plans for making incompatible air traffic control systems communicate with each other , creating a single view of european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single european sky may help to avoid inconsistencies in policy .
the single european sky project is designed to improve air safety , reduce costs and minimise delays by ensuring consistent operating practices between the 64 different national air traffic control centres across the continent by using a new satellite-based air traffic management system that will carry the seamless exchange of flight information .
the plans will be in place by 2004 , but no deadline for implementation has been set .
' outdated ' european air control in need of reform ' the proposal for a single european sky is an ambitious attempt to reform the outdated architecture of european air traffic control .
it comes at a time when new positioning and communication technologies offer opportunities for significant improvements in the efficiency and safety of air travel , ' said loyola de palacio , european commissioner for energy and transport .
eurocontrol , the european air safety organisation , has been working with the ec to define systems and architectural guidelines , and will play a vital role in enforcing the initiative .
all european air traffic controllers will have to ensure compliance .
in the meantime , air travel safety will remain a lottery . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators seek answers to crash investigators near lake constance try to find answers to germany 's worst plane crash in nearly 30 years .

five-year-olds could soon be able to teach their parents a thing or two about aids .
an hiv-positive character will soon join the cast of the long-running children ’ s program sesame street . in one of the more unusual statements to come out of the fourteenth international conference on aids in barcelona , which ended on friday , the vice-president of sesame workshop , joel schneider , announced that a character would be introduced in its south african program later in the year who will be hiv positive .

schneider says this is the main aim of having an hiv positive member on the famous muppet team .
he hopes that it will encourage " model positive behaviour " towards people with hiv and aids among viewers of the program , who are mostly between three and seven years old .

south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .

south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .

the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .

some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .

spokesperson for the sesame street workshop in new york beatrice chow says takalani sesame will be the first show of its kind designed for pre-schoolers .
south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .
while adolescence is the time when most people become sexually active , a un study released this month has found that most young people between 15 and 24 have no idea how hiv is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .
young women are consistently found to have higher rates of infection than men in the same age group .
the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .
at the close of the conference , mandela gave a speech in which he referred to his long struggle against apartheid " often against odds that were considered insurmountable " .
a chilling reminder the six-day conference in barcelona attended by 15,000 health professionals and ngos was the biggest ever international gathering on hiv / aids .
unaids said the conference made progress towards finding a solution to the pandemic .
but aids campaigners said the meeting was a chilling reminder of the work still to be done .
they lamented that there was no cure or vaccine for the disease .
some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .
according to unaids , about 20 million people have died of aids since the disease was first detected more than twenty years ago in san francisco .
forty million people are currently infected with the human immune deficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- .
more than sixty million people are expected to die of aids by 2020 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links unaids barcelona conference the homepage of the xiv international conference on aids unicef aids information the kaiser network special coverage of the xiv international aids conference world health organisation the who homepage 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .
tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .
slow but reliable kai henning also believes that general public reaction in germany towards the work done by the foundation has been largely positive .
" we ’ ve received over 10 million euro -lrb- $ 9.88 million -rrb- from private individuals in germany alone " , he says .
to frequent criticism of the foundation working too slowly , henning says , " people say that we should work quickly , but at the same time we have to be careful .
we need to verify claims thoroughly , or we ’ d be accused of squandering money on false claims .
we need to find a good balance " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the skies over europe are in danger of future accidents unless co-operation and compatability can be secured between contradicting air traffic control centres across the continent . in the wake of the recent german air disaster , the on-going dissection of evidence and proportioning of blame highlights the rifts and inadequecies of air traffic control systems in charge of european skies .
investigations have shown that as well as receiving contradictory instructions just before the crash , the russian pilot may have been flying by rules different from those followed in the rest of europe .
contradictions in flight rules put passengers at risk a lethal grey area has emerged in the aftermath of last week 's mid-air collision over lake constance in germany .
evidence has surfaced that suggests that both pilots were acting in a way they had been told was correct .
european officials insist that international rules oblige pilots to follow the orders of their onboard systems , the aircraft collision avoidance system -lrb- acas -rrb- , and ignore conflicting advice from air traffic control .

a directive set out in an international civilian aviation organisation -lrb- icao -rrb- document stipulates that in the event of a clash between the instruction given by air traffic control and a high-level alert from the onboard acas system - known as a resolution advisory - ' the pilot should follow the resolution advisory ' .
" the performance-based training objectives were sent out to all states by an icao state letter in 1997 .
the russians will have received the icao guidance , " said john law , the project manager for the acas system at the european air traffic control centre , eurocontrol .
but his version of the rules was challenged by yuri tarshin , the head of the department of aviation standards at the russian ministry of transport .
" russian aviation companies who fly in europe do so under european rules , " mr tarshin said .
" in european rules for training of pilots , you can find nowhere where it says what is the priority.the decision is up to the main pilot .
he has to take into account all the information , particularly when there is a resolution advisory . "
" we follow the european standards of the countries in whose airspace we fly .
if we had a document saying that the pilot should , in any case , obey the signals of the acas , then we would follow it .
but that document does not exist . "

the single european sky project is designed to improve air safety , reduce costs and minimise delays by ensuring consistent operating practices between the 64 different national air traffic control centres across the continent by using a new satellite-based air traffic management system that will carry the seamless exchange of flight information .
the plans will be in place by 2004 , but no deadline for implementation has been set .

taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 12.07.2002 air traffic review exposes fatal flaws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an overhaul of european air traffic control systems is necessary to avoid further disasters .
the skies over europe are in danger of future accidents unless co-operation and compatability can be secured between contradicting air traffic control centres across the continent . in the wake of the recent german air disaster , the on-going dissection of evidence and proportioning of blame highlights the rifts and inadequecies of air traffic control systems in charge of european skies .
investigations have shown that as well as receiving contradictory instructions just before the crash , the russian pilot may have been flying by rules different from those followed in the rest of europe .
contradictions in flight rules put passengers at risk a lethal grey area has emerged in the aftermath of last week 's mid-air collision over lake constance in germany .
evidence has surfaced that suggests that both pilots were acting in a way they had been told was correct .
european officials insist that international rules oblige pilots to follow the orders of their onboard systems , the aircraft collision avoidance system -lrb- acas -rrb- , and ignore conflicting advice from air traffic control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : control center of the swiss air traffic control skyguide .
but russian officials this week insisted that their pilots were expected to consider both the orders of air traffic control and onboard systems , before making their own decision .
a directive set out in an international civilian aviation organisation -lrb- icao -rrb- document stipulates that in the event of a clash between the instruction given by air traffic control and a high-level alert from the onboard acas system - known as a resolution advisory - ' the pilot should follow the resolution advisory ' .
" the performance-based training objectives were sent out to all states by an icao state letter in 1997 .
the russians will have received the icao guidance , " said john law , the project manager for the acas system at the european air traffic control centre , eurocontrol .

five-year-olds could soon be able to teach their parents a thing or two about aids .
an hiv-positive character will soon join the cast of the long-running children ’ s program sesame street . in one of the more unusual statements to come out of the fourteenth international conference on aids in barcelona , which ended on friday , the vice-president of sesame workshop , joel schneider , announced that a character would be introduced in its south african program later in the year who will be hiv positive .
any colour , as long as it ’ s female schneider said the south african character hadn ’ t been named or designed yet , but it was likely to be a five-year-old girl .
" she ’ ll be lively , alert , friendly , outgoing and hiv-positive , " schneider said on thursday in barcelona .
" she will have high self-esteem .
women are often stigamised about hiv and we are providing a good role model as to how to deal with one ’ s situation and how to interact with the community . "
schneider says this is the main aim of having an hiv positive member on the famous muppet team .
he hopes that it will encourage " model positive behaviour " towards people with hiv and aids among viewers of the program , who are mostly between three and seven years old .
" we want to show children that it ’ s okay to touch , okay to hug , that a person can still be a constructive part of the community . "

-lrb- ap photo / marty lederhandler -rrb- " appropriate " not every takalani sesame show -lrb- takalani means ‘ be happy ’ in the tshivenda language -rrb- will deal explicitly with hiv / aids .
the hiv-positive character ’ s real world contemporaries who watch the program will not be seeing explicit sex or intravenous drug use .
instead the messages will be appropriate , schneider says .
" what do i do when i cut my finger ?
what do i do when i cut your finger ?
that sort of thing . "
spokesperson for the sesame street workshop in new york beatrice chow says takalani sesame will be the first show of its kind designed for pre-schoolers .
south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .
while adolescence is the time when most people become sexually active , a un study released this month has found that most young people between 15 and 24 have no idea how hiv is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .
young women are consistently found to have higher rates of infection than men in the same age group .
the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .
at the close of the conference , mandela gave a speech in which he referred to his long struggle against apartheid " often against odds that were considered insurmountable " .
a chilling reminder the six-day conference in barcelona attended by 15,000 health professionals and ngos was the biggest ever international gathering on hiv / aids .
unaids said the conference made progress towards finding a solution to the pandemic .
but aids campaigners said the meeting was a chilling reminder of the work still to be done .
they lamented that there was no cure or vaccine for the disease .
some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .
according to unaids , about 20 million people have died of aids since the disease was first detected more than twenty years ago in san francisco .
forty million people are currently infected with the human immune deficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- .

taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .
tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .
slow but reliable kai henning also believes that general public reaction in germany towards the work done by the foundation has been largely positive .
" we ’ ve received over 10 million euro -lrb- $ 9.88 million -rrb- from private individuals in germany alone " , he says .
to frequent criticism of the foundation working too slowly , henning says , " people say that we should work quickly , but at the same time we have to be careful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2002 hiv-positive character to join muppets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with muppets like these , who needs teachers ?
five-year-olds could soon be able to teach their parents a thing or two about aids .
an hiv-positive character will soon join the cast of the long-running children ’ s program sesame street . in one of the more unusual statements to come out of the fourteenth international conference on aids in barcelona , which ended on friday , the vice-president of sesame workshop , joel schneider , announced that a character would be introduced in its south african program later in the year who will be hiv positive .
any colour , as long as it ’ s female schneider said the south african character hadn ’ t been named or designed yet , but it was likely to be a five-year-old girl .
" she ’ ll be lively , alert , friendly , outgoing and hiv-positive , " schneider said on thursday in barcelona .
" she will have high self-esteem .
women are often stigamised about hiv and we are providing a good role model as to how to deal with one ’ s situation and how to interact with the community . "
schneider says this is the main aim of having an hiv positive member on the famous muppet team .
he hopes that it will encourage " model positive behaviour " towards people with hiv and aids among viewers of the program , who are mostly between three and seven years old .
" we want to show children that it ’ s okay to touch , okay to hug , that a person can still be a constructive part of the community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the cast of sesame street surround un secretary general kofi annan in new york .
-lrb- ap photo / marty lederhandler -rrb- " appropriate " not every takalani sesame show -lrb- takalani means ‘ be happy ’ in the tshivenda language -rrb- will deal explicitly with hiv / aids .
the hiv-positive character ’ s real world contemporaries who watch the program will not be seeing explicit sex or intravenous drug use .
instead the messages will be appropriate , schneider says .
" what do i do when i cut my finger ?
what do i do when i cut your finger ?
that sort of thing . "
spokesperson for the sesame street workshop in new york beatrice chow says takalani sesame will be the first show of its kind designed for pre-schoolers .
south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .
while adolescence is the time when most people become sexually active , a un study released this month has found that most young people between 15 and 24 have no idea how hiv is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .
young women are consistently found to have higher rates of infection than men in the same age group .
the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .
at the close of the conference , mandela gave a speech in which he referred to his long struggle against apartheid " often against odds that were considered insurmountable " .
a chilling reminder the six-day conference in barcelona attended by 15,000 health professionals and ngos was the biggest ever international gathering on hiv / aids .
unaids said the conference made progress towards finding a solution to the pandemic .
but aids campaigners said the meeting was a chilling reminder of the work still to be done .
they lamented that there was no cure or vaccine for the disease .
some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .
according to unaids , about 20 million people have died of aids since the disease was first detected more than twenty years ago in san francisco .
forty million people are currently infected with the human immune deficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- .
more than sixty million people are expected to die of aids by 2020 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links unaids barcelona conference the homepage of the xiv international conference on aids unicef aids information the kaiser network special coverage of the xiv international aids conference world health organisation the who homepage 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .

he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .

the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2002 over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compensation for holocaust survivors and former forced labourers has become an important international topic a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- have been paid to 817,000 claimants world-wide , a representative told dw-world . mr kai henning , of the german foundation , " remembering , responsibility and future " can hardly keep the pride out of his voice .
taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .
tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .
slow but reliable kai henning also believes that general public reaction in germany towards the work done by the foundation has been largely positive .
" we ’ ve received over 10 million euro -lrb- $ 9.88 million -rrb- from private individuals in germany alone " , he says .

five-year-olds could soon be able to teach their parents a thing or two about aids .
an hiv-positive character will soon join the cast of the long-running children ’ s program sesame street . in one of the more unusual statements to come out of the fourteenth international conference on aids in barcelona , which ended on friday , the vice-president of sesame workshop , joel schneider , announced that a character would be introduced in its south african program later in the year who will be hiv positive .
any colour , as long as it ’ s female schneider said the south african character hadn ’ t been named or designed yet , but it was likely to be a five-year-old girl .
" she ’ ll be lively , alert , friendly , outgoing and hiv-positive , " schneider said on thursday in barcelona .
" she will have high self-esteem .
women are often stigamised about hiv and we are providing a good role model as to how to deal with one ’ s situation and how to interact with the community . "
schneider says this is the main aim of having an hiv positive member on the famous muppet team .
he hopes that it will encourage " model positive behaviour " towards people with hiv and aids among viewers of the program , who are mostly between three and seven years old .
" we want to show children that it ’ s okay to touch , okay to hug , that a person can still be a constructive part of the community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the cast of sesame street surround un secretary general kofi annan in new york .
-lrb- ap photo / marty lederhandler -rrb- " appropriate " not every takalani sesame show -lrb- takalani means ‘ be happy ’ in the tshivenda language -rrb- will deal explicitly with hiv / aids .
the hiv-positive character ’ s real world contemporaries who watch the program will not be seeing explicit sex or intravenous drug use .
instead the messages will be appropriate , schneider says .
" what do i do when i cut my finger ?
what do i do when i cut your finger ?
that sort of thing . "
spokesperson for the sesame street workshop in new york beatrice chow says takalani sesame will be the first show of its kind designed for pre-schoolers .
south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .
while adolescence is the time when most people become sexually active , a un study released this month has found that most young people between 15 and 24 have no idea how hiv is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .
young women are consistently found to have higher rates of infection than men in the same age group .
the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .
at the close of the conference , mandela gave a speech in which he referred to his long struggle against apartheid " often against odds that were considered insurmountable " .
a chilling reminder the six-day conference in barcelona attended by 15,000 health professionals and ngos was the biggest ever international gathering on hiv / aids .
unaids said the conference made progress towards finding a solution to the pandemic .
but aids campaigners said the meeting was a chilling reminder of the work still to be done .
they lamented that there was no cure or vaccine for the disease .
some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .
according to unaids , about 20 million people have died of aids since the disease was first detected more than twenty years ago in san francisco .
forty million people are currently infected with the human immune deficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- .
more than sixty million people are expected to die of aids by 2020 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links unaids barcelona conference the homepage of the xiv international conference on aids unicef aids information the kaiser network special coverage of the xiv international aids conference world health organisation the who homepage 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

five-year-olds could soon be able to teach their parents a thing or two about aids .
an hiv-positive character will soon join the cast of the long-running children ’ s program sesame street . in one of the more unusual statements to come out of the fourteenth international conference on aids in barcelona , which ended on friday , the vice-president of sesame workshop , joel schneider , announced that a character would be introduced in its south african program later in the year who will be hiv positive .

" she ’ ll be lively , alert , friendly , outgoing and hiv-positive , " schneider said on thursday in barcelona .
" she will have high self-esteem .
women are often stigamised about hiv and we are providing a good role model as to how to deal with one ’ s situation and how to interact with the community . "
schneider says this is the main aim of having an hiv positive member on the famous muppet team .
he hopes that it will encourage " model positive behaviour " towards people with hiv and aids among viewers of the program , who are mostly between three and seven years old .
" we want to show children that it ’ s okay to touch , okay to hug , that a person can still be a constructive part of the community . "

south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .
while adolescence is the time when most people become sexually active , a un study released this month has found that most young people between 15 and 24 have no idea how hiv is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .
young women are consistently found to have higher rates of infection than men in the same age group .
the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .
at the close of the conference , mandela gave a speech in which he referred to his long struggle against apartheid " often against odds that were considered insurmountable " .
a chilling reminder the six-day conference in barcelona attended by 15,000 health professionals and ngos was the biggest ever international gathering on hiv / aids .
unaids said the conference made progress towards finding a solution to the pandemic .

they lamented that there was no cure or vaccine for the disease .
some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .
according to unaids , about 20 million people have died of aids since the disease was first detected more than twenty years ago in san francisco .

five-year-olds could soon be able to teach their parents a thing or two about aids .
an hiv-positive character will soon join the cast of the long-running children ’ s program sesame street . in one of the more unusual statements to come out of the fourteenth international conference on aids in barcelona , which ended on friday , the vice-president of sesame workshop , joel schneider , announced that a character would be introduced in its south african program later in the year who will be hiv positive .
any colour , as long as it ’ s female schneider said the south african character hadn ’ t been named or designed yet , but it was likely to be a five-year-old girl .
" she ’ ll be lively , alert , friendly , outgoing and hiv-positive , " schneider said on thursday in barcelona .
" she will have high self-esteem .
women are often stigamised about hiv and we are providing a good role model as to how to deal with one ’ s situation and how to interact with the community . "
schneider says this is the main aim of having an hiv positive member on the famous muppet team .
he hopes that it will encourage " model positive behaviour " towards people with hiv and aids among viewers of the program , who are mostly between three and seven years old .
" we want to show children that it ’ s okay to touch , okay to hug , that a person can still be a constructive part of the community . "

the hiv-positive character ’ s real world contemporaries who watch the program will not be seeing explicit sex or intravenous drug use .
instead the messages will be appropriate , schneider says .
" what do i do when i cut my finger ?
what do i do when i cut your finger ?
that sort of thing . "
spokesperson for the sesame street workshop in new york beatrice chow says takalani sesame will be the first show of its kind designed for pre-schoolers .
south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .
while adolescence is the time when most people become sexually active , a un study released this month has found that most young people between 15 and 24 have no idea how hiv is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .
young women are consistently found to have higher rates of infection than men in the same age group .
the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .
at the close of the conference , mandela gave a speech in which he referred to his long struggle against apartheid " often against odds that were considered insurmountable " .
a chilling reminder the six-day conference in barcelona attended by 15,000 health professionals and ngos was the biggest ever international gathering on hiv / aids .
unaids said the conference made progress towards finding a solution to the pandemic .
but aids campaigners said the meeting was a chilling reminder of the work still to be done .
they lamented that there was no cure or vaccine for the disease .
some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .
according to unaids , about 20 million people have died of aids since the disease was first detected more than twenty years ago in san francisco .
forty million people are currently infected with the human immune deficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- .

the skies over europe are in danger of future accidents unless co-operation and compatability can be secured between contradicting air traffic control centres across the continent . in the wake of the recent german air disaster , the on-going dissection of evidence and proportioning of blame highlights the rifts and inadequecies of air traffic control systems in charge of european skies .
investigations have shown that as well as receiving contradictory instructions just before the crash , the russian pilot may have been flying by rules different from those followed in the rest of europe .
contradictions in flight rules put passengers at risk a lethal grey area has emerged in the aftermath of last week 's mid-air collision over lake constance in germany .
evidence has surfaced that suggests that both pilots were acting in a way they had been told was correct .
european officials insist that international rules oblige pilots to follow the orders of their onboard systems , the aircraft collision avoidance system -lrb- acas -rrb- , and ignore conflicting advice from air traffic control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : control center of the swiss air traffic control skyguide .
but russian officials this week insisted that their pilots were expected to consider both the orders of air traffic control and onboard systems , before making their own decision .
a directive set out in an international civilian aviation organisation -lrb- icao -rrb- document stipulates that in the event of a clash between the instruction given by air traffic control and a high-level alert from the onboard acas system - known as a resolution advisory - ' the pilot should follow the resolution advisory ' .
" the performance-based training objectives were sent out to all states by an icao state letter in 1997 .
the russians will have received the icao guidance , " said john law , the project manager for the acas system at the european air traffic control centre , eurocontrol .
but his version of the rules was challenged by yuri tarshin , the head of the department of aviation standards at the russian ministry of transport .
" russian aviation companies who fly in europe do so under european rules , " mr tarshin said .
" in european rules for training of pilots , you can find nowhere where it says what is the priority.the decision is up to the main pilot .
he has to take into account all the information , particularly when there is a resolution advisory . "
" we follow the european standards of the countries in whose airspace we fly .
if we had a document saying that the pilot should , in any case , obey the signals of the acas , then we would follow it .
but that document does not exist . "

the single european sky project is designed to improve air safety , reduce costs and minimise delays by ensuring consistent operating practices between the 64 different national air traffic control centres across the continent by using a new satellite-based air traffic management system that will carry the seamless exchange of flight information .
the plans will be in place by 2004 , but no deadline for implementation has been set .

the skies over europe are in danger of future accidents unless co-operation and compatability can be secured between contradicting air traffic control centres across the continent . in the wake of the recent german air disaster , the on-going dissection of evidence and proportioning of blame highlights the rifts and inadequecies of air traffic control systems in charge of european skies .
investigations have shown that as well as receiving contradictory instructions just before the crash , the russian pilot may have been flying by rules different from those followed in the rest of europe .
contradictions in flight rules put passengers at risk a lethal grey area has emerged in the aftermath of last week 's mid-air collision over lake constance in germany .
evidence has surfaced that suggests that both pilots were acting in a way they had been told was correct .
european officials insist that international rules oblige pilots to follow the orders of their onboard systems , the aircraft collision avoidance system -lrb- acas -rrb- , and ignore conflicting advice from air traffic control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : control center of the swiss air traffic control skyguide .
but russian officials this week insisted that their pilots were expected to consider both the orders of air traffic control and onboard systems , before making their own decision .
a directive set out in an international civilian aviation organisation -lrb- icao -rrb- document stipulates that in the event of a clash between the instruction given by air traffic control and a high-level alert from the onboard acas system - known as a resolution advisory - ' the pilot should follow the resolution advisory ' .
" the performance-based training objectives were sent out to all states by an icao state letter in 1997 .
the russians will have received the icao guidance , " said john law , the project manager for the acas system at the european air traffic control centre , eurocontrol .
but his version of the rules was challenged by yuri tarshin , the head of the department of aviation standards at the russian ministry of transport .
" russian aviation companies who fly in europe do so under european rules , " mr tarshin said .
" in european rules for training of pilots , you can find nowhere where it says what is the priority.the decision is up to the main pilot .
he has to take into account all the information , particularly when there is a resolution advisory . "
" we follow the european standards of the countries in whose airspace we fly .
if we had a document saying that the pilot should , in any case , obey the signals of the acas , then we would follow it .
but that document does not exist . "
mep 's bid to consolidate european airspace plans these revelations come in the same week that european parliament ministers met to discuss plans for making incompatible air traffic control systems communicate with each other , creating a single view of european airspace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single european sky may help to avoid inconsistencies in policy .
the single european sky project is designed to improve air safety , reduce costs and minimise delays by ensuring consistent operating practices between the 64 different national air traffic control centres across the continent by using a new satellite-based air traffic management system that will carry the seamless exchange of flight information .
the plans will be in place by 2004 , but no deadline for implementation has been set .
' outdated ' european air control in need of reform ' the proposal for a single european sky is an ambitious attempt to reform the outdated architecture of european air traffic control .
it comes at a time when new positioning and communication technologies offer opportunities for significant improvements in the efficiency and safety of air travel , ' said loyola de palacio , european commissioner for energy and transport .
eurocontrol , the european air safety organisation , has been working with the ec to define systems and architectural guidelines , and will play a vital role in enforcing the initiative .
all european air traffic controllers will have to ensure compliance .
in the meantime , air travel safety will remain a lottery . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de investigators seek answers to crash investigators near lake constance try to find answers to germany 's worst plane crash in nearly 30 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2002 over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compensation for holocaust survivors and former forced labourers has become an important international topic a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- have been paid to 817,000 claimants world-wide , a representative told dw-world . mr kai henning , of the german foundation , " remembering , responsibility and future " can hardly keep the pride out of his voice .
taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .
tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .
slow but reliable kai henning also believes that general public reaction in germany towards the work done by the foundation has been largely positive .
" we ’ ve received over 10 million euro -lrb- $ 9.88 million -rrb- from private individuals in germany alone " , he says .
to frequent criticism of the foundation working too slowly , henning says , " people say that we should work quickly , but at the same time we have to be careful .
we need to verify claims thoroughly , or we ’ d be accused of squandering money on false claims .
we need to find a good balance " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .
tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .
slow but reliable kai henning also believes that general public reaction in germany towards the work done by the foundation has been largely positive .
" we ’ ve received over 10 million euro -lrb- $ 9.88 million -rrb- from private individuals in germany alone " , he says .
to frequent criticism of the foundation working too slowly , henning says , " people say that we should work quickly , but at the same time we have to be careful .
we need to verify claims thoroughly , or we ’ d be accused of squandering money on false claims .
we need to find a good balance " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the skies over europe are in danger of future accidents unless co-operation and compatability can be secured between contradicting air traffic control centres across the continent . in the wake of the recent german air disaster , the on-going dissection of evidence and proportioning of blame highlights the rifts and inadequecies of air traffic control systems in charge of european skies .
investigations have shown that as well as receiving contradictory instructions just before the crash , the russian pilot may have been flying by rules different from those followed in the rest of europe .
contradictions in flight rules put passengers at risk a lethal grey area has emerged in the aftermath of last week 's mid-air collision over lake constance in germany .
evidence has surfaced that suggests that both pilots were acting in a way they had been told was correct .
european officials insist that international rules oblige pilots to follow the orders of their onboard systems , the aircraft collision avoidance system -lrb- acas -rrb- , and ignore conflicting advice from air traffic control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : control center of the swiss air traffic control skyguide .
but russian officials this week insisted that their pilots were expected to consider both the orders of air traffic control and onboard systems , before making their own decision .
a directive set out in an international civilian aviation organisation -lrb- icao -rrb- document stipulates that in the event of a clash between the instruction given by air traffic control and a high-level alert from the onboard acas system - known as a resolution advisory - ' the pilot should follow the resolution advisory ' .
" the performance-based training objectives were sent out to all states by an icao state letter in 1997 .
the russians will have received the icao guidance , " said john law , the project manager for the acas system at the european air traffic control centre , eurocontrol .
but his version of the rules was challenged by yuri tarshin , the head of the department of aviation standards at the russian ministry of transport .
" russian aviation companies who fly in europe do so under european rules , " mr tarshin said .
" in european rules for training of pilots , you can find nowhere where it says what is the priority.the decision is up to the main pilot .
he has to take into account all the information , particularly when there is a resolution advisory . "
" we follow the european standards of the countries in whose airspace we fly .
if we had a document saying that the pilot should , in any case , obey the signals of the acas , then we would follow it .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a single european sky may help to avoid inconsistencies in policy .
the single european sky project is designed to improve air safety , reduce costs and minimise delays by ensuring consistent operating practices between the 64 different national air traffic control centres across the continent by using a new satellite-based air traffic management system that will carry the seamless exchange of flight information .
the plans will be in place by 2004 , but no deadline for implementation has been set .
' outdated ' european air control in need of reform ' the proposal for a single european sky is an ambitious attempt to reform the outdated architecture of european air traffic control .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2002 over 800,000 former forced labourers compensated großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compensation for holocaust survivors and former forced labourers has become an important international topic a year after the german foundation to financially compensate holocaust survivors was set up , 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- have been paid to 817,000 claimants world-wide , a representative told dw-world . mr kai henning , of the german foundation , " remembering , responsibility and future " can hardly keep the pride out of his voice .
taking stock of his foundation ’ s work a year after it was established , he told dw-world in an interview , " it ’ s a success story .
almost half of the claimants who have approached us in this past year , have been compensated " .
almost exactly a year ago , the german government set up the foundation under public law .
the aim was to provide financial compensation through seven partner organisations all over the world , to former forced labourers as well as those who suffered injustices during the reign of the national socialists in germany .
together with german corporate companies joined together in the foundation initiative of german industry and the german federal government , the project was outfitted with 4 billion euro .
compensation paid from poland to the bahamas today 1,5 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.48 billion -rrb- from the foundation ’ s compensation fund has been paid to about 817,000 claimants living in over 70 countries from poland to the bahamas .
" of course the number of cases of former forced labourers now living in exotic countries such as the bahamas , philippines or thailand is negligible " , says kai henning , among other things press spokesman and negotiator of the " remembering , responsibility and future " foundation .
the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .
tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .
slow but reliable kai henning also believes that general public reaction in germany towards the work done by the foundation has been largely positive .
" we ’ ve received over 10 million euro -lrb- $ 9.88 million -rrb- from private individuals in germany alone " , he says .
to frequent criticism of the foundation working too slowly , henning says , " people say that we should work quickly , but at the same time we have to be careful .
we need to verify claims thoroughly , or we ’ d be accused of squandering money on false claims .
we need to find a good balance " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the bulk of the claims compensated so far come from poland , he says .
more than 327,000 claimants there have received 462 million euro -lrb- $ 456.79 million -rrb- as compensation .
poland is followed by ukraine and belarus in terms of claims compensated .
usually individual compensation sums are paid by the foundation in two instalments .
after the initial painstaking work of verifying the claims , the second instalment is " usually much quicker " , says henning .
he reckons that the german foundation should complete work of paying out the first instalment with its partner organisations notably in the czech republic , poland and the conference on jewish material claims against germany -lrb- jcc -rrb- by the end of 2002 .
unmanageable flood of claims but despite the sizeable amount of work that the foundation has already achieved , the 40-member team at the foundation ’ s headquarters in berlin still faces a daunting task .
it could take up to another three years before all the claimants receive their compensations .
" we ’ re overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of claims we have to deal with – over two million " , says henning .
" initially we faced the problem of making former forced labourers aware of the existence of our foundation , especially to people living in remote villages places such as the republics of the former soviet union .
but we ’ re confident that we ’ ve reached almost everybody " .
verifying credibility of claims a laborious task but now the foundation faces another problem of verifying the credibility of the claims that it receives .
" we did receive some easy cases in the early stage , where former forced labourers had the necessary documentation or identity cards to prove their status during the national socialist years .
but it ’ s becoming increasingly difficult as claimants , not just forced labourers , but even jews whose insurance policies were not paid during the nazi years , now want to claim compensation without any kind of papers " , says henning .
the problem is compounded by the fact that people in the former soviet union for example , were forced to destroy their insurance policies or identification in communist times for fear of being termed " collaborators " of the nazis .
at the same time henning says that the " law provides a broad spectrum of what can be accepted as proof of one ’ s status during the third reich " .
apart from official documentation , even letters and witnesses are accepted as proof .
on the downside , processing the claims takes even longer .
tracking down people in communal and company archives is a painstaking job .
the foundation is helped in this by the international search service -lrb- isd -rrb- in bad arolsen in the german state of hessen , and a newly-opened branch office in cologne .
henning also says that a 40-member team is just not enough for a task on such a mammoth scale .
slow but reliable kai henning also believes that general public reaction in germany towards the work done by the foundation has been largely positive .
" we ’ ve received over 10 million euro -lrb- $ 9.88 million -rrb- from private individuals in germany alone " , he says .
to frequent criticism of the foundation working too slowly , henning says , " people say that we should work quickly , but at the same time we have to be careful .
we need to verify claims thoroughly , or we ’ d be accused of squandering money on false claims .
we need to find a good balance " . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.07.2002 hiv-positive character to join muppets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with muppets like these , who needs teachers ?
five-year-olds could soon be able to teach their parents a thing or two about aids .
an hiv-positive character will soon join the cast of the long-running children ’ s program sesame street . in one of the more unusual statements to come out of the fourteenth international conference on aids in barcelona , which ended on friday , the vice-president of sesame workshop , joel schneider , announced that a character would be introduced in its south african program later in the year who will be hiv positive .
any colour , as long as it ’ s female schneider said the south african character hadn ’ t been named or designed yet , but it was likely to be a five-year-old girl .
" she ’ ll be lively , alert , friendly , outgoing and hiv-positive , " schneider said on thursday in barcelona .
" she will have high self-esteem .
women are often stigamised about hiv and we are providing a good role model as to how to deal with one ’ s situation and how to interact with the community . "
schneider says this is the main aim of having an hiv positive member on the famous muppet team .
he hopes that it will encourage " model positive behaviour " towards people with hiv and aids among viewers of the program , who are mostly between three and seven years old .
" we want to show children that it ’ s okay to touch , okay to hug , that a person can still be a constructive part of the community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the cast of sesame street surround un secretary general kofi annan in new york .
-lrb- ap photo / marty lederhandler -rrb- " appropriate " not every takalani sesame show -lrb- takalani means ‘ be happy ’ in the tshivenda language -rrb- will deal explicitly with hiv / aids .
the hiv-positive character ’ s real world contemporaries who watch the program will not be seeing explicit sex or intravenous drug use .
instead the messages will be appropriate , schneider says .
" what do i do when i cut my finger ?
what do i do when i cut your finger ?
that sort of thing . "
spokesperson for the sesame street workshop in new york beatrice chow says takalani sesame will be the first show of its kind designed for pre-schoolers .
south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .
while adolescence is the time when most people become sexually active , a un study released this month has found that most young people between 15 and 24 have no idea how hiv is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .
young women are consistently found to have higher rates of infection than men in the same age group .
the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .
at the close of the conference , mandela gave a speech in which he referred to his long struggle against apartheid " often against odds that were considered insurmountable " .
a chilling reminder the six-day conference in barcelona attended by 15,000 health professionals and ngos was the biggest ever international gathering on hiv / aids .
unaids said the conference made progress towards finding a solution to the pandemic .
but aids campaigners said the meeting was a chilling reminder of the work still to be done .
they lamented that there was no cure or vaccine for the disease .
some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .
according to unaids , about 20 million people have died of aids since the disease was first detected more than twenty years ago in san francisco .
forty million people are currently infected with the human immune deficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- .
more than sixty million people are expected to die of aids by 2020 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links unaids barcelona conference the homepage of the xiv international conference on aids unicef aids information the kaiser network special coverage of the xiv international aids conference world health organisation the who homepage 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

five-year-olds could soon be able to teach their parents a thing or two about aids .
an hiv-positive character will soon join the cast of the long-running children ’ s program sesame street . in one of the more unusual statements to come out of the fourteenth international conference on aids in barcelona , which ended on friday , the vice-president of sesame workshop , joel schneider , announced that a character would be introduced in its south african program later in the year who will be hiv positive .
any colour , as long as it ’ s female schneider said the south african character hadn ’ t been named or designed yet , but it was likely to be a five-year-old girl .
" she ’ ll be lively , alert , friendly , outgoing and hiv-positive , " schneider said on thursday in barcelona .
" she will have high self-esteem .
women are often stigamised about hiv and we are providing a good role model as to how to deal with one ’ s situation and how to interact with the community . "
schneider says this is the main aim of having an hiv positive member on the famous muppet team .
he hopes that it will encourage " model positive behaviour " towards people with hiv and aids among viewers of the program , who are mostly between three and seven years old .
" we want to show children that it ’ s okay to touch , okay to hug , that a person can still be a constructive part of the community . "

south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .
while adolescence is the time when most people become sexually active , a un study released this month has found that most young people between 15 and 24 have no idea how hiv is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .
young women are consistently found to have higher rates of infection than men in the same age group .
the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .
at the close of the conference , mandela gave a speech in which he referred to his long struggle against apartheid " often against odds that were considered insurmountable " .

they lamented that there was no cure or vaccine for the disease .
some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .
according to unaids , about 20 million people have died of aids since the disease was first detected more than twenty years ago in san francisco .

five-year-olds could soon be able to teach their parents a thing or two about aids .
an hiv-positive character will soon join the cast of the long-running children ’ s program sesame street . in one of the more unusual statements to come out of the fourteenth international conference on aids in barcelona , which ended on friday , the vice-president of sesame workshop , joel schneider , announced that a character would be introduced in its south african program later in the year who will be hiv positive .
any colour , as long as it ’ s female schneider said the south african character hadn ’ t been named or designed yet , but it was likely to be a five-year-old girl .
" she ’ ll be lively , alert , friendly , outgoing and hiv-positive , " schneider said on thursday in barcelona .
" she will have high self-esteem .
women are often stigamised about hiv and we are providing a good role model as to how to deal with one ’ s situation and how to interact with the community . "
schneider says this is the main aim of having an hiv positive member on the famous muppet team .
he hopes that it will encourage " model positive behaviour " towards people with hiv and aids among viewers of the program , who are mostly between three and seven years old .
" we want to show children that it ’ s okay to touch , okay to hug , that a person can still be a constructive part of the community . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the cast of sesame street surround un secretary general kofi annan in new york .
-lrb- ap photo / marty lederhandler -rrb- " appropriate " not every takalani sesame show -lrb- takalani means ‘ be happy ’ in the tshivenda language -rrb- will deal explicitly with hiv / aids .
the hiv-positive character ’ s real world contemporaries who watch the program will not be seeing explicit sex or intravenous drug use .
instead the messages will be appropriate , schneider says .
" what do i do when i cut my finger ?
what do i do when i cut your finger ?
that sort of thing . "
spokesperson for the sesame street workshop in new york beatrice chow says takalani sesame will be the first show of its kind designed for pre-schoolers .
south africa already has one children ’ s program with an hiv-positive character .
it seems there ’ s at least one good reason to start while you ’ re young – the message doesn ’ t seem to be getting through to a lot of older children .
while adolescence is the time when most people become sexually active , a un study released this month has found that most young people between 15 and 24 have no idea how hiv is transmitted or how to protect themselves from the disease .
south africa lagging on aids prevention south africa has more hiv-infected people than any other country .
health agencies estimate that since 1996 , the number of cases has doubled to more than 4 million , or 1 in 10 people .
young women are consistently found to have higher rates of infection than men in the same age group .
the former south african president , nelson mandela , on friday joined other world leaders in urging campaigners not to lose heart in their war against the aids pandemic .
at the close of the conference , mandela gave a speech in which he referred to his long struggle against apartheid " often against odds that were considered insurmountable " .
a chilling reminder the six-day conference in barcelona attended by 15,000 health professionals and ngos was the biggest ever international gathering on hiv / aids .
unaids said the conference made progress towards finding a solution to the pandemic .
but aids campaigners said the meeting was a chilling reminder of the work still to be done .
they lamented that there was no cure or vaccine for the disease .
some grass-roots activists accused the weathy countries of the world of providing insufficient money and ensuring the cost of anti-aids drugs remained high .
the next international aids conference will take place in bangkok in july 2004 .
according to unaids , about 20 million people have died of aids since the disease was first detected more than twenty years ago in san francisco .
forty million people are currently infected with the human immune deficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- .
more than sixty million people are expected to die of aids by 2020 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links unaids barcelona conference the homepage of the xiv international conference on aids unicef aids information the kaiser network special coverage of the xiv international aids conference world health organisation the who homepage 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the emergency contraceptive pill will be on sale this weekend when 50,000 people are expected to descend on balado , near kinross , for scotland 's annual music festival .
according to the company responsible the decision forms part of a health message .
but a catholic church spokesman said he believed the move did not have the revellers ' best interests at heart .
leaflets on health and safe sex , handed out at this year 's festival by schering health care -lrb- sch -rrb- , will advertise the levonelle morning after pill .
the pill is an emergency contraceptive which can be used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex .
scottish roman catholic church spokesman , peter kearney said : " this is a cynical marketing exercise .
it 's about profits and money . "
" it certainly is n't about young people 's self esteem , their worth or long term health .
" that is secondary to cashing in on what will be a group of vulnerable people open to powerful messages . "
however , the company defended it position and said its sole aim was to deliver sensible messages to all those people who travelled to t in the park .
dr graham barker of sch said it was important to ensure everyone had a safe and enjoyable time .
' good time ' " these are all good , sensible health awareness messages which i am sure will be useful and practical to people this weekend , " he said .
" when all is said in done they are there to have a good time . "
jackie nicholson of the family planning association said it was " much better " to have such services on hand during the festival and provide advice to people rather than allowing them to " wait and worry " .
organisers of this year 's event have said they plan to make a number of changes to the way the different stages are organised with a view to giving bands more exposure .
oasis and the chemical brothers are among the headline acts as the event enters its ninth year .

the latest crime statistics have something for everyone and have led to some confusion .
that is because there is not just one set of figures but two .
the recorded crime statistics reflect those offences in the official figures compiled by the 43 police forces in england and wales .
on the other hand , the british crime survey -lrb- bcs -rrb- is based on interviews with the public .
this year is the largest sample ever at more than 30,000 people having taken part . : facts and figures crime figures by key offence and region the bcs picks up crimes that may not be reported to the police like low-level assaults and criminal damage .
to further add to the complexity , police forces are beginning to adopt a new set of standards over the way they record crime .
certain kinds of crime have fallen this , according to the government 's number crunchers , adds a 5 % increase to the recorded crime figures .
these figures also include information on the public perception of crime and police detection rates which , on the face of it , seem to vary widely .
the government is not making too much of that fact but merely says police officers should be questioning why detection rates in similar areas should be different .
according to the recorded crime figures -lrb- after subtracting the 5 % increase for new reporting criteria -rrb- crime overall has increased by 2 % .
in contrast , the british crime survey says it has fallen by 2 % .
stable crime situation the line from the government is that this reflects a stable situation , with crime not increasing after several years of declining crime figures , in particular 14 % down since 1999 .
but within that overall picture by picking a year in the past , the government has been able to point to significant declines in certain types of crime .
for example , according to the british crime survey , domestic burglary is down by 39 % since 1997 . : burglary figures 20 years of burglary it also maintains that the chances of being a victim of crime remain at around the lowest levels since the british crime survey came into being in 1981 .
robberies have soared by more than 25 percent however robbery - demanding or taking something with the use or threat of violence - has apparently soared by 28 % according to the recorded crime figures compared with the previous year .
the british crime survey shows this type of offence at even higher levels but government statisticians say the comparison is not as fair because of a relatively small sample the year before .
although robbery only represents 2 % of total crime , street crime is a politically high profile issue .

education is expected to receive a generous share of the extra funds available - but there will be a queue of competing interests waiting to spend it .
education funding priorities student funding university expansion teachers ' workload school budgets education maintenance allowances further education students concerned at growing levels of debt will be looking for extra cash to reform the current system of loans and tuition fees .
the department for education , sensitive to headlines about student hardship , has been carrying out a major review of how students are funded through university .
and the type of system that might emerge - but which will not be known until the autumn - will depend on the chancellor 's spending plans .
university challenge the funding review could increase financial support for students from less well-off families - but it now seems less likely that there will be a graduate tax to re-pay loans .
the higher education sector as a whole has been banging the drum loudly for extra money , saying that the targets for more young people to enter university need to be matched by more funding .
so university vice-chancellors will also be expecting a pay-out from mr brown .
widening participation is set to be a theme throughout the education spending plans - with expectations that there will be money for an allowance to keep more teenagers in school .
the " education maintenance allowance " , which provides 16 year olds with up to £ 40 a week to stay in education , is expected to be expanded from pilot schemes to a national programme .
mr brown has long planned to fund this by ending universal child benefit for the over-16s who are still in education .
there has been speculation that such allowances might be extended to become part of the funding arrangements for university students .
school drop-outs compared with other developed countries , the united kingdom has a relatively low rate of staying on in education after the age of 16 - and there have been arguments that such a drop-out rate harms the economy .
teachers have also made clear that they expect the spending review to fund improvements in their working conditions .
teachers ' unions have threatened industrial action unless they receive a shorter working week and a reduction in workload .
head teachers have also been pressing hard for an increase to school budgets .
more for schools and colleges a head teachers ' union last month attacked the " myth " that schools had already received large funding increases .
and heads warned that 45 % of schools will have to cut staff unless they receive a larger basic budget .
a complication is that a new funding mechanism for local authorities - put out to consultation this week - could see budgets frozen for a time .
again , it all depends on how much gordon brown stumps up .
there have also been calls from further education that a cash injection is needed to sustain the sector .
further education colleges will be at the forefront of any widening participation in education - and there have been calls for extra funding to help raise standards .
the treasury might have cause for a little scepticism : much to the annoyance of those running education services , the department for education and skills has in recent years failed to spend some 4 % of its annual budget - about £ 1.6bn.

the spending review is a labour innovation designed to set out clearly the government 's public spending priorities over the next three years .
it announces how the £ 400bn worth of government funds are to be divided up .
it replaced the autumn statement , the annual struggle by spending departments for more government funds .
the spending review holds huge importance , not just in terms of what government departments are able to spend but also for the direction of the government 's political strategy .
what is the spending review ?
it fixes spending plans for three years it takes place every two years this review will lay out spending plans from 2003 to 2006 the first spending review took place in 1998 during its first period in office , labour made big changes in spending priorities .
debt interest was reduced , and social security spending -lrb- the largest spending item -rrb- held constant , while the chancellor clearly put health and education at the top of his agenda .
this year they are likely to be winners again - but transport and crime prevention are also fighting for priority and defence , too , will get more attention .
the statement itself is made by chancellor gordon brown to parliament .
in the days following his statement individual government departments will give details of how they intend to spend the money .
but the chancellor 's annual budget statements can either update or pre-empt the spending review .
take , for example , the last budget which announced a huge increase in health spending to be funded by increases in national insurance payments .
why change the system ?
in 1998 mr brown said the point of the new system was " to move from the short-termism of the annual cycle and to draw up public expenditure plans not on a one-year basis but on a three-year basis " .
critics of the old , one-year strategy had argued that it contributed to a damaging ' boom and bust ' cycle of spending .
for example , health spending would tend to soar whenever there was a beds crisis , only to be slashed again when government debt grew .
the spending review sought to break this circle by setting out long-term aims and objectives .
the long-term approach was also expected to help concentrate on public investment in transport infrastructure and buildings , which has suffered most in earlier years .
mr brown is still hoping for a big boost in public investment , although so far underspending has proved a serious problem .
but it is important to bear in mind that only half of all government spending will be covered by the three-year spending targets .
the remainder is still being planned on an annual basis because the cost of such areas as social security and debt interest can not be predicted , and vary , based on the current state of the economy .
too much central control ?
the treasury believes its approach has led to a smoother path for public spending , and better allocation of resources .
it wants to put more emphasis on whether spending departments can improve their productivity and actually deliver better services in return for more money .
so it has insisted on performance agreements with other government departments , setting out targets which they are expected to meet - and which will be used to determine whether they receive extra funds in the future .
but critics say that the new procedures - especially the agreements that departments now have to sign with the treasury outlining their performance targets - give too much power to the treasury , and the chancellor , to centralise power .

now the country is holding its collective breath to see exactly where the chancellor is going to spend his huge amount of extra cash .
the government may be about to embark on too much spending which it will not be able to finance vicky price , chief economic advisor , dti despite the big increases , however , public spending as a proportion of the nation 's economy will still be lower than during john major 's term of office - so public expectations of big improvements in public services may be wide of the mark .
and many economists will be worrying about what effect gordon brown 's three year public spending spree will have on the government 's finances .
this spending review , labour 's third , will lay out major increases in funds for public services .
health will get a pre-announced £ 40bn cash boost over the next five years .
health spending will grow by 7.4 % a year in real terms during this period , in line with the recommendations of the recent wanless report .
it will take uk health spending as a proportion of national income from 7.7 % now to 9.4 % in 2007-08 , fulfilling tony blair 's pledge to match the eu average .
education targeted there have also been strong hints that education is in line for a large boost in funding .
the highly regarded economic think-tank , the institute for fiscal studies , has calculated that even after the extra spending on health , there would still be enough money left to boost the education budget by £ 14bn by 2006 .
social security - already by far the largest single element in government spending - is set to grow to pay for brown 's new anti-poverty tax credits .
there will also be strong pressure to find more cash for the police , defence and transport budgets .
all this is being funded by a combination of over £ 8.5bn of tax rises annually , as well as some sleight of hand by which the treasury raised its expectations for economic growth and future tax revenues .
taxes to rise ?
however , the suspicion among many economists is that this still wo n't raise nearly enough money to pay for the extra spending , and that taxes will have to be hiked again , probably as early as the next budget .
a likely candidate for a further tax increase would be another uncapped 1p on employee national insurance , which higher earners would pay on their entire income .
this would raise about £ 3.8bn.
the public finances are already projected to slide into the red over the next four years and beyond as brown 's fabled " war chest " gets used up .
brown insists this will not breech his self-imposed fiscal rules governing acceptable levels of government borrowing .
weak growth the headache for the government is that the projections on which these rules are based assume the economy will grow by at least 2.5 % a year .
this needs to happen to generate sufficient tax revenues .
but growth has been near zero over the last six months , and it looks very unlikely that the target will be achieved this year .
the influential item club of economic forecasters warned after the april budget that revenue projections by the treasury would not be enough to cover its spending plans .
even some government officials admit that taxes will have to go up again .
in a surprisingly candid interview last month vicky price , the new chief economic advisor to the department of trade and industry said : " the government may be about to embark on too much spending which it will not be able to finance .
the nhs , education and transport require so much money they will have to raise taxes . "
the ifs has also pointed out that mr brown 's health spending plans cover five years , but the government has only set out three years of tax rises , implying a potential " black hole " in the government 's finances after 2005/06 .
conflict with europe the spending review may cause further complications over any future plans to take britain into the euro .
the european commission has attacked the government 's spending plans on several previous occasions for breaching the eu growth and stability pact , which set a limit of 3 % of gdp on government borrowing .
brown has his own rules on borrowing , but these take a much more relaxed view on so-called investment spending , allowing him to greatly boost government spending on roads , schools , and hospitals , while still claiming he is being cautious .
in depth coverage key stories education 's £ 15bn new cash , new targets at the sharp end public service voices teachers fear catch analysis brown 's high stakes unanswered questions brown 's prudence new era for defence q & a : who gains ?
can brown deliver ?

now the country is holding its collective breath to see exactly where the chancellor is going to spend his huge amount of extra cash . "
the government may be about to embark on too much spending which it will not be able to finance " vicky price , chief economic advisor , dti despite the big increases , however , public spending as a proportion of the nation 's economy will still be lower than during john major 's term of office - so public expectations of big improvements in public services may be wide of the mark .
and many economists will be worrying about what effect gordon brown 's three year public spending spree will have on the government 's finances .
this spending review , labour 's third , will lay out major increases in funds for public services .
health will get a pre-announced £ 40bn cash boost over the next five years .
health spending will grow by 7.4 % a year in real terms during this period , in line with the recommendations of the recent wanless report .
it will take uk health spending as a proportion of national income from 7.7 % now to 9.4 % in 2007-08 , fulfilling tony blair 's pledge to match the eu average .
education targeted there have also been strong hints that education is in line for a large boost in funding .
the highly regarded economic think-tank , the institute for fiscal studies , has calculated that even after the extra spending on health , there would still be enough money left to boost the education budget by £ 14bn by 2006 .
social security - already by far the largest single element in government spending - is set to grow to pay for brown 's new anti-poverty tax credits .
there will also be strong pressure to find more cash for the police , defence and transport budgets .
all this is being funded by a combination of over £ 8.5bn of tax rises annually , as well as some sleight of hand by which the treasury raised its expectations for economic growth and future tax revenues .
taxes to rise ?
however , the suspicion among many economists is that this still wo n't raise nearly enough money to pay for the extra spending , and that taxes will have to be hiked again , probably as early as the next budget .
a likely candidate for a further tax increase would be another uncapped 1p on employee national insurance , which higher earners would pay on their entire income .
this would raise about £ 3.8bn.
the public finances are already projected to slide into the red over the next four years and beyond as brown 's fabled " war chest " gets used up .
brown insists this will not breech his self-imposed fiscal rules governing acceptable levels of government borrowing .
weak growth the headache for the government is that the projections on which these rules are based assume the economy will grow by at least 2.5 % a year .
this needs to happen to generate sufficient tax revenues .
but growth has been near zero over the last six months , and it looks very unlikely that the target will be achieved this year .
the influential item club of economic forecasters warned after the april budget that revenue projections by the treasury would not be enough to cover its spending plans .
even some government officials admit that taxes will have to go up again .
in a surprisingly candid interview last month vicky price , the new chief economic advisor to the department of trade and industry said : " the government may be about to embark on too much spending which it will not be able to finance .
the nhs , education and transport require so much money they will have to raise taxes . "
the ifs has also pointed out that mr brown 's health spending plans cover five years , but the government has only set out three years of tax rises , implying a potential " black hole " in the government 's finances after 2005/06 .
conflict with europe the spending review may cause further complications over any future plans to take britain into the euro .
the european commission has attacked the government 's spending plans on several previous occasions for breaching the eu growth and stability pact , which set a limit of 3 % of gdp on government borrowing .
brown has his own rules on borrowing , but these take a much more relaxed view on so-called investment spending , allowing him to greatly boost government spending on roads , schools , and hospitals , while still claiming he is being cautious .

ray lockyer of milford haven wears a mobile phone-size transmitter unit on his belt which monitors his heart condition and communicates with hospital staff through the telephone network .
every night , the device sends heart information 500 miles to germany - where device manufacturer biotronik is based - and transmits sos messages back to morriston hospital , swansea .
it means grandfather and heart attack victim mr lockyer , 55 , need not make lengthy journeys for doctors to download health data on the spot and benefits from continual monitoring .
the keen gardener was forced to give up his work as a scaffolder due to a condition which sometimes causes his heart to vibrate violently .
but now he hopes the pacemaker , which acts as a defibrillator whenever it identifies trouble , can give him a new lease of life .
he is the first in the uk to be fitted with the device because wales ' wide-open spaces are thought to be the best environment to put the pacemaker through its paces .
' hollywood technology ' " it 's like someone is watching over my husband without being here , " his wife doreen told bbc news online .
" every night while we are sleeping , it sends the information .
if the doctors think anything is wrong , they will call up . "
the device even causes television interference when dialling up , just like a mobile phone . "

heart disease is one of the biggest killers in wales and health professionals suspect the device could prove beneficial .
a similar device tested in the us in march cut heart attacks in wearers by a third .
dr mark anderson , who has researched the transmitter thoroughly , said : " in the past , we had to physically see the patient to retrieve the information .
" if the patient thought something happened to them overnight they would have to come to the clinic to find out .
" many of our patients live 60 or 80 miles away from the clinic and it is hard to get regular information about their condition .
" now , through this new device , we can get a information without us seeing them .
" west wales is a very rural area - it has an excellent testing environment for this system . "
dr david cunningham , director of the national pacemaker and icd database , said the invention would help to reassure heart patients .
" it 's going to improve the communication between the patients and their cardiologists , " he said .
" that will make the patient feel better .
" reassurance is important for icd patients because they worry that they have this device inside them that can shock their hearts . "
