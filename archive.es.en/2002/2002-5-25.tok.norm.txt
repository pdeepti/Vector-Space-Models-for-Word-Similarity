they also pledged to increase cooperation in the war against terrorism .
" this is a historic and hopeful day for russia and america , " bush said as he started his first visit to moscow .
" president putin and i today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our two countries . "
he added that the agreement " liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility . "
at a ceremony in the kremlin 's gilded andreyevsky hall , the presidents formalized the first nuclear disarmament agreement between their countries since january 1993 .
the ceremony served as the centerpiece of a four-day summit that will also include a visit to putin 's hometown of st. petersburg .
massive cutbacks under the landmark treaty , the two sides plan to reduce their arsenals by around two-thirds .
the treaty is intended to reduce the number of warheads in russia and the u.s. from an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 today to about 1,700 to 2,200 warheads within a decade .
the deal came after the u.s. announced its withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in december .
that treaty precluded the u.s. from deploying a missile defense system it is seeking to build in order to protect itself from weapons of mass destruction .
" pootie-poot " and k street 's finest the treaty marks a new era of cooperation for the two nations .

bush , for his part , has nicknamed the leader of america 's cold war nemesis " pootie-poot . "
but the event also had more somber moments keeping in line with the historic magnitude of the occasion .
putin , who knows his cash-strapped country ca n't afford to maintain its cold war arsenal any longer , was more measured : " it is a decision taken by two countries on behalf of international security and strategic stability . "
critics of the treaty point out that under its terms , either side is allowed to store weapons for possible later use .
additionally , the treaty can be called off with three months notice from moscow or washington .
tension over iran the russian president also publicly clashed with bush over u.s. criticism of a russian program that is helping iran to build a nuclear power plant .
the bush adminstration worries that the nuclear plant could be converted to produce materials used in the construction of nuclear weapons .
" i 'd like to point out that cooperation between iran and russia is not of a character which would undermine the process of non-proliferation , " putin said .
" our cooperation is exclusively as regards to the energy sector focused on the problems of an economic nature . "
german government applauds treaty foreign minister joschka fischer greeted friday 's development , describing the agreement as a step in the path to a final disposal of the nuclear arsenal .

but the situation of the farmers providing them beans for their latte macchiatos remains miserable . it certainly took awhile .
starbucks opened 5,400 stores in north america , asia and the rest of europe before arriving in germany .
one has to wonder why .
germany is the second-largest importer of coffee behind the united states , according to the international coffee organization -lrb- ico -rrb- .
the consumption here is high and gradually rising , with some 74 billion cups drunk in 2001 – almost 1,000 cups per german per year .
" the chances for going into the market are very good right now , " hans georg müller , of the german coffee association told dw-world .
coffee bars and shops are booming in germany at the moment as part of a european-wide trend in coffee bars led initially by england .
" someone asked me a couple of years ago , ' isn ’ t there a stage of market saturation ?
this can ’ t go on , ' " said martin wattam , of the ico in london .
" but it doesn ’ t seem to have happened .
it just keeps on going on . "
there are currently 400 starbucks-style coffee bars in germany , but room for at least 1,000 , müller said .
current chains include cafetiero , caras and frazer coffee in frankfurt .
but their presence is relatively small and something starbucks can easily surpass with its plans to open up at least 180 other franchises in germany in the coming years .
" i think it ’ s good for the whole coffee shop market , " said müller , pointing to the chain ’ s recognition factor .
" it will give a kind of push to the market . "

they also pledged to increase cooperation in the war against terrorism .
" this is a historic and hopeful day for russia and america , " bush said as he started his first visit to moscow .
" president putin and i today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our two countries . "
he added that the agreement " liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility . "
at a ceremony in the kremlin 's gilded andreyevsky hall , the presidents formalized the first nuclear disarmament agreement between their countries since january 1993 .
the ceremony served as the centerpiece of a four-day summit that will also include a visit to putin 's hometown of st. petersburg .
massive cutbacks under the landmark treaty , the two sides plan to reduce their arsenals by around two-thirds .
the treaty is intended to reduce the number of warheads in russia and the u.s. from an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 today to about 1,700 to 2,200 warheads within a decade .
the deal came after the u.s. announced its withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in december .
that treaty precluded the u.s. from deploying a missile defense system it is seeking to build in order to protect itself from weapons of mass destruction .
" pootie-poot " and k street 's finest the treaty marks a new era of cooperation for the two nations .
indeed , both bush and putin offered comedic exchanges during the signing ceremony .
the russian president , who is often regarded as stiff , joked that " the best lobbyist of the interests of u.s. companies is the american president standing here . "
bush , for his part , has nicknamed the leader of america 's cold war nemesis " pootie-poot . "
but the event also had more somber moments keeping in line with the historic magnitude of the occasion .
putin , who knows his cash-strapped country ca n't afford to maintain its cold war arsenal any longer , was more measured : " it is a decision taken by two countries on behalf of international security and strategic stability . "
critics of the treaty point out that under its terms , either side is allowed to store weapons for possible later use .
additionally , the treaty can be called off with three months notice from moscow or washington .
tension over iran the russian president also publicly clashed with bush over u.s. criticism of a russian program that is helping iran to build a nuclear power plant .
the bush adminstration worries that the nuclear plant could be converted to produce materials used in the construction of nuclear weapons .
" i 'd like to point out that cooperation between iran and russia is not of a character which would undermine the process of non-proliferation , " putin said .
" our cooperation is exclusively as regards to the energy sector focused on the problems of an economic nature . "
german government applauds treaty foreign minister joschka fischer greeted friday 's development , describing the agreement as a step in the path to a final disposal of the nuclear arsenal .

they also pledged to increase cooperation in the war against terrorism .
" this is a historic and hopeful day for russia and america , " bush said as he started his first visit to moscow .
" president putin and i today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our two countries . "
he added that the agreement " liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility . "
at a ceremony in the kremlin 's gilded andreyevsky hall , the presidents formalized the first nuclear disarmament agreement between their countries since january 1993 .
the ceremony served as the centerpiece of a four-day summit that will also include a visit to putin 's hometown of st. petersburg .
massive cutbacks under the landmark treaty , the two sides plan to reduce their arsenals by around two-thirds .
the treaty is intended to reduce the number of warheads in russia and the u.s. from an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 today to about 1,700 to 2,200 warheads within a decade .
the deal came after the u.s. announced its withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in december .
that treaty precluded the u.s. from deploying a missile defense system it is seeking to build in order to protect itself from weapons of mass destruction .
" pootie-poot " and k street 's finest the treaty marks a new era of cooperation for the two nations .
indeed , both bush and putin offered comedic exchanges during the signing ceremony .
the russian president , who is often regarded as stiff , joked that " the best lobbyist of the interests of u.s. companies is the american president standing here . "
bush , for his part , has nicknamed the leader of america 's cold war nemesis " pootie-poot . "
but the event also had more somber moments keeping in line with the historic magnitude of the occasion .
putin , who knows his cash-strapped country ca n't afford to maintain its cold war arsenal any longer , was more measured : " it is a decision taken by two countries on behalf of international security and strategic stability . "
critics of the treaty point out that under its terms , either side is allowed to store weapons for possible later use .
additionally , the treaty can be called off with three months notice from moscow or washington .
tension over iran the russian president also publicly clashed with bush over u.s. criticism of a russian program that is helping iran to build a nuclear power plant .
the bush adminstration worries that the nuclear plant could be converted to produce materials used in the construction of nuclear weapons .
" i 'd like to point out that cooperation between iran and russia is not of a character which would undermine the process of non-proliferation , " putin said .
" our cooperation is exclusively as regards to the energy sector focused on the problems of an economic nature . "
german government applauds treaty foreign minister joschka fischer greeted friday 's development , describing the agreement as a step in the path to a final disposal of the nuclear arsenal .
the government also called on the countries to decisively fight to eliminate the global danger that nuclear weapons represent .

more coffee bars aren ’ t likely to reduce that count , because the typical coffee bar latte or macchiato has a low concentration of beans .

coffee retailers can stay afloat because they roast the coffee and turn a cheap commodity into something valuable .
as a result , they have the freedom to mark up the prices when they begin selling the roasted beans .
coffee farmers see none of that money , said wattam in an interview with dw-world .

with inflation down 1.6 percent , unhappy shoppers continue to note rising prices since the demise of the mark . inflation has fallen in germany despite the fact that almost 90 percent of germans have complained of higher prices across the country since the european single currency was introduced .
this news comes at the same time as reports that the german economy grew 0.2 percent in the first three months of 2002 , mainly thanks to a strong rise in exports , the germany 's federal statistical office said .
financial analysts have come to the lower inflation figure through a bizarre testing process that polls 60,000 households across the country and takes the average cost of buying a cross section of products as an indication of general price .
these products range from every day items such as food and cleaning goods to cars and personal computers and are combined in a " warenkorb " , a metaphorical shopping basket .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : filling up the shopping cart at the market the price figures are then used to calculate the rate of inflation of consumer products , the result being that luxury goods appear to have dramatic reductions in price while increases in basic needs are negligible .
food price increases target the public pocket for those who fill their shopping trolleys at aldi with wide screen televisions , laptops and ferraris , this is undoubtedly good news .
however , for the majority of us who have to survive on old fashioned food and drink , things are not so rosy .
the harsh realities of the increasing prices are more visible when viewed as actual money in the hand or purse .
anyone raising their eyebrows at fruit and vegetable prices over the past six months have had their protestations answered with explanations concerning the harsh winter in spain and southern europe .
with the bad weather in europe 's market garden and the presumed inability to grow anything anywhere else on the continent , supermarkets have gladly raised prices in the face of this current consumer plight .
one irate customer questioned at kaiser 's supermarket in berlin earlier in the year remarked that his zucchini was almost four times more expensive than before the currency changeover .
he was now paying two euro for each vegetable compared to 99 pfennig or about half a euro .
service industry suspected of taking advantage food stuffs are not the only area of consumption to be affected .
the main culprits tend to be those working in the service industry .
it seems that the beatles were almost right when they warned in their ' taxman ' song that the government official in question would ' tax your feet ' .
german shoe repairers have taken full advantage of the euro changeover by upping the price of people 's replacement soles by 2.6 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hair-raising effect of euro prices other specialists such as barbers and hairdressers have been called to task over the hair-raising 30 percent increase in styling fees .
customers visiting bars , restaurants and hotels throughout germany have also been hit by the rising prices , but their confusion may be attributed to the availability of alcohol in these establishments .
tax , rent and bills to blame - not euro although the government 's statistics department have denied the fact , consumers have consistently proved that the euro has made things more expensive .
the german federal bank added more fuel to the fire in their monthly report for january which said that since the deutsch mark had vanished from circulation – the last day to use it was february 28 – there are some indications that at least a few storeowners have used the confusion over the new money to push up prices .
sensitive to the fact that the public might associate higher prices with the currency changeover , eurozone government ministers have not blamed the euro , but rather taxes , rents and energy costs .
unscrupulous shop keepers were not mentioned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's official : euro makes things expensive bars , hotels and the barber are just a few of the things that got more expensive when germany switched from the deutsch mark to the euro .

coffee retailers can stay afloat because they roast the coffee and turn a cheap commodity into something valuable .

they also pledged to increase cooperation in the war against terrorism .
" this is a historic and hopeful day for russia and america , " bush said as he started his first visit to moscow .
" president putin and i today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our two countries . "
he added that the agreement " liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility . "
at a ceremony in the kremlin 's gilded andreyevsky hall , the presidents formalized the first nuclear disarmament agreement between their countries since january 1993 .
the ceremony served as the centerpiece of a four-day summit that will also include a visit to putin 's hometown of st. petersburg .
massive cutbacks under the landmark treaty , the two sides plan to reduce their arsenals by around two-thirds .
the treaty is intended to reduce the number of warheads in russia and the u.s. from an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 today to about 1,700 to 2,200 warheads within a decade .
the deal came after the u.s. announced its withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in december .
that treaty precluded the u.s. from deploying a missile defense system it is seeking to build in order to protect itself from weapons of mass destruction .
" pootie-poot " and k street 's finest the treaty marks a new era of cooperation for the two nations .
indeed , both bush and putin offered comedic exchanges during the signing ceremony .

bush , for his part , has nicknamed the leader of america 's cold war nemesis " pootie-poot . "
but the event also had more somber moments keeping in line with the historic magnitude of the occasion .
putin , who knows his cash-strapped country ca n't afford to maintain its cold war arsenal any longer , was more measured : " it is a decision taken by two countries on behalf of international security and strategic stability . "
critics of the treaty point out that under its terms , either side is allowed to store weapons for possible later use .
additionally , the treaty can be called off with three months notice from moscow or washington .
tension over iran the russian president also publicly clashed with bush over u.s. criticism of a russian program that is helping iran to build a nuclear power plant .
the bush adminstration worries that the nuclear plant could be converted to produce materials used in the construction of nuclear weapons .
" i 'd like to point out that cooperation between iran and russia is not of a character which would undermine the process of non-proliferation , " putin said .
" our cooperation is exclusively as regards to the energy sector focused on the problems of an economic nature . "
german government applauds treaty foreign minister joschka fischer greeted friday 's development , describing the agreement as a step in the path to a final disposal of the nuclear arsenal .
the government also called on the countries to decisively fight to eliminate the global danger that nuclear weapons represent .

but the situation of the farmers providing them beans for their latte macchiatos remains miserable . it certainly took awhile .
starbucks opened 5,400 stores in north america , asia and the rest of europe before arriving in germany .
one has to wonder why .
germany is the second-largest importer of coffee behind the united states , according to the international coffee organization -lrb- ico -rrb- .
the consumption here is high and gradually rising , with some 74 billion cups drunk in 2001 – almost 1,000 cups per german per year .
" the chances for going into the market are very good right now , " hans georg müller , of the german coffee association told dw-world .
coffee bars and shops are booming in germany at the moment as part of a european-wide trend in coffee bars led initially by england .
" someone asked me a couple of years ago , ' isn ’ t there a stage of market saturation ?
this can ’ t go on , ' " said martin wattam , of the ico in london .
" but it doesn ’ t seem to have happened .
it just keeps on going on . "
there are currently 400 starbucks-style coffee bars in germany , but room for at least 1,000 , müller said .
current chains include cafetiero , caras and frazer coffee in frankfurt .
but their presence is relatively small and something starbucks can easily surpass with its plans to open up at least 180 other franchises in germany in the coming years .
" i think it ’ s good for the whole coffee shop market , " said müller , pointing to the chain ’ s recognition factor .
" it will give a kind of push to the market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee beans farmers losing out in coffee bar boom farmers in africa , asia and latin america hit hard by the reduced demand for coffee worldwide are likely to disagree .
there is a current surplus of 10 million bags of coffee on the market .
more coffee bars aren ’ t likely to reduce that count , because the typical coffee bar latte or macchiato has a low concentration of beans .
" it ’ s just a shot of espresso and a lot of milk , " said wattam .
coffee retailers can stay afloat because they roast the coffee and turn a cheap commodity into something valuable .
as a result , they have the freedom to mark up the prices when they begin selling the roasted beans .
coffee farmers see none of that money , said wattam in an interview with dw-world .
less financial incentive means less of an effort to produce quality beans which explains why at least five percent of the coffee currently on the international market is of poor quality .
reversing the downturn wattam ’ s organization hopes to reverse that trend by simply eliminating that five percent from the market .
to help the farmers survive , the organization is encouraging diversification in farming and introducing ad campaigns in countries such as india to increase domestic demand for a domestic product , wattam said .
" one can ’ t stress enough the point of having a stable market , " he said .
" it ’ s not like we want farmers driving around in rolls royces , it ’ s a question of prices .
it ’ s about sustainability and having a sustainable existence .

the barista -lrb- an overly fancy word for the person who makes coffee and takes your money -rrb- called and called .
but no body came .
the coffee buyers and starbucks rookies stared dumbly at their receipts .
was that a tall macchiato or a grande latte with peppermint syrup that i ordered ?
why isn ’ t anybody picking that up ?
is that mine ?
did that caramel macchiato really cost € 4.30 ?
the baristas weren ’ t on top of things either .
chaos was the rule of the morning behind the counter as the first-ever starbucks opened its doors in the very hip , very upwardly mobile heart of germany 's capital city .
press had been invited to the location on rosenthaler strasse in berlin ’ s mitte district friday night to celebrate the opening with execs from starbucks and their german partner karstadtquelle .
outside , the next day ’ s potential customers gazed through the coffee shop ’ s large street-front windows , getting a peek of the couch and wooden table interior americans , asians and brits have grown accustomed to over the past decade .
after launching more than 5,000 stores in asia and the rest of europe , the world ’ s largest coffee chain finally decided it was time to conquer the " kaffee and kuchen " coffee culture of germany .

after all , this was one of america ’ s greatest exports in a neighborhood filled with hip berliners who cherished their slices of americana – even if they didn ’ t always admit to it .
starbucks coffee house imitators had already opened shop near rosenthaler strasse and other streets in the mitte district in the past few years .
their counters had a steady stream of young professionals grabbing a latte to go – complete with the cardboard sleeve that guarded against cup burn and potential lawsuits .
now those same experienced professionals were lined up at the starbucks counter , gazing at the myriad of choices a single cup of coffee offered .
brochures explaining each drink were available and the green-aproned , black polo shirted starbucks crew was always helpful with suggestions .
i ordered a caramel macchiato for the first time in my life .
it was the kind of drink my friends and i always made fun of back in san francisco .
macchiato ?
syrup shots ?

they also pledged to increase cooperation in the war against terrorism .
" this is a historic and hopeful day for russia and america , " bush said as he started his first visit to moscow .
" president putin and i today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our two countries . "
he added that the agreement " liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility . "
at a ceremony in the kremlin 's gilded andreyevsky hall , the presidents formalized the first nuclear disarmament agreement between their countries since january 1993 .
the ceremony served as the centerpiece of a four-day summit that will also include a visit to putin 's hometown of st. petersburg .
massive cutbacks under the landmark treaty , the two sides plan to reduce their arsenals by around two-thirds .
the treaty is intended to reduce the number of warheads in russia and the u.s. from an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 today to about 1,700 to 2,200 warheads within a decade .
the deal came after the u.s. announced its withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in december .
that treaty precluded the u.s. from deploying a missile defense system it is seeking to build in order to protect itself from weapons of mass destruction .
" pootie-poot " and k street 's finest the treaty marks a new era of cooperation for the two nations .
indeed , both bush and putin offered comedic exchanges during the signing ceremony .
the russian president , who is often regarded as stiff , joked that " the best lobbyist of the interests of u.s. companies is the american president standing here . "
bush , for his part , has nicknamed the leader of america 's cold war nemesis " pootie-poot . "
but the event also had more somber moments keeping in line with the historic magnitude of the occasion .
putin , who knows his cash-strapped country ca n't afford to maintain its cold war arsenal any longer , was more measured : " it is a decision taken by two countries on behalf of international security and strategic stability . "
critics of the treaty point out that under its terms , either side is allowed to store weapons for possible later use .
additionally , the treaty can be called off with three months notice from moscow or washington .
tension over iran the russian president also publicly clashed with bush over u.s. criticism of a russian program that is helping iran to build a nuclear power plant .
the bush adminstration worries that the nuclear plant could be converted to produce materials used in the construction of nuclear weapons .
" i 'd like to point out that cooperation between iran and russia is not of a character which would undermine the process of non-proliferation , " putin said .
" our cooperation is exclusively as regards to the energy sector focused on the problems of an economic nature . "
german government applauds treaty foreign minister joschka fischer greeted friday 's development , describing the agreement as a step in the path to a final disposal of the nuclear arsenal .
the government also called on the countries to decisively fight to eliminate the global danger that nuclear weapons represent .
after visiting with putin , president bush will fly on to france for meetings with recently re-elected president jacques chirac . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and putin : comrades in arms ?

but the situation of the farmers providing them beans for their latte macchiatos remains miserable . it certainly took awhile .
starbucks opened 5,400 stores in north america , asia and the rest of europe before arriving in germany .
one has to wonder why .
germany is the second-largest importer of coffee behind the united states , according to the international coffee organization -lrb- ico -rrb- .
the consumption here is high and gradually rising , with some 74 billion cups drunk in 2001 – almost 1,000 cups per german per year .
" the chances for going into the market are very good right now , " hans georg müller , of the german coffee association told dw-world .
coffee bars and shops are booming in germany at the moment as part of a european-wide trend in coffee bars led initially by england .
" someone asked me a couple of years ago , ' isn ’ t there a stage of market saturation ?
this can ’ t go on , ' " said martin wattam , of the ico in london .
" but it doesn ’ t seem to have happened .
it just keeps on going on . "
there are currently 400 starbucks-style coffee bars in germany , but room for at least 1,000 , müller said .
current chains include cafetiero , caras and frazer coffee in frankfurt .
but their presence is relatively small and something starbucks can easily surpass with its plans to open up at least 180 other franchises in germany in the coming years .
" i think it ’ s good for the whole coffee shop market , " said müller , pointing to the chain ’ s recognition factor .
" it will give a kind of push to the market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee beans farmers losing out in coffee bar boom farmers in africa , asia and latin america hit hard by the reduced demand for coffee worldwide are likely to disagree .
there is a current surplus of 10 million bags of coffee on the market .
more coffee bars aren ’ t likely to reduce that count , because the typical coffee bar latte or macchiato has a low concentration of beans .
" it ’ s just a shot of espresso and a lot of milk , " said wattam .
coffee retailers can stay afloat because they roast the coffee and turn a cheap commodity into something valuable .
as a result , they have the freedom to mark up the prices when they begin selling the roasted beans .
coffee farmers see none of that money , said wattam in an interview with dw-world .
less financial incentive means less of an effort to produce quality beans which explains why at least five percent of the coffee currently on the international market is of poor quality .
reversing the downturn wattam ’ s organization hopes to reverse that trend by simply eliminating that five percent from the market .
to help the farmers survive , the organization is encouraging diversification in farming and introducing ad campaigns in countries such as india to increase domestic demand for a domestic product , wattam said .
" one can ’ t stress enough the point of having a stable market , " he said .
" it ’ s not like we want farmers driving around in rolls royces , it ’ s a question of prices .
it ’ s about sustainability and having a sustainable existence .

but it 's best not to tinker on the path to global domination . the tall mocha sat unclaimed for what seemed like hours .
the barista -lrb- an overly fancy word for the person who makes coffee and takes your money -rrb- called and called .
but no body came .
the coffee buyers and starbucks rookies stared dumbly at their receipts .
was that a tall macchiato or a grande latte with peppermint syrup that i ordered ?
why isn ’ t anybody picking that up ?
is that mine ?
did that caramel macchiato really cost € 4.30 ?
the baristas weren ’ t on top of things either .
chaos was the rule of the morning behind the counter as the first-ever starbucks opened its doors in the very hip , very upwardly mobile heart of germany 's capital city .
press had been invited to the location on rosenthaler strasse in berlin ’ s mitte district friday night to celebrate the opening with execs from starbucks and their german partner karstadtquelle .
outside , the next day ’ s potential customers gazed through the coffee shop ’ s large street-front windows , getting a peek of the couch and wooden table interior americans , asians and brits have grown accustomed to over the past decade .
after launching more than 5,000 stores in asia and the rest of europe , the world ’ s largest coffee chain finally decided it was time to conquer the " kaffee and kuchen " coffee culture of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first starbucks coffee house in germany at the " hackesche höfe " in berlin an american at home abroad there was a fat line when i rolled into starbucks just before midday saturday .
after all , this was one of america ’ s greatest exports in a neighborhood filled with hip berliners who cherished their slices of americana – even if they didn ’ t always admit to it .
starbucks coffee house imitators had already opened shop near rosenthaler strasse and other streets in the mitte district in the past few years .
their counters had a steady stream of young professionals grabbing a latte to go – complete with the cardboard sleeve that guarded against cup burn and potential lawsuits .
now those same experienced professionals were lined up at the starbucks counter , gazing at the myriad of choices a single cup of coffee offered .
brochures explaining each drink were available and the green-aproned , black polo shirted starbucks crew was always helpful with suggestions .
i ordered a caramel macchiato for the first time in my life .
it was the kind of drink my friends and i always made fun of back in san francisco .
macchiato ?
syrup shots ?
just give me a damn cup of coffee .
besides , our loyalty , and we liked to think , the rest of the bay area ’ s , was to starbucks ' competitor peets coffee .
you could paint entire houses and pave sidewalks on the jolt a large mocca from peets gave you , your hands shivering like a junkie ’ s all the way .
when a starbucks opened up down the street from our beloved peets , we booed and hissed .
so artificial , so cold , so , so ... green .
i moved away from all of that when i came to berlin .
sitting down to a civilized cup of coffee was charming and european , and the quality was fantastic .
but the germans still had a lot to learn when it came to coffee on the go .
the small plastic cups burned the hands and the taste left something , well , a lot , to be desired .
now starbucks is here , ostensibly to teach them that .
the little cups with the green mermaid logo will pepper trash cans throughout berlin in the coming year , when as many as five more franchises open up in the capital city .
but the one on rosenthaler strasse will be the test run .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside view of the first starbucks coffee house in germany to their credit , the starbucks people have done nothing to make the first german chain any more special .
the couches are the same shades of brown and burgundy as in okinawa and fort lauderdale .
the loudspeakers loop out old jazz and light soul jams -lrb- aretha franklin , james brown , nothing too risky , of course -rrb- .
the walls are covered with tinted or black and white photographs of street scapes or architecture – none of which are distinctly german .
seattle style sells hell , starbucks is conquering the rest of the world without looking any different than the inagural store in seattle .
why should germany be any different ?
" i like it because it ’ s the same everywhere , " said alexandra pioretzki , a 24-year-old student from nuremberg who still has fond memories of her first starbucks cappucino on the banks of lake michigan in chicago .
since then , she ’ s visited starbucks coffee bars in switzerland and asia .
" for me , it ’ s a bit of this world feeling , " she said .
" it ’ s home , but in the sense that my home is the world . "
the franchise will have no problem attracting globe-trotting young germans like pioretzki .
it ’ s the older generations , who are used to just getting a damn cup of coffee , that will be harder to pull in .
for now , the rosenthaler shop doesn ’ t need to worry about all that .
the comfy chairs and wooden tables on both levels of the two-level cafe were packed saturday .
many will come back again and again , and out-of-towners , like pioretski , will eagerly await the opening of franchises in their home town .

but the situation of the farmers providing them beans for their latte macchiatos remains miserable . it certainly took awhile .
starbucks opened 5,400 stores in north america , asia and the rest of europe before arriving in germany .
one has to wonder why .
germany is the second-largest importer of coffee behind the united states , according to the international coffee organization -lrb- ico -rrb- .
the consumption here is high and gradually rising , with some 74 billion cups drunk in 2001 – almost 1,000 cups per german per year .
" the chances for going into the market are very good right now , " hans georg müller , of the german coffee association told dw-world .
coffee bars and shops are booming in germany at the moment as part of a european-wide trend in coffee bars led initially by england .
" someone asked me a couple of years ago , ' isn ’ t there a stage of market saturation ?
this can ’ t go on , ' " said martin wattam , of the ico in london .
" but it doesn ’ t seem to have happened .
it just keeps on going on . "
there are currently 400 starbucks-style coffee bars in germany , but room for at least 1,000 , müller said .
current chains include cafetiero , caras and frazer coffee in frankfurt .
but their presence is relatively small and something starbucks can easily surpass with its plans to open up at least 180 other franchises in germany in the coming years .
" i think it ’ s good for the whole coffee shop market , " said müller , pointing to the chain ’ s recognition factor .
" it will give a kind of push to the market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee beans farmers losing out in coffee bar boom farmers in africa , asia and latin america hit hard by the reduced demand for coffee worldwide are likely to disagree .
there is a current surplus of 10 million bags of coffee on the market .
more coffee bars aren ’ t likely to reduce that count , because the typical coffee bar latte or macchiato has a low concentration of beans .
" it ’ s just a shot of espresso and a lot of milk , " said wattam .
coffee retailers can stay afloat because they roast the coffee and turn a cheap commodity into something valuable .
as a result , they have the freedom to mark up the prices when they begin selling the roasted beans .
coffee farmers see none of that money , said wattam in an interview with dw-world .
less financial incentive means less of an effort to produce quality beans which explains why at least five percent of the coffee currently on the international market is of poor quality .
reversing the downturn wattam ’ s organization hopes to reverse that trend by simply eliminating that five percent from the market .
to help the farmers survive , the organization is encouraging diversification in farming and introducing ad campaigns in countries such as india to increase domestic demand for a domestic product , wattam said .
" one can ’ t stress enough the point of having a stable market , " he said .
" it ’ s not like we want farmers driving around in rolls royces , it ’ s a question of prices .
it ’ s about sustainability and having a sustainable existence .

they also pledged to increase cooperation in the war against terrorism .
" this is a historic and hopeful day for russia and america , " bush said as he started his first visit to moscow .
" president putin and i today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our two countries . "
he added that the agreement " liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility . "
at a ceremony in the kremlin 's gilded andreyevsky hall , the presidents formalized the first nuclear disarmament agreement between their countries since january 1993 .
the ceremony served as the centerpiece of a four-day summit that will also include a visit to putin 's hometown of st. petersburg .
massive cutbacks under the landmark treaty , the two sides plan to reduce their arsenals by around two-thirds .
the treaty is intended to reduce the number of warheads in russia and the u.s. from an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 today to about 1,700 to 2,200 warheads within a decade .
the deal came after the u.s. announced its withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in december .

putin , who knows his cash-strapped country ca n't afford to maintain its cold war arsenal any longer , was more measured : " it is a decision taken by two countries on behalf of international security and strategic stability . "
critics of the treaty point out that under its terms , either side is allowed to store weapons for possible later use .
additionally , the treaty can be called off with three months notice from moscow or washington .

chaos was the rule of the morning behind the counter as the first-ever starbucks opened its doors in the very hip , very upwardly mobile heart of germany 's capital city .
press had been invited to the location on rosenthaler strasse in berlin ’ s mitte district friday night to celebrate the opening with execs from starbucks and their german partner karstadtquelle .
outside , the next day ’ s potential customers gazed through the coffee shop ’ s large street-front windows , getting a peek of the couch and wooden table interior americans , asians and brits have grown accustomed to over the past decade .
after launching more than 5,000 stores in asia and the rest of europe , the world ’ s largest coffee chain finally decided it was time to conquer the " kaffee and kuchen " coffee culture of germany .

after all , this was one of america ’ s greatest exports in a neighborhood filled with hip berliners who cherished their slices of americana – even if they didn ’ t always admit to it .
starbucks coffee house imitators had already opened shop near rosenthaler strasse and other streets in the mitte district in the past few years .
their counters had a steady stream of young professionals grabbing a latte to go – complete with the cardboard sleeve that guarded against cup burn and potential lawsuits .
now those same experienced professionals were lined up at the starbucks counter , gazing at the myriad of choices a single cup of coffee offered .
brochures explaining each drink were available and the green-aproned , black polo shirted starbucks crew was always helpful with suggestions .

i moved away from all of that when i came to berlin .
sitting down to a civilized cup of coffee was charming and european , and the quality was fantastic .
but the germans still had a lot to learn when it came to coffee on the go .
the small plastic cups burned the hands and the taste left something , well , a lot , to be desired .
now starbucks is here , ostensibly to teach them that .
the little cups with the green mermaid logo will pepper trash cans throughout berlin in the coming year , when as many as five more franchises open up in the capital city .
but the one on rosenthaler strasse will be the test run .

" i like it because it ’ s the same everywhere , " said alexandra pioretzki , a 24-year-old student from nuremberg who still has fond memories of her first starbucks cappucino on the banks of lake michigan in chicago .
since then , she ’ s visited starbucks coffee bars in switzerland and asia .
" for me , it ’ s a bit of this world feeling , " she said .
" it ’ s home , but in the sense that my home is the world . "
the franchise will have no problem attracting globe-trotting young germans like pioretzki .
it ’ s the older generations , who are used to just getting a damn cup of coffee , that will be harder to pull in .
for now , the rosenthaler shop doesn ’ t need to worry about all that .
the comfy chairs and wooden tables on both levels of the two-level cafe were packed saturday .

but the situation of the farmers providing them beans for their latte macchiatos remains miserable . it certainly took awhile .
starbucks opened 5,400 stores in north america , asia and the rest of europe before arriving in germany .
one has to wonder why .
germany is the second-largest importer of coffee behind the united states , according to the international coffee organization -lrb- ico -rrb- .
the consumption here is high and gradually rising , with some 74 billion cups drunk in 2001 – almost 1,000 cups per german per year .
" the chances for going into the market are very good right now , " hans georg müller , of the german coffee association told dw-world .
coffee bars and shops are booming in germany at the moment as part of a european-wide trend in coffee bars led initially by england .
" someone asked me a couple of years ago , ' isn ’ t there a stage of market saturation ?
this can ’ t go on , ' " said martin wattam , of the ico in london .
" but it doesn ’ t seem to have happened .
it just keeps on going on . "
there are currently 400 starbucks-style coffee bars in germany , but room for at least 1,000 , müller said .
current chains include cafetiero , caras and frazer coffee in frankfurt .
but their presence is relatively small and something starbucks can easily surpass with its plans to open up at least 180 other franchises in germany in the coming years .
" i think it ’ s good for the whole coffee shop market , " said müller , pointing to the chain ’ s recognition factor .
" it will give a kind of push to the market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee beans farmers losing out in coffee bar boom farmers in africa , asia and latin america hit hard by the reduced demand for coffee worldwide are likely to disagree .
there is a current surplus of 10 million bags of coffee on the market .
more coffee bars aren ’ t likely to reduce that count , because the typical coffee bar latte or macchiato has a low concentration of beans .
" it ’ s just a shot of espresso and a lot of milk , " said wattam .
coffee retailers can stay afloat because they roast the coffee and turn a cheap commodity into something valuable .
as a result , they have the freedom to mark up the prices when they begin selling the roasted beans .
coffee farmers see none of that money , said wattam in an interview with dw-world .
less financial incentive means less of an effort to produce quality beans which explains why at least five percent of the coffee currently on the international market is of poor quality .
reversing the downturn wattam ’ s organization hopes to reverse that trend by simply eliminating that five percent from the market .
to help the farmers survive , the organization is encouraging diversification in farming and introducing ad campaigns in countries such as india to increase domestic demand for a domestic product , wattam said .
" one can ’ t stress enough the point of having a stable market , " he said .
" it ’ s not like we want farmers driving around in rolls royces , it ’ s a question of prices .

the consumption here is high and gradually rising , with some 74 billion cups drunk in 2001 – almost 1,000 cups per german per year .
" the chances for going into the market are very good right now , " hans georg müller , of the german coffee association told dw-world .
coffee bars and shops are booming in germany at the moment as part of a european-wide trend in coffee bars led initially by england .
" someone asked me a couple of years ago , ' isn ’ t there a stage of market saturation ?
this can ’ t go on , ' " said martin wattam , of the ico in london .
" but it doesn ’ t seem to have happened .
it just keeps on going on . "
there are currently 400 starbucks-style coffee bars in germany , but room for at least 1,000 , müller said .
current chains include cafetiero , caras and frazer coffee in frankfurt .
but their presence is relatively small and something starbucks can easily surpass with its plans to open up at least 180 other franchises in germany in the coming years .
" i think it ’ s good for the whole coffee shop market , " said müller , pointing to the chain ’ s recognition factor .
" it will give a kind of push to the market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee beans farmers losing out in coffee bar boom farmers in africa , asia and latin america hit hard by the reduced demand for coffee worldwide are likely to disagree .
there is a current surplus of 10 million bags of coffee on the market .
more coffee bars aren ’ t likely to reduce that count , because the typical coffee bar latte or macchiato has a low concentration of beans .
" it ’ s just a shot of espresso and a lot of milk , " said wattam .
coffee retailers can stay afloat because they roast the coffee and turn a cheap commodity into something valuable .
as a result , they have the freedom to mark up the prices when they begin selling the roasted beans .
coffee farmers see none of that money , said wattam in an interview with dw-world .
less financial incentive means less of an effort to produce quality beans which explains why at least five percent of the coffee currently on the international market is of poor quality .
reversing the downturn wattam ’ s organization hopes to reverse that trend by simply eliminating that five percent from the market .
to help the farmers survive , the organization is encouraging diversification in farming and introducing ad campaigns in countries such as india to increase domestic demand for a domestic product , wattam said .
" one can ’ t stress enough the point of having a stable market , " he said .
" it ’ s not like we want farmers driving around in rolls royces , it ’ s a question of prices .
it ’ s about sustainability and having a sustainable existence .

but it 's best not to tinker on the path to global domination . the tall mocha sat unclaimed for what seemed like hours .
the barista -lrb- an overly fancy word for the person who makes coffee and takes your money -rrb- called and called .
but no body came .
the coffee buyers and starbucks rookies stared dumbly at their receipts .
was that a tall macchiato or a grande latte with peppermint syrup that i ordered ?
why isn ’ t anybody picking that up ?
is that mine ?
did that caramel macchiato really cost € 4.30 ?
the baristas weren ’ t on top of things either .
chaos was the rule of the morning behind the counter as the first-ever starbucks opened its doors in the very hip , very upwardly mobile heart of germany 's capital city .
press had been invited to the location on rosenthaler strasse in berlin ’ s mitte district friday night to celebrate the opening with execs from starbucks and their german partner karstadtquelle .
outside , the next day ’ s potential customers gazed through the coffee shop ’ s large street-front windows , getting a peek of the couch and wooden table interior americans , asians and brits have grown accustomed to over the past decade .
after launching more than 5,000 stores in asia and the rest of europe , the world ’ s largest coffee chain finally decided it was time to conquer the " kaffee and kuchen " coffee culture of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first starbucks coffee house in germany at the " hackesche höfe " in berlin an american at home abroad there was a fat line when i rolled into starbucks just before midday saturday .
after all , this was one of america ’ s greatest exports in a neighborhood filled with hip berliners who cherished their slices of americana – even if they didn ’ t always admit to it .
starbucks coffee house imitators had already opened shop near rosenthaler strasse and other streets in the mitte district in the past few years .
their counters had a steady stream of young professionals grabbing a latte to go – complete with the cardboard sleeve that guarded against cup burn and potential lawsuits .
now those same experienced professionals were lined up at the starbucks counter , gazing at the myriad of choices a single cup of coffee offered .
brochures explaining each drink were available and the green-aproned , black polo shirted starbucks crew was always helpful with suggestions .
i ordered a caramel macchiato for the first time in my life .
it was the kind of drink my friends and i always made fun of back in san francisco .
macchiato ?
syrup shots ?
just give me a damn cup of coffee .
besides , our loyalty , and we liked to think , the rest of the bay area ’ s , was to starbucks ' competitor peets coffee .
you could paint entire houses and pave sidewalks on the jolt a large mocca from peets gave you , your hands shivering like a junkie ’ s all the way .
when a starbucks opened up down the street from our beloved peets , we booed and hissed .
so artificial , so cold , so , so ... green .
i moved away from all of that when i came to berlin .
sitting down to a civilized cup of coffee was charming and european , and the quality was fantastic .
but the germans still had a lot to learn when it came to coffee on the go .
the small plastic cups burned the hands and the taste left something , well , a lot , to be desired .
now starbucks is here , ostensibly to teach them that .
the little cups with the green mermaid logo will pepper trash cans throughout berlin in the coming year , when as many as five more franchises open up in the capital city .
but the one on rosenthaler strasse will be the test run .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside view of the first starbucks coffee house in germany to their credit , the starbucks people have done nothing to make the first german chain any more special .
the couches are the same shades of brown and burgundy as in okinawa and fort lauderdale .
the loudspeakers loop out old jazz and light soul jams -lrb- aretha franklin , james brown , nothing too risky , of course -rrb- .
the walls are covered with tinted or black and white photographs of street scapes or architecture – none of which are distinctly german .
seattle style sells hell , starbucks is conquering the rest of the world without looking any different than the inagural store in seattle .
why should germany be any different ?
" i like it because it ’ s the same everywhere , " said alexandra pioretzki , a 24-year-old student from nuremberg who still has fond memories of her first starbucks cappucino on the banks of lake michigan in chicago .
since then , she ’ s visited starbucks coffee bars in switzerland and asia .
" for me , it ’ s a bit of this world feeling , " she said .
" it ’ s home , but in the sense that my home is the world . "
the franchise will have no problem attracting globe-trotting young germans like pioretzki .
it ’ s the older generations , who are used to just getting a damn cup of coffee , that will be harder to pull in .
for now , the rosenthaler shop doesn ’ t need to worry about all that .
the comfy chairs and wooden tables on both levels of the two-level cafe were packed saturday .
many will come back again and again , and out-of-towners , like pioretski , will eagerly await the opening of franchises in their home town .

they also pledged to increase cooperation in the war against terrorism .
" this is a historic and hopeful day for russia and america , " bush said as he started his first visit to moscow .
" president putin and i today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our two countries . "
he added that the agreement " liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility . "
at a ceremony in the kremlin 's gilded andreyevsky hall , the presidents formalized the first nuclear disarmament agreement between their countries since january 1993 .
the ceremony served as the centerpiece of a four-day summit that will also include a visit to putin 's hometown of st. petersburg .
massive cutbacks under the landmark treaty , the two sides plan to reduce their arsenals by around two-thirds .
the treaty is intended to reduce the number of warheads in russia and the u.s. from an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 today to about 1,700 to 2,200 warheads within a decade .
the deal came after the u.s. announced its withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in december .
that treaty precluded the u.s. from deploying a missile defense system it is seeking to build in order to protect itself from weapons of mass destruction .
" pootie-poot " and k street 's finest the treaty marks a new era of cooperation for the two nations .
indeed , both bush and putin offered comedic exchanges during the signing ceremony .
the russian president , who is often regarded as stiff , joked that " the best lobbyist of the interests of u.s. companies is the american president standing here . "
bush , for his part , has nicknamed the leader of america 's cold war nemesis " pootie-poot . "
but the event also had more somber moments keeping in line with the historic magnitude of the occasion .
putin , who knows his cash-strapped country ca n't afford to maintain its cold war arsenal any longer , was more measured : " it is a decision taken by two countries on behalf of international security and strategic stability . "
critics of the treaty point out that under its terms , either side is allowed to store weapons for possible later use .
additionally , the treaty can be called off with three months notice from moscow or washington .
tension over iran the russian president also publicly clashed with bush over u.s. criticism of a russian program that is helping iran to build a nuclear power plant .
the bush adminstration worries that the nuclear plant could be converted to produce materials used in the construction of nuclear weapons .
" i 'd like to point out that cooperation between iran and russia is not of a character which would undermine the process of non-proliferation , " putin said .
" our cooperation is exclusively as regards to the energy sector focused on the problems of an economic nature . "
german government applauds treaty foreign minister joschka fischer greeted friday 's development , describing the agreement as a step in the path to a final disposal of the nuclear arsenal .
the government also called on the countries to decisively fight to eliminate the global danger that nuclear weapons represent .
after visiting with putin , president bush will fly on to france for meetings with recently re-elected president jacques chirac . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and putin : comrades in arms ?
the american and russian presidents plan to sign a major nuclear treaty on friday , but critics say loopholes allowing both sides to store the warheads could water down future international nonproliferation efforts .
-lrb- may 24 , 2002 -rrb- binding treaty , but not for all a new treaty between the us and russia to reduce nuclear arsenals , has been termed by both sides as a breakthrough .
but the pact still leaves the us to deploy and refit warheads in reserve as they wish .

they also pledged to increase cooperation in the war against terrorism .
" this is a historic and hopeful day for russia and america , " bush said as he started his first visit to moscow .
" president putin and i today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our two countries . "
he added that the agreement " liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility . "
at a ceremony in the kremlin 's gilded andreyevsky hall , the presidents formalized the first nuclear disarmament agreement between their countries since january 1993 .
the ceremony served as the centerpiece of a four-day summit that will also include a visit to putin 's hometown of st. petersburg .
massive cutbacks under the landmark treaty , the two sides plan to reduce their arsenals by around two-thirds .
the treaty is intended to reduce the number of warheads in russia and the u.s. from an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 today to about 1,700 to 2,200 warheads within a decade .
the deal came after the u.s. announced its withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in december .
that treaty precluded the u.s. from deploying a missile defense system it is seeking to build in order to protect itself from weapons of mass destruction .
" pootie-poot " and k street 's finest the treaty marks a new era of cooperation for the two nations .
indeed , both bush and putin offered comedic exchanges during the signing ceremony .
the russian president , who is often regarded as stiff , joked that " the best lobbyist of the interests of u.s. companies is the american president standing here . "
bush , for his part , has nicknamed the leader of america 's cold war nemesis " pootie-poot . "
but the event also had more somber moments keeping in line with the historic magnitude of the occasion .
putin , who knows his cash-strapped country ca n't afford to maintain its cold war arsenal any longer , was more measured : " it is a decision taken by two countries on behalf of international security and strategic stability . "
critics of the treaty point out that under its terms , either side is allowed to store weapons for possible later use .
additionally , the treaty can be called off with three months notice from moscow or washington .
tension over iran the russian president also publicly clashed with bush over u.s. criticism of a russian program that is helping iran to build a nuclear power plant .
the bush adminstration worries that the nuclear plant could be converted to produce materials used in the construction of nuclear weapons .
" i 'd like to point out that cooperation between iran and russia is not of a character which would undermine the process of non-proliferation , " putin said .
" our cooperation is exclusively as regards to the energy sector focused on the problems of an economic nature . "
german government applauds treaty foreign minister joschka fischer greeted friday 's development , describing the agreement as a step in the path to a final disposal of the nuclear arsenal .
the government also called on the countries to decisively fight to eliminate the global danger that nuclear weapons represent .
after visiting with putin , president bush will fly on to france for meetings with recently re-elected president jacques chirac . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and putin : comrades in arms ?
the american and russian presidents plan to sign a major nuclear treaty on friday , but critics say loopholes allowing both sides to store the warheads could water down future international nonproliferation efforts .
-lrb- may 24 , 2002 -rrb- binding treaty , but not for all a new treaty between the us and russia to reduce nuclear arsenals , has been termed by both sides as a breakthrough .
but the pact still leaves the us to deploy and refit warheads in reserve as they wish .

the loudspeakers loop out old jazz and light soul jams -lrb- aretha franklin , james brown , nothing too risky , of course -rrb- .
the walls are covered with tinted or black and white photographs of street scapes or architecture – none of which are distinctly german .
seattle style sells hell , starbucks is conquering the rest of the world without looking any different than the inagural store in seattle .
why should germany be any different ?
" i like it because it ’ s the same everywhere , " said alexandra pioretzki , a 24-year-old student from nuremberg who still has fond memories of her first starbucks cappucino on the banks of lake michigan in chicago .
since then , she ’ s visited starbucks coffee bars in switzerland and asia .
" for me , it ’ s a bit of this world feeling , " she said .
" it ’ s home , but in the sense that my home is the world . "
the franchise will have no problem attracting globe-trotting young germans like pioretzki .
it ’ s the older generations , who are used to just getting a damn cup of coffee , that will be harder to pull in .
for now , the rosenthaler shop doesn ’ t need to worry about all that .
the comfy chairs and wooden tables on both levels of the two-level cafe were packed saturday .
many will come back again and again , and out-of-towners , like pioretski , will eagerly await the opening of franchises in their home town .

but the situation of the farmers providing them beans for their latte macchiatos remains miserable . it certainly took awhile .
starbucks opened 5,400 stores in north america , asia and the rest of europe before arriving in germany .
one has to wonder why .
germany is the second-largest importer of coffee behind the united states , according to the international coffee organization -lrb- ico -rrb- .
the consumption here is high and gradually rising , with some 74 billion cups drunk in 2001 – almost 1,000 cups per german per year .
" the chances for going into the market are very good right now , " hans georg müller , of the german coffee association told dw-world .
coffee bars and shops are booming in germany at the moment as part of a european-wide trend in coffee bars led initially by england .
" someone asked me a couple of years ago , ' isn ’ t there a stage of market saturation ?

" but it doesn ’ t seem to have happened .
it just keeps on going on . "
there are currently 400 starbucks-style coffee bars in germany , but room for at least 1,000 , müller said .
current chains include cafetiero , caras and frazer coffee in frankfurt .
but their presence is relatively small and something starbucks can easily surpass with its plans to open up at least 180 other franchises in germany in the coming years .
" i think it ’ s good for the whole coffee shop market , " said müller , pointing to the chain ’ s recognition factor .

there is a current surplus of 10 million bags of coffee on the market .
more coffee bars aren ’ t likely to reduce that count , because the typical coffee bar latte or macchiato has a low concentration of beans .
" it ’ s just a shot of espresso and a lot of milk , " said wattam .
coffee retailers can stay afloat because they roast the coffee and turn a cheap commodity into something valuable .
as a result , they have the freedom to mark up the prices when they begin selling the roasted beans .
coffee farmers see none of that money , said wattam in an interview with dw-world .
less financial incentive means less of an effort to produce quality beans which explains why at least five percent of the coffee currently on the international market is of poor quality .
reversing the downturn wattam ’ s organization hopes to reverse that trend by simply eliminating that five percent from the market .
to help the farmers survive , the organization is encouraging diversification in farming and introducing ad campaigns in countries such as india to increase domestic demand for a domestic product , wattam said .

but the situation of the farmers providing them beans for their latte macchiatos remains miserable . it certainly took awhile .
starbucks opened 5,400 stores in north america , asia and the rest of europe before arriving in germany .
one has to wonder why .
germany is the second-largest importer of coffee behind the united states , according to the international coffee organization -lrb- ico -rrb- .
the consumption here is high and gradually rising , with some 74 billion cups drunk in 2001 – almost 1,000 cups per german per year .
" the chances for going into the market are very good right now , " hans georg müller , of the german coffee association told dw-world .
coffee bars and shops are booming in germany at the moment as part of a european-wide trend in coffee bars led initially by england .
" someone asked me a couple of years ago , ' isn ’ t there a stage of market saturation ?
this can ’ t go on , ' " said martin wattam , of the ico in london .
" but it doesn ’ t seem to have happened .
it just keeps on going on . "
there are currently 400 starbucks-style coffee bars in germany , but room for at least 1,000 , müller said .
current chains include cafetiero , caras and frazer coffee in frankfurt .
but their presence is relatively small and something starbucks can easily surpass with its plans to open up at least 180 other franchises in germany in the coming years .
" i think it ’ s good for the whole coffee shop market , " said müller , pointing to the chain ’ s recognition factor .
" it will give a kind of push to the market . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coffee beans farmers losing out in coffee bar boom farmers in africa , asia and latin america hit hard by the reduced demand for coffee worldwide are likely to disagree .
there is a current surplus of 10 million bags of coffee on the market .
more coffee bars aren ’ t likely to reduce that count , because the typical coffee bar latte or macchiato has a low concentration of beans .
" it ’ s just a shot of espresso and a lot of milk , " said wattam .
coffee retailers can stay afloat because they roast the coffee and turn a cheap commodity into something valuable .
as a result , they have the freedom to mark up the prices when they begin selling the roasted beans .
coffee farmers see none of that money , said wattam in an interview with dw-world .
less financial incentive means less of an effort to produce quality beans which explains why at least five percent of the coffee currently on the international market is of poor quality .
reversing the downturn wattam ’ s organization hopes to reverse that trend by simply eliminating that five percent from the market .
to help the farmers survive , the organization is encouraging diversification in farming and introducing ad campaigns in countries such as india to increase domestic demand for a domestic product , wattam said .
" one can ’ t stress enough the point of having a stable market , " he said .
" it ’ s not like we want farmers driving around in rolls royces , it ’ s a question of prices .

but it 's best not to tinker on the path to global domination . the tall mocha sat unclaimed for what seemed like hours .
the barista -lrb- an overly fancy word for the person who makes coffee and takes your money -rrb- called and called .
but no body came .
the coffee buyers and starbucks rookies stared dumbly at their receipts .
was that a tall macchiato or a grande latte with peppermint syrup that i ordered ?
why isn ’ t anybody picking that up ?
is that mine ?
did that caramel macchiato really cost € 4.30 ?
the baristas weren ’ t on top of things either .
chaos was the rule of the morning behind the counter as the first-ever starbucks opened its doors in the very hip , very upwardly mobile heart of germany 's capital city .
press had been invited to the location on rosenthaler strasse in berlin ’ s mitte district friday night to celebrate the opening with execs from starbucks and their german partner karstadtquelle .
outside , the next day ’ s potential customers gazed through the coffee shop ’ s large street-front windows , getting a peek of the couch and wooden table interior americans , asians and brits have grown accustomed to over the past decade .
after launching more than 5,000 stores in asia and the rest of europe , the world ’ s largest coffee chain finally decided it was time to conquer the " kaffee and kuchen " coffee culture of germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : first starbucks coffee house in germany at the " hackesche höfe " in berlin an american at home abroad there was a fat line when i rolled into starbucks just before midday saturday .
after all , this was one of america ’ s greatest exports in a neighborhood filled with hip berliners who cherished their slices of americana – even if they didn ’ t always admit to it .
starbucks coffee house imitators had already opened shop near rosenthaler strasse and other streets in the mitte district in the past few years .
their counters had a steady stream of young professionals grabbing a latte to go – complete with the cardboard sleeve that guarded against cup burn and potential lawsuits .
now those same experienced professionals were lined up at the starbucks counter , gazing at the myriad of choices a single cup of coffee offered .
brochures explaining each drink were available and the green-aproned , black polo shirted starbucks crew was always helpful with suggestions .
i ordered a caramel macchiato for the first time in my life .
it was the kind of drink my friends and i always made fun of back in san francisco .
macchiato ?
syrup shots ?
just give me a damn cup of coffee .
besides , our loyalty , and we liked to think , the rest of the bay area ’ s , was to starbucks ' competitor peets coffee .
you could paint entire houses and pave sidewalks on the jolt a large mocca from peets gave you , your hands shivering like a junkie ’ s all the way .
when a starbucks opened up down the street from our beloved peets , we booed and hissed .
so artificial , so cold , so , so ... green .
i moved away from all of that when i came to berlin .
sitting down to a civilized cup of coffee was charming and european , and the quality was fantastic .
but the germans still had a lot to learn when it came to coffee on the go .
the small plastic cups burned the hands and the taste left something , well , a lot , to be desired .
now starbucks is here , ostensibly to teach them that .
the little cups with the green mermaid logo will pepper trash cans throughout berlin in the coming year , when as many as five more franchises open up in the capital city .
but the one on rosenthaler strasse will be the test run .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inside view of the first starbucks coffee house in germany to their credit , the starbucks people have done nothing to make the first german chain any more special .
the couches are the same shades of brown and burgundy as in okinawa and fort lauderdale .
the loudspeakers loop out old jazz and light soul jams -lrb- aretha franklin , james brown , nothing too risky , of course -rrb- .
the walls are covered with tinted or black and white photographs of street scapes or architecture – none of which are distinctly german .
seattle style sells hell , starbucks is conquering the rest of the world without looking any different than the inagural store in seattle .
why should germany be any different ?
" i like it because it ’ s the same everywhere , " said alexandra pioretzki , a 24-year-old student from nuremberg who still has fond memories of her first starbucks cappucino on the banks of lake michigan in chicago .
since then , she ’ s visited starbucks coffee bars in switzerland and asia .
" for me , it ’ s a bit of this world feeling , " she said .
" it ’ s home , but in the sense that my home is the world . "
the franchise will have no problem attracting globe-trotting young germans like pioretzki .
it ’ s the older generations , who are used to just getting a damn cup of coffee , that will be harder to pull in .
for now , the rosenthaler shop doesn ’ t need to worry about all that .
the comfy chairs and wooden tables on both levels of the two-level cafe were packed saturday .
many will come back again and again , and out-of-towners , like pioretski , will eagerly await the opening of franchises in their home town .

they also pledged to increase cooperation in the war against terrorism .
" this is a historic and hopeful day for russia and america , " bush said as he started his first visit to moscow .
" president putin and i today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our two countries . "
he added that the agreement " liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility . "
at a ceremony in the kremlin 's gilded andreyevsky hall , the presidents formalized the first nuclear disarmament agreement between their countries since january 1993 .
the ceremony served as the centerpiece of a four-day summit that will also include a visit to putin 's hometown of st. petersburg .
massive cutbacks under the landmark treaty , the two sides plan to reduce their arsenals by around two-thirds .
the treaty is intended to reduce the number of warheads in russia and the u.s. from an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 today to about 1,700 to 2,200 warheads within a decade .
the deal came after the u.s. announced its withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in december .
that treaty precluded the u.s. from deploying a missile defense system it is seeking to build in order to protect itself from weapons of mass destruction .
" pootie-poot " and k street 's finest the treaty marks a new era of cooperation for the two nations .
indeed , both bush and putin offered comedic exchanges during the signing ceremony .

bush , for his part , has nicknamed the leader of america 's cold war nemesis " pootie-poot . "
but the event also had more somber moments keeping in line with the historic magnitude of the occasion .
putin , who knows his cash-strapped country ca n't afford to maintain its cold war arsenal any longer , was more measured : " it is a decision taken by two countries on behalf of international security and strategic stability . "
critics of the treaty point out that under its terms , either side is allowed to store weapons for possible later use .
additionally , the treaty can be called off with three months notice from moscow or washington .

the bush adminstration worries that the nuclear plant could be converted to produce materials used in the construction of nuclear weapons .
" i 'd like to point out that cooperation between iran and russia is not of a character which would undermine the process of non-proliferation , " putin said .
" our cooperation is exclusively as regards to the energy sector focused on the problems of an economic nature . "

they also pledged to increase cooperation in the war against terrorism .
" this is a historic and hopeful day for russia and america , " bush said as he started his first visit to moscow .
" president putin and i today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our two countries . "
he added that the agreement " liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility . "
at a ceremony in the kremlin 's gilded andreyevsky hall , the presidents formalized the first nuclear disarmament agreement between their countries since january 1993 .
the ceremony served as the centerpiece of a four-day summit that will also include a visit to putin 's hometown of st. petersburg .
massive cutbacks under the landmark treaty , the two sides plan to reduce their arsenals by around two-thirds .
the treaty is intended to reduce the number of warheads in russia and the u.s. from an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 today to about 1,700 to 2,200 warheads within a decade .
the deal came after the u.s. announced its withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in december .

bush , for his part , has nicknamed the leader of america 's cold war nemesis " pootie-poot . "
but the event also had more somber moments keeping in line with the historic magnitude of the occasion .
putin , who knows his cash-strapped country ca n't afford to maintain its cold war arsenal any longer , was more measured : " it is a decision taken by two countries on behalf of international security and strategic stability . "
critics of the treaty point out that under its terms , either side is allowed to store weapons for possible later use .
additionally , the treaty can be called off with three months notice from moscow or washington .

the bush adminstration worries that the nuclear plant could be converted to produce materials used in the construction of nuclear weapons .
" i 'd like to point out that cooperation between iran and russia is not of a character which would undermine the process of non-proliferation , " putin said .
" our cooperation is exclusively as regards to the energy sector focused on the problems of an economic nature . "
german government applauds treaty foreign minister joschka fischer greeted friday 's development , describing the agreement as a step in the path to a final disposal of the nuclear arsenal .

" this is a historic and hopeful day for russia and america , " bush said as he started his first visit to moscow .
" president putin and i today ended a long chapter of confrontation and opened up an entirely new relationship between our two countries . "
he added that the agreement " liquidates the cold war legacy of nuclear hostility . "
at a ceremony in the kremlin 's gilded andreyevsky hall , the presidents formalized the first nuclear disarmament agreement between their countries since january 1993 .
the ceremony served as the centerpiece of a four-day summit that will also include a visit to putin 's hometown of st. petersburg .
massive cutbacks under the landmark treaty , the two sides plan to reduce their arsenals by around two-thirds .
the treaty is intended to reduce the number of warheads in russia and the u.s. from an estimated 5,000 to 6,000 today to about 1,700 to 2,200 warheads within a decade .
the deal came after the u.s. announced its withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty in december .
that treaty precluded the u.s. from deploying a missile defense system it is seeking to build in order to protect itself from weapons of mass destruction .
" pootie-poot " and k street 's finest the treaty marks a new era of cooperation for the two nations .
indeed , both bush and putin offered comedic exchanges during the signing ceremony .
the russian president , who is often regarded as stiff , joked that " the best lobbyist of the interests of u.s. companies is the american president standing here . "
bush , for his part , has nicknamed the leader of america 's cold war nemesis " pootie-poot . "
but the event also had more somber moments keeping in line with the historic magnitude of the occasion .
putin , who knows his cash-strapped country ca n't afford to maintain its cold war arsenal any longer , was more measured : " it is a decision taken by two countries on behalf of international security and strategic stability . "
critics of the treaty point out that under its terms , either side is allowed to store weapons for possible later use .
additionally , the treaty can be called off with three months notice from moscow or washington .
tension over iran the russian president also publicly clashed with bush over u.s. criticism of a russian program that is helping iran to build a nuclear power plant .
the bush adminstration worries that the nuclear plant could be converted to produce materials used in the construction of nuclear weapons .
" i 'd like to point out that cooperation between iran and russia is not of a character which would undermine the process of non-proliferation , " putin said .
" our cooperation is exclusively as regards to the energy sector focused on the problems of an economic nature . "
german government applauds treaty foreign minister joschka fischer greeted friday 's development , describing the agreement as a step in the path to a final disposal of the nuclear arsenal .

prime minister tony blair has already defended the decision to take the money .

the £ 100,000 gift from mr desmond , who owns magazines like asian babes and horny housewives as well as express newspapers , angered some labour rank-and-file members .

labour chairman charles clarke said labour has said it will decide whether to accept donations on a case by case basis .

otto schily said that officials are investigating reports in the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper that 30 taleban and al-qaeda members had disappeared in slovakia .
but he said there were no concrete indications of an imminent attack .
mr schily was speaking at the publication of the annual report on extremism by the federal office for the protection of the constitution of germany .
extremist threat the newspaper suggested that the extremists may have been heading for britain to regroup .
the west has been on the alert since the us attacks mr schily confirmed that the authorities had received a report in that direction , and were following it up .
the newspaper report cited a warning letter from interpol to law enforcement officers and border guards .
it suggested that the group had fled a refugee camp in slovakia on 12 march and had not been seen since .
the group was claiming asylum in the country , having been smuggled through bulgaria and hungary , it said .
mr schily described islamic extremism as the greatest threat to german internal security .
but he warned of what he called " alarmism " , saying great efforts were needed to confront the danger without giving way to panic .
new figures show a marginal increase in the membership of what were considered to be foreign extremist organisations - 59,000 members of such groups have been counted .

new recommendations have been drawn up to end the practice of imposing lenient prison terms on men who have raped their wives , girlfriends or women they have met on dates .
the sentencing advisory panel , which assists the court of appeal on drawing up sentence guidelines , is urging a radical overhaul of punishment terms for rape .
sentencing practice does appear to be more lenient when the victim and offender were known to each other professor martin wasik , panel chairman the independent report wants the starting point for all rapes to be five years in prison .
under current law , one in four rapists receive a prison sentence of less than five years .
panel chairman professor martin wasik said : " sentencing practice does appear to be more lenient when the victim and offender were known to each other . "
this was despite the fact that current guidelines , last issued in 1986 , " do not mention the relationship between victim and offender as a factor that should affect the sentence " , he said .
clear statement rape is always seen as a very serious crime , and the impact on the victim is as great , regardless of the individual 's relationship with the rapist , a report commissioned by the panel found .
professor wasik said : " it seemed clear to us from the outset that the relevance , if any , of a relationship between victim and offender was a factor that could not simply be ignored in new sentencing guidelines for rape . "
the report advises new guidelines should include a clear statement that 'relationship rape ' and 'acquaintance rape ' are to be treated by the courts as being no less serious than 'stranger rape ' .
rape support groups are unhappy with the panel 's suggestion that rapists should be punished less severely where a victim , with whom they are " sexually familiar " , says " no " at the last moment .
the report said that in this situation : " the offender 's culpability for rape is somewhat less than it would have been if he had intended to rape the victim from the outset . "
however , it says that given the serious nature of the offence of rape , whatever the circumstances , the sentence adjustment in such a case should , be relatively small ' insulting ' assumptions sandra mcneill , of the rape crisis federation , said : " the idea that the sentence for rape should be lower if you have had some degree of intimacy with the man is shoring up the myth that men ca n't control themselves .
" defence barristers have defined sexual familiarity as a kiss or a dance .
" this recommendation seems to be saying that all women should assume all men are beasts and behave accordingly - that is , never kiss them .
" such thinking is as much of an insult to men as it is to women . "
however , she said it did not undermine their backing of the panel 's main recommendation on dealing with acquaintance rape in the same way as stranger rape .
" rape by men we know should be treated as seriously as stranger rape , " she said .
the report recommends an eight-year minimum jail term for particularly horrific rapes , for example the rape of a child or involving drugs to overcome a victim or where the rape results in a pregnancy .
other rapes which would attract the eight-year minimum , would include group rapes .

swept along by the media scrum , which squeezed its way through the ghana market 's dark and narrow alleyways , the little girl made sure she stayed just inches away from the two men at its centre .
her patience was eventually rewarded .
as the shutters snapped and the tapes rolled , a rock star and one of the world 's most powerful men squabbled over who would buy her a necklace .
it was one of many photo opportunities in the market which , even at seven in the morning , was beginning to absorb the humidity of a may day in accra .
the u2 frontman bono looked slightly more comfortable in the heat as he chatted with stallholders , stopping to buy a bag of peppers , while the us treasury secretary paul o 'neill blended in as best he could , decked out in a freshly pressed oxford shirt , spotless leisure slacks and immaculate loafers .
despite their obvious differences -lrb- one made his money out of aluminium , the other out of rock -rrb- the two were soon absorbed trying to convince the other of how best to help africa 's poorest nations .
for bono , it is a mix of debt cancellation , short-term aid and helping african exporters achieve a fairer price for their products .
bono 's desire mr o 'neill , on the other hand , is a free wheeling free trader , who thinks africa should throw open its markets to foreign investors .
bono regards the poorer countries as unfortunate losers in a global game of risk , mr o 'neill sees them more as businesses in need of serious tinkering at boardroom level .
the gulf between them is reflected in the media surrounding them , with a crowd of be-tied washington-based economic journalists in one coach , and a rabble of jeans-clad entertainment reporters in the other .
bono manages to keep both engaged .
on the first day of the tour , we returned to the la palm hotel after a busy schedule which involved trade fairs , a visit to the sumptuous castle which houses ghana 's president john kufuor .
not forgetting round table discussions with community leaders and a tribal king who entered the room preceeded by a page carrying a large pink umbrella and another blowing on a conch shell , before challenging everyone 's preconceptions by speaking in an american accent .
with or without you as soon as bono walked into the lobby , the exhausted singer was surrounded by the financial journalists , exploring the strength of his grip on macroeconomics .
he parried their questions successfully until he started to weaken .
leaning over to me -lrb- spotting that i fell in to the light entertainment category -rrb- he asked , under his breath , to be dragged to the bar , under the guise of a pre-arranged interview .
i complied .
two large gin and tonics later , and we were talking about his early days in london on the chiswick road while he puffed on the cigarette he had begged off an astonished couple sitting nearby .
the force of bono 's personality certainly gets him noticed , but the force of his argument means he is also taken seriously .
though many , including paul o 'neill , quibble with major parts of his solution , which he describes as a " partnership " between the richer countries in the north and the poorer ones in the south , his involvement has ensured this trip to ghana , south africa , uganda and ethiopia is getting so much attention .
beautiful day certainly the travelling press corps will find it hard to forget .
especially those of us who drank bottles of beer and ate army rations while trapped for 8 hours in the northern town of tamale , waiting for the storm clouds to clear for our return flight to accra .
bono entertained us with magic tricks which became increasingly less convincing as the crates of beer emptied .
the sight of bono staggering across the tarmac with his entourage while paul o 'neill strode purposefully - and soberly - up the steps to the presidential jet accentuated the difference between the two men , but was also strangely reassuring .
the rock star had n't given up his day job .
