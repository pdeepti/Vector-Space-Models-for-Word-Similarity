critics in germany say it will result in massive job losses . health ministers from 13 of the 15 european union countries voted to ban cigarette ads in member states on monday . the directive , which will come into effect by july 31 , 2005 , at the latest , forbids tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines , radio broadcasts and on the internet .
only germany and britain opposed the legislation . germany 's social democrat- and greens-led government criticized the decision , insisting the directive oversteps the eu 's jurisdiction .
it is questionable " whether the eu has a mandate to intervene in national advertising markets , " said alexander müller , a spokesman for the ministry of agriculture and consumer protection .
still , the government " supports all eu and international efforts to reduce the negative health effects of smoking , " she said . " echoing the tobacco industry " germany has a record of resisting limits to the tobacco industry .
two years ago , it successfully blocked application of similar restrictions at the european court of justice in luxembourg . in october , germany was awarded the marlboro man award from the anti-tobacco organization natt for " echoing tobacco industry arguments " at un framework convention on tobacco control talks in geneva . germany now has 50 days to appeal to the european court of justice to stop the directive .
diplomats are assessing whether to undertake legal action . but this time the eu 's health commissioner is n't worried about the prospect of german legal action .
thorsten münch , a spokesman for the commissioner , said the directive is " legally water-tight . " close to 18 million germans are considered " smokers . "

the german state rakes in more than half of that , with € 14 million -lrb- $ 13.96 million -rrb- in taxes on cigarette sales yearly . criticism from germany critics of the legislation focus on two issues : the loss of revenues that will ensue from banning advertising and the fear that this is only the beginning of a possible wave of advertising bans that could be applied to alcohol or children 's toys , for instance . the already ailing german newspaper industry , too , will have to forsake millions of euros in advertising .
tobacco advertising accounted for around € 40 million -lrb- $ 39.87 million -rrb- last year . volker nickel , head of the german advertising federation -lrb- zaw -rrb- , says the ban could threaten up to 10,000 jobs .
" cigarettes are legal products and you must be able to advertise for legal products , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the german union of newspaper publishers even went so far as to declare the ban a move against press freedom . " scandalous behavior " meanwhile , the german medical association -lrb- bäk -rrb- welcomed the directive and criticized the government 's position .
" the government 's behavior is scandalous , " said the bäk president jörg-dietrich hoppe .
" it is irresponsible to place the interests of individual business branches above the health of the population .

it is questionable " whether the eu has a mandate to intervene in national advertising markets , " said alexander müller , a spokesman for the ministry of agriculture and consumer protection .
still , the government " supports all eu and international efforts to reduce the negative health effects of smoking , " she said . " echoing the tobacco industry " germany has a record of resisting limits to the tobacco industry .
two years ago , it successfully blocked application of similar restrictions at the european court of justice in luxembourg . in october , germany was awarded the marlboro man award from the anti-tobacco organization natt for " echoing tobacco industry arguments " at un framework convention on tobacco control talks in geneva . germany now has 50 days to appeal to the european court of justice to stop the directive .
diplomats are assessing whether to undertake legal action . but this time the eu 's health commissioner is n't worried about the prospect of german legal action .
thorsten münch , a spokesman for the commissioner , said the directive is " legally water-tight . " close to 18 million germans are considered " smokers . "

the german state rakes in more than half of that , with € 14 million -lrb- $ 13.96 million -rrb- in taxes on cigarette sales yearly . criticism from germany critics of the legislation focus on two issues : the loss of revenues that will ensue from banning advertising and the fear that this is only the beginning of a possible wave of advertising bans that could be applied to alcohol or children 's toys , for instance . the already ailing german newspaper industry , too , will have to forsake millions of euros in advertising .
tobacco advertising accounted for around € 40 million -lrb- $ 39.87 million -rrb- last year . volker nickel , head of the german advertising federation -lrb- zaw -rrb- , says the ban could threaten up to 10,000 jobs .
" cigarettes are legal products and you must be able to advertise for legal products , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
the german union of newspaper publishers even went so far as to declare the ban a move against press freedom . " scandalous behavior " meanwhile , the german medical association -lrb- bäk -rrb- welcomed the directive and criticized the government 's position .
" the government 's behavior is scandalous , " said the bäk president jörg-dietrich hoppe .

critics in germany say it will result in massive job losses . health ministers from 13 of the 15 european union countries voted to ban cigarette ads in member states on monday . the directive , which will come into effect by july 31 , 2005 , at the latest , forbids tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines , radio broadcasts and on the internet .
only germany and britain opposed the legislation . germany 's social democrat- and greens-led government criticized the decision , insisting the directive oversteps the eu 's jurisdiction .
it is questionable " whether the eu has a mandate to intervene in national advertising markets , " said alexander müller , a spokesman for the ministry of agriculture and consumer protection .
still , the government " supports all eu and international efforts to reduce the negative health effects of smoking , " she said . " echoing the tobacco industry " germany has a record of resisting limits to the tobacco industry .
two years ago , it successfully blocked application of similar restrictions at the european court of justice in luxembourg . in october , germany was awarded the marlboro man award from the anti-tobacco organization natt for " echoing tobacco industry arguments " at un framework convention on tobacco control talks in geneva . germany now has 50 days to appeal to the european court of justice to stop the directive .
diplomats are assessing whether to undertake legal action . but this time the eu 's health commissioner is n't worried about the prospect of german legal action .
thorsten münch , a spokesman for the commissioner , said the directive is " legally water-tight . " close to 18 million germans are considered " smokers . "

the german state rakes in more than half of that , with € 14 million -lrb- $ 13.96 million -rrb- in taxes on cigarette sales yearly . criticism from germany critics of the legislation focus on two issues : the loss of revenues that will ensue from banning advertising and the fear that this is only the beginning of a possible wave of advertising bans that could be applied to alcohol or children 's toys , for instance . the already ailing german newspaper industry , too , will have to forsake millions of euros in advertising .
tobacco advertising accounted for around € 40 million -lrb- $ 39.87 million -rrb- last year . volker nickel , head of the german advertising federation -lrb- zaw -rrb- , says the ban could threaten up to 10,000 jobs .

the german union of newspaper publishers even went so far as to declare the ban a move against press freedom . " scandalous behavior " meanwhile , the german medical association -lrb- bäk -rrb- welcomed the directive and criticized the government 's position .
" the government 's behavior is scandalous , " said the bäk president jörg-dietrich hoppe .

only germany and britain opposed the legislation . germany 's social democrat- and greens-led government criticized the decision , insisting the directive oversteps the eu 's jurisdiction .
it is questionable " whether the eu has a mandate to intervene in national advertising markets , " said alexander müller , a spokesman for the ministry of agriculture and consumer protection .

critics in germany say it will result in massive job losses . health ministers from 13 of the 15 european union countries voted to ban cigarette ads in member states on monday . the directive , which will come into effect by july 31 , 2005 , at the latest , forbids tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines , radio broadcasts and on the internet .
only germany and britain opposed the legislation . germany 's social democrat- and greens-led government criticized the decision , insisting the directive oversteps the eu 's jurisdiction .
it is questionable " whether the eu has a mandate to intervene in national advertising markets , " said alexander müller , a spokesman for the ministry of agriculture and consumer protection .
still , the government " supports all eu and international efforts to reduce the negative health effects of smoking , " she said . " echoing the tobacco industry " germany has a record of resisting limits to the tobacco industry .
two years ago , it successfully blocked application of similar restrictions at the european court of justice in luxembourg . in october , germany was awarded the marlboro man award from the anti-tobacco organization natt for " echoing tobacco industry arguments " at un framework convention on tobacco control talks in geneva . germany now has 50 days to appeal to the european court of justice to stop the directive .
diplomats are assessing whether to undertake legal action . but this time the eu 's health commissioner is n't worried about the prospect of german legal action .

only germany and britain opposed the legislation . germany 's social democrat- and greens-led government criticized the decision , insisting the directive oversteps the eu 's jurisdiction .
it is questionable " whether the eu has a mandate to intervene in national advertising markets , " said alexander müller , a spokesman for the ministry of agriculture and consumer protection .
still , the government " supports all eu and international efforts to reduce the negative health effects of smoking , " she said . " echoing the tobacco industry " germany has a record of resisting limits to the tobacco industry .

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- us insists iraq is hiding weapons news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : middle east news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help languages editions change to uk friday , 6 december , 2002 , 05:34 gmt us insists iraq is hiding weapons the us is keen to keep up the pressure the bush administration says it has solid evidence that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction even as iraq issues firm denials .
the united states is turning up the pressure on iraq before the sunday deadline by which baghdad must reveal all its weapons programmes to the united nations to comply with a resolution .
the bbc 's justin webb in washington says us officials are not revealing what information they have , in order to force iraq to guess what it might be .
saddam urged his people to give the inspectors a chance to clear iraq 's name then if iraq - which maintains it has no banned weapons - tells the un something which can be shown to be false , the us could direct weapons inspectors towards a target and possibly hasten action against saddam 's regime , our correspondent says .
the us has called for inspections ordered under the un resolution to be stepped up .
defence secretary donald rumsfeld said it was vital that the un ensured that the terms of the resolution passed unanimously by the security council last month were being met .
he said iraq had weapons of mass destruction and could either declare them or try to continue to cover them up .
iraqi ' lies ' white house spokesman ari fleischer refused to give details on what evidence the us had , but said intelligence would be passed on to the inspectors in iraq .
" the president of the united states and the secretary of defence would not assert as plainly and bluntly as they have that iraq has weapons of mass destruction if it was not true , and if they did not have a solid basis for saying it , " he said .
on wednesday , iraqi deputy prime minister tariq aziz told a us television network that iraq had no chemical , biological or nuclear weaponry , though some innocent equipment could be deemed as " dual use " with a possible military capability .
a false declaration would make clear to the world that saddam 's strategy is deceit - we will not allow him to get away with it uk foreign secretary jack straw mr fleischer responded : " that statement is just as false as statements that iraq made in the late 90s when they said they had no weapons of mass destruction , when it was found they indeed did .
there is no basis to that . "
president bush himself refused to be drawn directly on what could trigger a war , saying that was a question for saddam hussein .
but in london , british foreign secretary jack straw reminded iraq that it risked an attack if it provided an inaccurate account of its weapons programmes .
" while this weekend will not be the moment to declare iraq either in breach or in compliance , a false declaration would make clear to the world that saddam 's strategy is deceit , " mr straw said .
" we will not allow him to get away with it . "
dossier promise a senior iraqi official in baghdad has said iraq will present its dossier on saturday - before the deadline set in the un resolution which was written jointly by britain and the us .
the weapons inspectors who returned to iraq after a four-year absence will not make any searches on thursday or friday in respect for the eid al-fitr festival at the end of the holy month of ramadan .

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- us insists iraq is hiding weapons bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point friday , 6 december , 2002 , 05:34 gmt us insists iraq is hiding weapons the bush administration says it has solid evidence that saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction even as iraq issues firm denials .
the united states is turning up the pressure on iraq before the sunday deadline by which baghdad must reveal all its weapons programmes to the united nations to comply with a resolution .
the bbc 's justin webb in washington says us officials are not revealing what information they have , in order to force iraq to guess what it might be .
then if iraq - which maintains it has no banned weapons - tells the un something which can be shown to be false , the us could direct weapons inspectors towards a target and possibly hasten action against saddam 's regime , our correspondent says .
the us has called for inspections ordered under the un resolution to be stepped up .
defence secretary donald rumsfeld said it was vital that the un ensured that the terms of the resolution passed unanimously by the security council last month were being met .
he said iraq had weapons of mass destruction and could either declare them or try to continue to cover them up .
iraqi ' lies ' white house spokesman ari fleischer refused to give details on what evidence the us had , but said intelligence would be passed on to the inspectors in iraq .
" the president of the united states and the secretary of defence would not assert as plainly and bluntly as they have that iraq has weapons of mass destruction if it was not true , and if they did not have a solid basis for saying it , " he said .
on wednesday , iraqi deputy prime minister tariq aziz told a us television network that iraq had no chemical , biological or nuclear weaponry , though some innocent equipment could be deemed as " dual use " with a possible military capability . "
a false declaration would make clear to the world that saddam 's strategy is deceit - we will not allow him to get away with it " uk foreign secretary jack straw mr fleischer responded : " that statement is just as false as statements that iraq made in the late 90s when they said they had no weapons of mass destruction , when it was found they indeed did .
there is no basis to that . "
president bush himself refused to be drawn directly on what could trigger a war , saying that was a question for saddam hussein .
but in london , british foreign secretary jack straw reminded iraq that it risked an attack if it provided an inaccurate account of its weapons programmes .
" while this weekend will not be the moment to declare iraq either in breach or in compliance , a false declaration would make clear to the world that saddam 's strategy is deceit , " mr straw said .
" we will not allow him to get away with it . "
dossier promise a senior iraqi official in baghdad has said iraq will present its dossier on saturday - before the deadline set in the un resolution which was written jointly by britain and the us .
the weapons inspectors who returned to iraq after a four-year absence will not make any searches on thursday or friday in respect for the eid al-fitr festival at the end of the holy month of ramadan .
iraqi president saddam hussein urged his people to give the inspectors a chance and be patient in the face of what he called " unjust , arrogant , debased american tyranny " .
in a televised speech , he said iraq had accepted the inspectors " to keep our people out of harm 's way " and in the hope that american allegations could be disproved .
his vice-president , taha yassin ramadan , has accused inspectors of being spies , but that has been rejected by the weapons teams .

colt emphatically denies highberry 's allegations , and believes that the petition is without merit colt statement one of the firm 's bondholders , us-backed hedge fund highberry , is asking the high court to have the company wound down on the grounds that it will be unable to repay its debt .
highberry , part of new york-based hedge fund elliott associates , believes colt is set to miss repayments on bonds worth £ 1.1bn -lrb- $ 1.6bn -rrb- which fall due between 2005 and 2009 .
the fund says colt 's forecasts have been overly optimistic , and questions whether the telecoms market can recover .
aggressive action but colt has rejected highberry 's claim as ' baseless ' , pointing out that it is free of bank debt and is sitting on a £ 1bn cash pile .
" colt emphatically denies highberry 's allegations , and believes that the petition is without merit , " the company said in a statement .
it said its latest audited accounts , drawn up in late september , showed that it was " strongly solvent . "
the court case , expected to last three days , will begin on friday with a statement from highberry 's director .
highberry 's move is seen as an aggressive attempt to protect its investment in colt telecom .
the fund holds about £ 75m of colt bonds .
hit by the downturn analysts say highberry 's move has little chance of success since the bonds do not fall due for another three years .
a further factor in colt 's favour is that it has never missed a debt repayment to date , and has not warned that it is likely to do so .
however , two years ago highberry managed to win a $ 58m payout from the peruvian government in a legal dispute over bond repayments .
colt , which specialises in providing telecoms services to businesses , has been hit hard by the downturn in telecoms markets .
the company was forced to lay off 800 staff earlier this year .
colt shares were flat at 44.75p in early trade , down from peak of over £ 40 in february 2000 .

plans to build scotland 's second children 's hospice at loch lomond have run into trouble .
the newly-created national park authority is being recommended to refuse the application by chas , the children 's hospice association scotland .
the authority says the scheme does not comply with new rules on land use .
the film star , ewan mcgregor , who supports chas , has expressed his anger at the move .
what 's the best use of national park land ?
should there be exemptions for projects like a children 's hospice or are such plans simply being hindered by red tape ?
here are some of your views chas has had plans for this development for years .
maybe it is time to take notice of what the people want for a change .
carolyn , chicago , usa there is a great need for more children 's hospices throughout the uk .
come on , show you have a heart and conscience !
do the right thing and cut the red tape .
we know it can be done .
let 's give those that need facilities like rachel house more not less choice .
catherine , england chas have looked at over 40 sites before deciding the balloch option was the best .
the land has been gifted to them and it seems the ideal location , national park or not .
of course there would be other equally good sites outwith the park , but would the scottish executive serve a compulsory purchase notice on other sites and grant the site to chas free of charge ?
the balloch site is on the boundary of the park .
the best solution seems to be to move the boundary a few metres - then everyone is happy .
grant scholes , scotland these technocrats were giggling children once but obviously take their happy childhood memories for granted .
to those who will never reach that age of nostalgic recollection they owe the chance to die in a beautiful and peaceful place .
they will come round to this way of thinking or shall forever be haunted by the faces of those that they did n't help .
r.c. robjohn , uk we must meet our commitment to these children and their families .
this hospice must be built on this lovely site .
ann green , scotland what better place for a hospice than at the edge of such beautiful and peaceful scenery ?
i 'm all for it .
stewart goudie , uk it 's a shame that children in such dire need of love and care could be denied the usage of this parkland .
it 's a beautiful area and would do much to raise their spirits , and aid them in their final days .
they do n't have long upon this earth , it 's a shame that there are those that would deny them the smallest bit of happiness that could be derived from such lovely surroundings .
rhianna , usa and uk criticism of the officials involved is ill-founded and unfair martin scotland the new hospice should be built as agreed .
if planning permission is refused , the names of the people responsible should be published .
time for a protest march ?
sandra walker , scotland i think that the councillors should approve the building of the hospice as a valuable addition to loch lomond .
paul , scotland the children who we are talking about need quality of life .
to deny them this is downright cruel .
as a person who has battled against disability discrimination for a very long time i can see yet another disgusting display of " not on our doorstep please " .
this would benefit many children .
the placement would be brilliant for children and i do feel that unless the authority can come up with a very viable and convincing argument it will be very damning upon them .
mel , london criticism of the officials involved is ill-founded and unfair .
it is their legal duty to give advice to the park board based upon the official guidance laid down .
they have no discretion to do otherwise .
the board does have discretion and can make a decision which does not follow the advice given - and they can make it clear in doing so that the decision is an exception and not a precedent .
second , as a past member of the secretary of state working party for loch lomond and the trossachs , which i hope played its part in establishing the national park , i would urge the park board to do exactly that .
the national park is a special place to be enjoyed by the whole nation .
martin , scotland loch lomond should be there for all to enjoy regardless of one 's health or disability .
i would urge the local council / commission to go ahead with the construction plans .
linda cleaver , uk these children and their families deserve all the care and love that can be given in the very best locations .
mrs m cameron , scotland i can not think of a better location for children and their families to use at a time when peace and quiet are needed .
come on scotland , let 's hear your voice .
mrs anderson , scotland the new national park is a perfect location for this hospice .
i would rather see 10 hospices in this area than one shopping centre .
it is obvious that the planners do n't see the hospice as a good money making venture .
we need to get our priorities right .
billy , scotland it sounds to me that this hospice project was being planned before the national park 's boundaries were established .
if that is so then what else can be ' cancelled ' , ' un-approved ' or ' de-listed ' retroactively ?
as for the needs of the children and their families .
studies show that anyone in ill health does better when they can see grass , trees , and nature .
let these special children enjoy peace and love , so that their families can remember their last days as being the best we as a society could provide .
liz powell , canada a national park is the perfect place for a hospice .
after all , it is there to show the wonders of nature to all and the sick are more needy that all others .
robert sinclair shand , scotland hospice is a beautiful program .
it makes life easier not only for the patient , but their families as well .
the final days before death is a time of deep reflection and i can not think of a more serene and peaceful location as loch lomond .
i believe that surroundings are equally important as the care of the program .
i wonder if cameron house and the duck bay marina had as much red tape to cut through ?
i doubt it .
hugh adair , usa i have to write to you to express how annoyed i am at the possibility of the new hospice not being constructed .
i have spent time in rachel house with my good friend of 15 years who suffers from muscular dystrophy .
i have seen first hand the incredible work and dedication of the staff .
i can not comprehend how any person could refuse planning permission for a new hospice .
i am ashamed of the so-called ' powers that be ' in the planning application for a new hospice for the west of scotland christine hughes , scotland the people who are refusing this permission should take a long hard look at themselves and see what their real motive behind their refusal is .
i am at this point trying to refrain from using strong language but these simple people have infuriated me .
i will be supporting the hospice in their bid and i urge all those who read this to do the same .
peter healy , scotland i am ashamed of the so-called ' powers that be ' in the planning application for a new hospice for the west of scotland .
i am one of the many people who have used the hospice over the past year .
i have a grandchild who has a life threatening illness .
rachel house has allowed us to heal as a family , the pain that such terrible prognosis of a child you love can do , in the only place that it is possible to do so .
all staff and friends of this wonderful place are working in a job that our national park administers can only try to imagine .
the likes of them should be forced as part of their job to work for free with the team of rachel house .
only then will they see the courage and equanimity present in this lovely part of the country .
each child is different and so is their illness .
many live for many years with their illness and places like this hospice allow them to have a holiday as a family that normally would not be possible because of medical barriers with insurance and travel .
i pray that the people who make this decision examine their conscience before god and man and remember to put humanity into the result .
christine hughes , scotland it seems that the children who would be cared for in the hospice will have precious little time to appreciate the beauty most of us have our whole lives to enjoy .
it would therefore be both logical and compassionate to build the hospice in such a charming location .
k , uk it truly beggars belief that anyone would advise against building a children 's hospice on the grounds that it would ruin the countryside .
i feel so angry because of narrow minded unfeeling people who have also had the wool pulled over their eyes by a report which does not truly represent the ideas and plans put forward by chas .
from what i 've heard , the only way you will be able to see the building once it 's up is by helicopter .
how can this spoil the area ?
there is of course a lot more to this and thankfully chas has tuesday to try and get people to see sense .
i just think a country park is the most suitable site for this building and i just wish i could say , " in my back garden please " .
ann anderson , scotland .
what is loch lomond national park ?
it certainly does not conform to the perceived notion of an untouched , large expanse of natural wilderness .
it is a place where people work the land and live .
if the planning authority sees fit to build a rather awkward looking visitor / shopping centre on the edge of the loch , then they 're refusal to grant permission to a hospice is a poor show of compassion .
for those who have n't been to scotland 's first national park - it is more in the mind than on the map .
balloch is a bustling small town .
the idea that a children 's hospice might in some way upset the natural wonders is to be perfectly honest a farce -lrb- speaking as one who works in nature conservation -rrb- .
stephanie , glasgow , scotland as someone who frequently travels the scottish countryside , i realise how beautiful it is .
i fail to see what the problem is with giving these children a beautiful and peaceful environment .
the majority of the beautiful countryside i visit has fencing around it because of snobs who want all the land .
at least the children deserve the small space they need .
there should be no argument .
and those people against it should learn to stop being so selfish .
lynne , scotland let these children , and my brother , end their lives peacefully tina mcginlay scotland my brother is a boy who goes to rachel house , he suffers from muscular dystrophy and his life span has been shortened by it .
with another hospice there would be room for more people and more time to spend there .
i have met lots of people who go there , some who have died but everyone loved it there , it made their precious time here special .
the people who are refusing the permission should spend some time there .
i go there often with my brother and have witnessed the wonderful things that the staff do .
help to make even more children 's time here special by letting them have such a beautiful scenery for them and their families to enjoy .
most of us have all our lives to look forward to and wo n't die for a long time .
these children have n't , so why not let them enjoy what time they have left here .
let these children , and my brother , end their lives peacefully !
tina mcginley , scotland why does the hospice have to built at that specific location ?
moving it a few miles away from the proposed location wo n't make any difference to the standard of care which children receive .
let 's face it , what goes on inside the hospice is more important than the surroundings .
it 's important not to allow emotion to cloud our logic .
nobody is saying that the hospice ca n't be built .
it 's simply a question of the location .
james ingram , uk whilst i fully concur that the trossachs national park is without doubt a " national treasure " , it is equally valid to say that chas is another " national treasure " .
having been privileged enough to have first hand knowledge of both the national park and the invaluable contribution that chas makes to scottish society , i fully believe that the two should be linked by the building of scotland 's second hospice at the balloch site .
surely there can be no better place for the children and their families to benefit from respite care than in the idyllic surroundings of the national park .
this project is supported by the local populace , the councillors and our politicians ; it is time for the rest of the scottish people to offer their full support too .

ian cowie , scotland of course it should still be built , more so now than ever .
what a beautiful place it would be for these children to spend their last days on this earth ! !
joanne , the netherlands -lrb- ex scotland -rrb- it is a disgrace that the plans are to be changed at this late stage .
this is more important than the edge of a large national park .
indeed it could be a good point in that it would show that scotland cares about more than just parkland which would be used by the residents of the hospice derek brant , scotland a children 's hospice is a " good thing " but then so are houses for people to live in .
we do n't -lrb- or should n't -rrb- build the latter in green belt / conservation are / areas of outstanding natural beauty or scientific interest .
same applies to the former .
otherwise the " rules " -lrb- such as they are -rrb- get bent depending on who is making the application .
phil , uk rachel house does so much good and chas should have the opportunity to expand its services mary , scotland what is so wrong about having a hospice in beautiful surroundings like the loch lomond area ?
rachel house does so much good and chas should have the opportunity to expand its services .
yes , planning decisions must be made in line with existing legislation , but decisions should also be made on the benefit a project is likely to have .
if the response from consultees has been positive , why hold it to ransom like this ?
mary , scotland there should of course be proper consideration given to such matters , but they should be decided on a case-by-case basis .
this particular application is absolutely worthy of agreement .
the bulk of the groups and the individuals who commented on the application either actively support it or made it clear that they do not object to it .
this is a classic case of public nerves from a bureaucrat who is after all only the acting -lrb- and soon to be replaced -rrb- planning adviser in a new authority that may want to be seen either , at worst , to flex its muscles or , at best , to avoid controversy .
the good thing is they have until 10 december to get themselves sorted out and to reject the advice they are being given , for advice is all it is .
denis mooney , scotland i totally agree that there should be no building on the park !
not ever !
this amounts to emotive blackmail !
there is loads of land surrounding the area that could be used for this most important project .
using these children in this manner is a disgrace !
eileen , uk of course it should be allowed .
i would have thought that anyone with an ounce of compassion would want sick children to be able to spend the time they have left in as comfortable and beautiful environment as possible ?

plans to build scotland 's second children 's hospice at loch lomond have run into trouble .
the newly-created national park authority is being recommended to refuse the application by chas , the children 's hospice association scotland .
the authority says the scheme does not comply with new rules on land use .
the film star , ewan mcgregor , who supports chas , has expressed his anger at the move .
what 's the best use of national park land ?
should there be exemptions for projects like a children 's hospice or are such plans simply being hindered by red tape ?
here are some of your views chas has had plans for this development for years .
maybe it is time to take notice of what the people want for a change .
carolyn , chicago , usa there is a great need for more children 's hospices throughout the uk .
come on , show you have a heart and conscience !
do the right thing and cut the red tape .
we know it can be done .
let 's give those that need facilities like rachel house more not less choice .
catherine , england chas have looked at over 40 sites before deciding the balloch option was the best .
the land has been gifted to them and it seems the ideal location , national park or not .
of course there would be other equally good sites outwith the park , but would the scottish executive serve a compulsory purchase notice on other sites and grant the site to chas free of charge ?
the balloch site is on the boundary of the park .
the best solution seems to be to move the boundary a few metres - then everyone is happy .
grant scholes , scotland these technocrats were giggling children once but obviously take their happy childhood memories for granted .
to those who will never reach that age of nostalgic recollection they owe the chance to die in a beautiful and peaceful place .
they will come round to this way of thinking or shall forever be haunted by the faces of those that they did n't help .
r.c. robjohn , uk we must meet our commitment to these children and their families .
this hospice must be built on this lovely site .
ann green , scotland what better place for a hospice than at the edge of such beautiful and peaceful scenery ?
i 'm all for it .
stewart goudie , uk it 's a shame that children in such dire need of love and care could be denied the usage of this parkland .
it 's a beautiful area and would do much to raise their spirits , and aid them in their final days .
they do n't have long upon this earth , it 's a shame that there are those that would deny them the smallest bit of happiness that could be derived from such lovely surroundings .
rhianna , usa and uk " criticism of the officials involved is ill-founded and unfair " martin scotland the new hospice should be built as agreed .
if planning permission is refused , the names of the people responsible should be published .
time for a protest march ?
sandra walker , scotland i think that the councillors should approve the building of the hospice as a valuable addition to loch lomond .
paul , scotland the children who we are talking about need quality of life .
to deny them this is downright cruel .
as a person who has battled against disability discrimination for a very long time i can see yet another disgusting display of " not on our doorstep please " .
this would benefit many children .
the placement would be brilliant for children and i do feel that unless the authority can come up with a very viable and convincing argument it will be very damning upon them .
mel , london criticism of the officials involved is ill-founded and unfair .
it is their legal duty to give advice to the park board based upon the official guidance laid down .
they have no discretion to do otherwise .
the board does have discretion and can make a decision which does not follow the advice given - and they can make it clear in doing so that the decision is an exception and not a precedent .
second , as a past member of the secretary of state working party for loch lomond and the trossachs , which i hope played its part in establishing the national park , i would urge the park board to do exactly that .
the national park is a special place to be enjoyed by the whole nation .
martin , scotland loch lomond should be there for all to enjoy regardless of one 's health or disability .
i would urge the local council / commission to go ahead with the construction plans .
linda cleaver , uk these children and their families deserve all the care and love that can be given in the very best locations .
mrs m cameron , scotland i can not think of a better location for children and their families to use at a time when peace and quiet are needed .
come on scotland , let 's hear your voice .
mrs anderson , scotland the new national park is a perfect location for this hospice .
i would rather see 10 hospices in this area than one shopping centre .
it is obvious that the planners do n't see the hospice as a good money making venture .
we need to get our priorities right .
billy , scotland it sounds to me that this hospice project was being planned before the national park 's boundaries were established .
if that is so then what else can be ' cancelled ' , ' un-approved ' or ' de-listed ' retroactively ?
as for the needs of the children and their families .
studies show that anyone in ill health does better when they can see grass , trees , and nature .
let these special children enjoy peace and love , so that their families can remember their last days as being the best we as a society could provide .
liz powell , canada a national park is the perfect place for a hospice .
after all , it is there to show the wonders of nature to all and the sick are more needy that all others .
robert sinclair shand , scotland hospice is a beautiful program .
it makes life easier not only for the patient , but their families as well .
the final days before death is a time of deep reflection and i can not think of a more serene and peaceful location as loch lomond .
i believe that surroundings are equally important as the care of the program .
i wonder if cameron house and the duck bay marina had as much red tape to cut through ?
i doubt it .
hugh adair , usa i have to write to you to express how annoyed i am at the possibility of the new hospice not being constructed .
i have spent time in rachel house with my good friend of 15 years who suffers from muscular dystrophy .
i have seen first hand the incredible work and dedication of the staff .
i can not comprehend how any person could refuse planning permission for a new hospice . "
i am ashamed of the so-called ' powers that be ' in the planning application for a new hospice for the west of scotland " christine hughes , scotland the people who are refusing this permission should take a long hard look at themselves and see what their real motive behind their refusal is .
i am at this point trying to refrain from using strong language but these simple people have infuriated me .
i will be supporting the hospice in their bid and i urge all those who read this to do the same .
peter healy , scotland i am ashamed of the so-called ' powers that be ' in the planning application for a new hospice for the west of scotland .
i am one of the many people who have used the hospice over the past year .
i have a grandchild who has a life threatening illness .
rachel house has allowed us to heal as a family , the pain that such terrible prognosis of a child you love can do , in the only place that it is possible to do so .
all staff and friends of this wonderful place are working in a job that our national park administers can only try to imagine .
the likes of them should be forced as part of their job to work for free with the team of rachel house .
only then will they see the courage and equanimity present in this lovely part of the country .
each child is different and so is their illness .
many live for many years with their illness and places like this hospice allow them to have a holiday as a family that normally would not be possible because of medical barriers with insurance and travel .
i pray that the people who make this decision examine their conscience before god and man and remember to put humanity into the result .
christine hughes , scotland it seems that the children who would be cared for in the hospice will have precious little time to appreciate the beauty most of us have our whole lives to enjoy .
it would therefore be both logical and compassionate to build the hospice in such a charming location .
k , uk it truly beggars belief that anyone would advise against building a children 's hospice on the grounds that it would ruin the countryside .
i feel so angry because of narrow minded unfeeling people who have also had the wool pulled over their eyes by a report which does not truly represent the ideas and plans put forward by chas .
from what i 've heard , the only way you will be able to see the building once it 's up is by helicopter .
how can this spoil the area ?
there is of course a lot more to this and thankfully chas has tuesday to try and get people to see sense .
i just think a country park is the most suitable site for this building and i just wish i could say , " in my back garden please " .
ann anderson , scotland .
what is loch lomond national park ?
it certainly does not conform to the perceived notion of an untouched , large expanse of natural wilderness .
it is a place where people work the land and live .
if the planning authority sees fit to build a rather awkward looking visitor / shopping centre on the edge of the loch , then they 're refusal to grant permission to a hospice is a poor show of compassion .
for those who have n't been to scotland 's first national park - it is more in the mind than on the map .
balloch is a bustling small town .
the idea that a children 's hospice might in some way upset the natural wonders is to be perfectly honest a farce -lrb- speaking as one who works in nature conservation -rrb- .
stephanie , glasgow , scotland as someone who frequently travels the scottish countryside , i realise how beautiful it is .
i fail to see what the problem is with giving these children a beautiful and peaceful environment .
the majority of the beautiful countryside i visit has fencing around it because of snobs who want all the land .
at least the children deserve the small space they need .
there should be no argument .
and those people against it should learn to stop being so selfish .
lynne , scotland " let these children , and my brother , end their lives peacefully " tina mcginlay scotland my brother is a boy who goes to rachel house , he suffers from muscular dystrophy and his life span has been shortened by it .
with another hospice there would be room for more people and more time to spend there .
i have met lots of people who go there , some who have died but everyone loved it there , it made their precious time here special .
the people who are refusing the permission should spend some time there .
i go there often with my brother and have witnessed the wonderful things that the staff do .
help to make even more children 's time here special by letting them have such a beautiful scenery for them and their families to enjoy .
most of us have all our lives to look forward to and wo n't die for a long time .
these children have n't , so why not let them enjoy what time they have left here .
let these children , and my brother , end their lives peacefully !
tina mcginley , scotland why does the hospice have to built at that specific location ?
moving it a few miles away from the proposed location wo n't make any difference to the standard of care which children receive .
let 's face it , what goes on inside the hospice is more important than the surroundings .
it 's important not to allow emotion to cloud our logic .
nobody is saying that the hospice ca n't be built .
it 's simply a question of the location .
james ingram , uk whilst i fully concur that the trossachs national park is without doubt a " national treasure " , it is equally valid to say that chas is another " national treasure " .
having been privileged enough to have first hand knowledge of both the national park and the invaluable contribution that chas makes to scottish society , i fully believe that the two should be linked by the building of scotland 's second hospice at the balloch site .
surely there can be no better place for the children and their families to benefit from respite care than in the idyllic surroundings of the national park .
this project is supported by the local populace , the councillors and our politicians ; it is time for the rest of the scottish people to offer their full support too .
you have mine .
ian cowie , scotland of course it should still be built , more so now than ever .
what a beautiful place it would be for these children to spend their last days on this earth ! !
joanne , the netherlands -lrb- ex scotland -rrb- it is a disgrace that the plans are to be changed at this late stage .
