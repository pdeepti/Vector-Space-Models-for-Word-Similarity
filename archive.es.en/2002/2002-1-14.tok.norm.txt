the independent television commission upheld 23 complaints from viewers about a graphic discussion of homosexuality in an episode of the chat show broadcast in november .
it agreed that an interview with the singer boy george exceeded acceptable bounds of taste and decency .
the itc said the interview was almost wholly devoted to the subject of sexuality , including graphic discussion of various sexual practices .
its ruling said : " boy george seemed to be determined to disconcert skinner through a series of ' outrageous ' suggestions .
" the itc did feel that the unrelenting sexual nature of the whole boy george interview , and one or two of the references in particular , had gone beyond the limits of the code . "
the programme-maker lwt said viewers should by now be well aware of the type of content to be found on this late-night show , and said there had been a warning announcement .
but the itc said the warning had been insufficient to alert viewers to the inteview 's content .
the commission turned down 17 complaints about a comedy routine in the same programme , which featured jokes about afghanistan and the taleban .
the itc said these remarks had been " justifiable satire " against a " brutal and repressive regime " .

she is stepping down as the party 's national president , due to stress and to spend time preparing her defence in her forthcoming court case .
miss hanson achieved notoriety because of her extreme views on australia 's indigenous community and asylum seekers .
her decision to abandon politics comes four months before she is due to face magistrates in brisbane charged with fraudulently registering her party and dishonestly obtaining $ 250,000 in electoral funding .
she will appear along with a former one nation director , david ettridge .
the former fish and chip shop owner was elected to australia 's upper house in 1996 , but lost her seat two years later .
uncompromising views among the targets of her outspoken views were multiculturalism , asian immigrants and australia 's aboriginal people who , she claimed , received too many welfare payments from the government and did little to help themselves .
her opinions on asylum seekers were equally uncompromising .
ms hanson called them common criminals and queue jumpers and said they did not deserve australia 's compassion .
her anti-immigration rhetoric caused widespread offence , but did strike a cord with sections of the conservative , white population .
the party polled up to 10 % of votes in last year 's state elections in queensland and western australia .
support has been steadily falling since then .
miss hanson failed again to win a senate seat at last year 's federal election .
lasting influence one senior one nation official said pauline hanson would be missed , but insisted she had left her mark on politics .
he may be right .
some analysts here in australia believe the prime minister john howard won last november 's election after adopting one nation-style policies on refugees .
mr howard 's refusal to allow 400 mainly afghan asylum seekers rescued by the norwegian freighter , the tampa , into australia played a significant part in his victory at the polls .
another former one nation colleague doubted whether pauline hanson has left politics for good .
he said she was still addicted to the drug of celebrity and notoriety and would be back .
her committal hearing on fraud charges is scheduled to start in april .
if found guilty , she could face up to 10 years in prison .

spain , which currently holds the rotating presidency of the european union , has said finding new ways to revive the middle east peace process is one of its top priorities .
during his tour , mr pique will hold talks with the palestinian and israeli leaders as well as the leaders of jordan , egypt , syria and lebanon .
mr pique 's visit comes at a difficult time of renewed tension in the region .
spain 's diplomatic mission to the middle east , following hot on the heels of the latest visit to the region by the american special envoy , anthony zinni , may signal a new determination to secure a lasting truce between israel and the palestinians .
but the signs are not particularly good .
violence between the two sides has flared again after a period of relative calm .
general zinni 's most recent peace effort was overshadowed by the israeli capture of a ship carrying weapons .
the israelis say the weapons were destined for the palestinian authority ; but the palestinian leader , yasser arafat , has denied he had anything to do with the ship .
then last week , four israeli soldiers were killed in a raid carried out by members of the hamas militant organisation .
israel responded by ripping up the runway at gaza airport , shelling gaza harbour and bulldozing palestinian houses .
before leaving for the middle east , mr pique told the arabic newspaper al-hayat that israel 's actions could not be justified in any way , an early indication perhaps of the tone of things to come .
