the women , ann daniels , caroline hamilton and pom oliver , had been " ready " to begin the 500-mile trip from resolute bay , northern canada , to the north pole on tuesday .
but a spokesman for the expedition said extreme conditions and poor visibility had forced a 36-hour delay early on monday .
the bad weather , which brought with it wind-chill temperatures of -56c , meant they could not be flown to the start point at ward hunt island .
moving ice-pack the 60-day expedition was put together by 37-year-old ms daniels , a single mother-of-three from whimple , devon .
with her are ms hamilton , 35 , from central london , and 50-year-old ms oliver from uckfield , sussex .
the women will each pull a sledge packed with 250lb of food and equipment across the constantly moving ice-pack .
the expedition is sponsored by m & g investments and its patron is the prince of wales , who personally wished them " bon voyage " when they visited him before they left .
south pole the women have been part of two other successful all-woman expeditions to the north and south poles .
they were members of a five-woman expedition which reached the south pole in january 2000 - covering 600 miles in 61 days .
in 1997 they were in a 20-woman expedition which reached the north pole in relays - a 600-mile marathon which was a first for an all-woman team .
ms hamilton and ms oliver were on the last leg of the relay which reached the north pole .
ms daniels was on the first leg , but she also set foot on the north pole when last year - as britain 's first female polar guide - she led eight men there .

the phoneline will aim to help overcome the " macho culture " which often leads to men bottling up their problems .
the executive has set aside £ 1.2m for the scheme , which will be launched in april .
it will primarily be aimed at men aged between 15 and 40 and counsellors will be available between the hours of 1800 and 0200 gmt , seven days a week .
an advertising campaign , which will include promotional beer mats as well as posters and radio adverts , is to be trialled in the glasgow area .
according to statistics scottish men and women are more likely to commit suicide linked to depression than people living south of the border .
more than 670 men committed suicide in scotland in 2000 , a figure which has risen by 250 % in the past 20 years .
the number of men consulting their gps about depression has risen by a third in the past five years to 45,000 annually .
the executive said the confidential helpline is designed to offer support at an earlier stage than other independent helpline services .
' shocking and tragic ' it is expected to eventually become part of the nhs 24 advice service , which will be launched in the north-east of scotland later this year .
health minister malcolm chisholm said : " the level of suicide and depression among young men in scotland is both shocking and tragic .
" the reasons why so many young men feel the need to harm themselves are complex .
" that 's why we need a broad range of support services to help young people before their mental health problems get out of control . "

moss bros has snapped up philip mountford , uk managing director for fashion house versace , as group managing director .
the appointment comes only three weeks after adrian wright , a former head at the giant bluewater shopping centre , took over as moss bros chief executive .
and it follows repeated rejections by moss bros of overtures from joe bloggs founder shami ahmed .
deadline set mr ahmed latest snub came on thursday , when moss bros directors dismissed his latest approach over " uncertainty " concerns , including doubts over whether cash was available to back it .
" if the prospective offeror has financing , it should make a formal offer , " moss bros chairman keith hamill said .
" otherwise it should let the company get on with its job . "
uk takeover chiefs on friday gave mr ahmed until 5 april to make a formal bid .
turnaround plan the rumpus follows a difficult time for moss bros , which last year reported its first annual loss for 25 years .
sales at the firm , which owns the cecil gee brand and runs outlets under the moss bros , canali and hugo boss names , were hit by the economic slowdown .
mr mountford said he had " full confidence " in the turnaround strategy being pursued by mr wright .
" moss bros have some exceptional brands and retail sites and i look forward to working with the rest of the management team to help realise the value of the business , " mr mountford said .

unless core issues of marginalisation and disempowerment are addressed , the end result of responding to terror with violence will be increased support for groups like al-qaeda " oxford research group report broadening the war on terror from afghanistan to iraq , they believe , could provoke baghdad into first use of chemical or biological weapons .
endless conflict , they argue , will be the consequence of meeting terror with violence .
the two academics are professor paul rogers , of bradford university 's peace studies department , and dr scilla elworthy , director of the oxford research group -lrb- org -rrb- .
six months on from the attacks on the us , the org has published their appraisal of what has been achieved , entitled never-ending war ? : consequences of september 11 .
the authors say antagonism towards the us from al-qaeda and its allies had been developing for more than a decade , fuelled by the politics of the gulf region after the 1991 war against iraq .
the gulf holds two-thirds of the world 's known oil reserves : us dependence on imported oil rose from 12.5 % of consumption in 1970 to 60.9 % in 2000 .
' unacceptable control ' the report notes " a widespread belief that the us ... -lsb- is -rsb- exerting an unacceptable control over the gulf states because of its determination to maintain security of oil supplies " .
it contrasts this with an american focus on seeing al-qaeda " simply as fundamentalists acting from motives of sheer hatred for the us and all it stood for " .
in afghanistan itself , the authors say , russia has now regained significant influence as a consequence of the war .
they add that far more people , many of them innocent , have died there from the war 's direct and indirect effects than in the attacks on new york and washington .
and they also say that the fbi believes the war has robbed al-qaeda of only 30 % of its capabilities .
the authors say al-qaeda 's aims are to evict western troops from the gulf and to replace saudi arabia 's rulers " with what would be considered a legitimate islamic regime " .
it would have expected the us to respond with great force after 11 september , and to increase its troops in the middle east and south-west asia substantially , inciting further anti-american feeling .
this is just what has happened , with sizeable us forces now in uzbekistan , tajikistan and kyrgyzstan , and an initial deployment in georgia .
iraqi threat the authors add : " moreover , in a development that must be hugely welcomed by the al-qaeda network , the us has developed a much stronger support for the sharon government in israel . "
so the report says al-qaeda is " substantially capable of further action " , and us support for israel is producing " a widespread anti-american mood " .
to attack iraq " should be expected to lead to the use of any weapons of mass destruction that the regime might be able to muster " , with great risk to us forces , gulf state civilians and israel .
the report concludes that no state can promote a global economy while at the same time acting exclusively in its own perceived interest .
nor can the world afford the double standards which allow united nations security council members to have nuclear weapons , but nobody else .
the authors conclude : " unless core issues of marginalisation and disempowerment are addressed , the end result of responding to terror with violence will be increased support for groups like al-qaeda , and an expanded cycle of violence . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- australia cuts deal in steel row categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics monday , 11 march , 2002 , 08:10 gmt australia cuts deal in steel row the eu has begun the battle to protect european steel interests australia has reached a deal with the us government to protect its steel exports from a 30 % tariff increase imposed by the us president last week .
australian prime minister john howard said he expects the bulk of australia 's steel exports to the united states to escape the new tariffs , but did not make clear if other countries would benefit from the deal .
the decision by us president george w bush to increase anti-dumping tariffs on steel imports to last week sparked international anger .
international dispute the european union said it would challenge the us tariffs by taking a case to the world trade organisation 's dispute panel , as did japan .
australia and new zealand were reportedly filing a joint submission to the wto .
mr howard 's announcement of a special deal appears to break ranks with this joint approach , analysts said .
the australian prime minister told parliament talks had won an exemption for australian exports of hot rolled steel , an important product for one of the country 's biggest firms , bhp billiton .
steel slab , another major product for billiton , was not included in the tariffs .
billiton to benefit " understandings have been reached with the us administration over the weekend which will allow australian exports of hot rolled steel products to the us west coast to proceed , " said mr howard .
" this decision , combined with the tariff rate quota on australian slab steel exports , should preserve about 85 % of australia 's steel exports to the united states . "
australia exports $ 234m of steel a year to the us and analysts feared the tariffs would have hit about half that market .
pacific problem meanwhile , another pacific steel producer reported a steep drop in profits due to the slower world economy combined with pressure from cheap imports .
china 's giant baoshan iron and steel , said its net income fell 14.4 % to $ 309m .
baoshan warned sales could be lower this year as japanese and korean foundries - the main targets of the us ruling - divert their production into its markets .
" the us decision has indirectly placed pressure on chinese steelmakers such as baoshan " , said analyst cynthia zhang of bank of china international in shanghai .
baoshan , which is china 's biggest and profitable steelmaker , directly exports only 5 % of its output to the us .
