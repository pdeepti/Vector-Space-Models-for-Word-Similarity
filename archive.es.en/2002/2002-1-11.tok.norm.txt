demonstrators overturned cars , lit fires in the street and threw stones at police , who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets to force about 1,000 people back from the presidential palace .
tens of thousands of demonstrators converged on the central square , in the first major protest since eduardo duhalde became president on 2 january .
the peso is expected to plunge when trading resumes at 1000 -lrb- 1300 gmt -rrb- on friday following a three-week freeze imposed to prevent volatile trading .
the government has put an end to 10 years of enforced parity with the us dollar in a bid to save the collapsing economy .
the protests began in neighbourhoods across buenos aires when people came onto their balconies bashing pots and pans and saucepan lids - anything that would add to the ear-splitting noise .
then , in what appeared to be a spontaneous move , the demonstrators marched to the plaza de mayo , the main square in front of government house .
old-age pensioners , families and people in wheelchairs were among their ranks as calls were made for the resignation of the government and supreme court judges .
new peso thursday night 's protests seem to have been provoked in part by the government 's announcement of its short-term plan to protect banks from mass withdrawals by panicking depositors .
new banking measures banks must switch current accounts above $ 10,000 and savings accounts above $ 3,000 into fixed-term deposits dollar deposits will only be returned to savers from jan 2003 smaller accounts will be able to convert dollars into pesos at the official exchange rate of 1.4 pesos to $ 1 smaller accounts can be accessed , but will be subject to withdrawal limits bank loans and mortgages of less than $ 100,000 will be converted into pesos banks must re-negotiate a cut in interest rates on all foreign currency loans trading in the devalued peso had been due to restart on thursday but the central bank said the government had been too slow in implementing the last details of its economic plan .
a dual exchange system is being introduced whereby the peso will have a fixed exchange rate for government and international operations , and a value set by the markets for all other transactions .
currency operations were suspended and banking restrictions introduced after the former president , fernando de la rua , resigned at the height of the protests over austerity measures aimed at ending the economic crisis .
under the new currency system , the peso - which was previously pegged at one-to-one to the dollar - will be devalued by almost 30 % .
the devalued peso will stand at 1.4 to the dollar for international transactions , but argentines will be forced to purchase dollars at a freely floating exchange rate .
some analysts believe the system is flawed , and investors had become increasingly nervous while the currency market remained closed .
export boon devaluation is expected to ease pressure on argentina 's exporters by making their products more competitive on the international markets .
importers , however , will be hurt by the 30 % devaluation of the currency - although the controlled exchange rate is designed to prevent the price of imported goods from rising in an inflationary spiral .
the government will allow people to convert dollar loans or mortgages under $ 100,000 into pesos to protect them from the devaluation .
but for ordinary argentinians , the near future looks bleak .
" if the government does n't solve this situation soon , there will be violence , " said irene fernandez , 43 , a social assistant among the protesters in buenos aires .

the deadline for equitable life policyholders to vote by post has now passed , with postal votes required to reach the insurer by wednesday morning .
the members are deciding whether to give the go-ahead for a compromise deal , a last-ditch rescue attempt to safeguard the future solvency of the mutual .
equitable life lost a court case against its own policy holders who were outraged that the insurer tried to reduce the returns on investments they had originally promised .
the lost court case - and the need to pay its policy holders in full - forced the equitable to close its doors to new business in december 2000 and sell part of its business to the halifax last february .
an agreement over the compromise deal will also secure an additional £ 250m from the halifax , if it can be reached by 1 march 2002 .
digesting the deal the compromise deal has won the support of the national association of pension funds , whose chairman peter thompson , has written to group pension scheme trustees urging them to vote yes .
about 485,000 individual policyholders and 6,000 group scheme trustees have had just under one month to digest the final scheme 's details .
the deal will only go ahead if , in all three voting classes , policyholders support the deal by more than 50 % in number and more than 75 % by value of those voting .
if these thresholds are not reached in any class , the deal will fail .
the rescue package means the so called gar policyholders will get 17.5 % on top of their policy value in exchange for giving up their right to guaranteed annuity rates .
non-gar policyholders will receive a 2.5 % increase in their policy 's value , but must sign away their right to sue the society .

the deadline for equitable life policyholders to vote by post has now passed , with postal votes required to reach the insurer by wednesday morning .
the members are deciding whether to give the go-ahead for a compromise deal , a last-ditch rescue attempt to safeguard the future solvency of the mutual .
equitable life lost a court case against its own policy holders who were outraged that the insurer tried to reduce the returns on investments they had originally promised .
the lost court case - and the need to pay its policy holders in full - forced the equitable to close its doors to new business in december 2000 and sell part of its business to the halifax last february .
an agreement over the compromise deal will also secure an additional £ 250m from the halifax , if it can be reached by 1 march 2002 .
digesting the deal the compromise deal has won the support of the national association of pension funds , whose chairman peter thompson , has written to group pension scheme trustees urging them to vote yes .
about 485,000 individual policyholders and 6,000 group scheme trustees have had just under one month to digest the final scheme 's details .
the deal will only go ahead if , in all three voting classes , policyholders support the deal by more than 50 % in number and more than 75 % by value of those voting .
if these thresholds are not reached in any class , the deal will fail .
the rescue package means the so called gar policyholders will get 17.5 % on top of their policy value in exchange for giving up their right to guaranteed annuity rates .
non-gar policyholders will receive a 2.5 % increase in their policy 's value , but must sign away their right to sue the society .
voting procedure in the compromise scheme , gars vote once .
but a legal technicality means that non-gars will vote twice .
on 11 january 2002 , the gar meeting will start at 11am , and from 2pm for non-gars , at the wembley conference centre in middlesex .
those voting in person must bring their admission card .
the result of the vote is expected at the end of january .

dr mahathir said he told japan 's prime minister junichiro koizumi he was concerned about the impact of the yen 's fall on other asian currencies at their meeting on 10 january .
malaysia 's ringgit has been pegged to at 3.8 to the us dollar since the asian financial crisis of 1997 , but dr mahathir said malaysia may need to " re-think " the peg .
the japanese yen has dropped more than 10 % against the us dollar in the past two months since japan was officially confirmed in recession .
piling on pressure japan 's government has done little to halt the yen 's slide to 39-month lows , and is thought to favour a weaker currency to support exports , analysts say .
mr koizumi " did not really give an assurance but he indicated , of course , that they will try to ensure the yen does n't depreciate any more , " the malaysian prime minister said .
dr mahathir said a yen exchange rate of 140 to the dollar could trigger devaluation in malaysia - a level japan 's former top financial diplomat has said could be breached by the end of march .
dr mahathir said he was particularly concerned about the prospect of china , a giant manufacturer of cheap goods which competes with south-east asian exporters , devaluing its currency under pressure from a sliding yen .
china fears " i 'm worried because it may cause china to devalue , and if china devalues then of course it will force us to rethink about our ringgit peg " .
the yen 's fall helps japanese goods to undercut malaysia 's high tech goods in the us and europe .
china is a competitor in other manufactured goods and basic commodities .
it 's currency , the yuan , is not generally convertible but for trade purposes it is exchanged at between 8.2770 to 8.2800 to the dollar .
lower yen forecast the yen hit a fresh low of 133.37 to the dollar on wednesday but has since recovered slightly .
it was trading at 132.35 to the dollar at 0745 gmt on friday .
eisuke sakakibara , ex-vice minister for international affairs at the japanese finance ministry , said on thursday he expects the yen to dive to 140 to the dollar by the end of march because japan 's " economic fundamentals are extremely weak now " .

the proposal from a liberal democrat peer - which would also apply to unmarried heterosexual couples - could see two gay people getting legal recognition for their relationship .
couples who are in long and enduring relationships should be able to have their relationships recognised lord lester backed by gay rights group stonewall , lord lester 's bill proposes the establishment of " civil partnerships " , provides for the registration of the partnership and sets out the ensuing legal consequences .
the bill , which also contains a provision for terminating such a partnership , was launched in the lords on thursday with a second reading debate set for 25 january .
currently the rights enjoyed by married couples , such as the automatic right of inheritance in the event of a spouse dying intestate or the right of succession to certain tenancies and to pension funds , are denied to non-married couples .
' not like marriage ' lord lester said : " couples who are in long and enduring relationships should be able to have their relationships recognised . "
the law in this country is unnecessarily cruel and discriminatory angela mason , stonewall executive director although the " civil partnership register " he is proposing was not " exactly like marriage " , it would give co-habitees many of the rights currently enjoyed by married couples , lord lester said .
" their property rights would be recognised - inheritance rights , pension rights and , if one of them dies , the right to get bereavement damages .
" matters of that kind would be recognised for the first time , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
lord lester said there was a popular misconception among people who co-habit that " common law " marriages were recognised in law , when this was not the case .
and new legislation was needed to bring britain into line with most other democratic countries .
' cruel and discriminatory ' stonewall 's executive director angela mason said : " there is a very strong moral and practical case for changing the law to recognise same-sex partnerships .
" the law in this country is unnecessarily cruel and discriminatory .
" this bill is not about gay marriage .
it is about allowing couples in mutually caring relationships to provide for and protect each other . "
practical issues ian burford , who together with his partner of 38 years was the first man to sign london mayor ken livingstone 's partnership register for gay couples , gave his backing lord lester 's bill .
he said there were " practical issues at the end of one 's life " , in particular death duties , hospital visits and medical rights , which made a change in the law necessary .
" people who have committed themselves to each other should have the same legal rights -lrb- as married people -rrb- , " he told the today programme .
the london partnership register is a largely symbolic instrument with no legal force .
marriage ' ideal ' hugh mckinner , chairman of the national family campaign , said he saw lord lester 's proposals as an undesirable " erosion of the differential between marriage and co-habitation . "
marriage was " an ideal " and had been proven as the best way of bringing up children , he added , and the law should be strengthened to encourage couples to stay together .
" i do n't think the way to do that is to have , in effect , a marriage contract for co-habiting couples , " he told the today programme .

speaking on bbc wales on friday , mr hammam has also announced a " war on hooliganism " at the club .
we are announcing a war on hooliganism and we hope that other people in the football world , and particularly in wales , will follow suit cardiff city chairman sam hammam neil macnamara , 37 , was sacked by the club 's security firm unisec after the revelations about his past emerged .
however , mr hammam has insisted he wants mr macnamara " by his side at cardiff city " .
" mr macnamara is a very good man , " said mr hammam " if people have been completely rehabilitated as a civilised society dictates , they are welcome and are treated with respect . "
it is believed that he is known to the national criminal intelligence service 's unit which deals with football hooliganism .
he was seen accompanying mr hammam during his controversial and " provocative " walk around the pitch in cardiff 's 2-1 victory over leeds on sunday which was dogged by violence .
mr macnamara had recently completed a 12-month ban from every football ground in the uk .
' decent man ' but mr hamman has revealed he knew about mr macnamara 's past , and described him as a " poacher turned game-keeper . "
" over a year now , he has been working for us and i knew about a couple of months ago , " said mr hammam .
" sometimes in the security business you need to employ someone who is a poacher turned gamekeeper , " he added .
" they know how hooligans think , they know who they are and they know how to deal with these situations effectively . "
mr hammam also described mr macnamara as a family man , and described his two daughters as " lovely " and " angelic " .
court fine in march 2000 , mr macnamara was arrested at cardiff city 's away match in blackpool .
he admitted a charge of threatening and abusive behaviour when he appeared before blackpool magistrates .
he was fined £ 100 , with £ 60 costs , and the court also placed the 12-month banning order on mr macnamara .
in september 1999 , mr macnamara also appeared at cardiff crown court charged with violent disorder following a match between cardiff city and millwall .
however , the case against him was dropped due to a lack of evidence .
however , a senior south wales police source is also reported as saying : " in my view , mr macnamara should not be guarding sam hammam . "
" a lot of the fans know mr macnamara is a convicted soccer yob - it will only encourage them to misbehave if they see him acting as hammam 's minder , " added the source .
hooliganism debate hammam has also said he is committed to ridding the club of hooliganism .
" on saturday , we are announcing a war on hooliganism and we hope that other people in the football world , and particularly in wales , will follow suit , " said mr hammam .
" cardiff should be a major premier league clube , but we can not be there if hooligans are going to continue ruling , " he added .
following the violence at sunday 's match , a top-level summit is to be held on friday between the football associations of england and wales .
it is expected that cardiff will face disciplinary action but leeds could also find themselves reprimanded over the behaviour of their fans .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- sales rise at matalan and austin reed categories tv radio communicate where i live index search you are in : business front page world uk uk politics business market data economy companies e-commerce your money business basics sci / tech health education entertainment talking point in depth audiovideo services daily e-mail news ticker mobiles / pdas feedback help low graphics friday , 11 january , 2002 , 08:51 gmt sales rise at matalan and austin reed matalan 's discount clothes have helped sales figures two more british retailers from opposite ends of the spectrum have reinforced evidence that british shoppers remain keen to spend .
discount group matalan , which has generated a breakneck performance over the past few years , said its trading in the five weeks to 5 january 2002 was up 31.7 % on the same period last year .
austin reed 's sales more sharply than had been expected on a like-for-like basis , which compares sales only at stores open this time last year , the retailer 's sales grew 9.2 % .
meanwhile , luxury clothier austin reed saw its sales for the same period rise 6 % on a like-for-like basis and 7 % overall , a better performance than analysts were expecting .
for the 21 weeks to 5 january , austin reed revenues were up 3 % and 2 % like-for-like , while matalan 's were 34.6 % higher , or 6.9 % like-for-like .
back from the dip for matalan , the figures mark something of a return to form after an update on trading in october which had sector watchers worried .
at that point , the west lancashire-based firm said like-for-like growth in the first nine weeks of the second half of this year was just 5.2 % , down from 10 % during the previous year thanks to cannibalisation of sales from old stores by new ones .
the company also lost its chief executive , as its share price more than halved from a high of 800p .
still , the concern remains that margins - the ratio of profits to earnings - have slipped as a result of discounting that was even heavier than usual and a move in the pattern of sales towards slimmer-margin homeware from more profitable clothing .
some analysts said they were considering downgrading their profit predictions as a consequence .

up to 50,000 more people die in the uk during the winter months than in the summer , according to new research .
wrapping up warm and keeping moving when hanging about in the cold really can save your life professor william keatinge most deaths caused by the cold are from strokes and coronary thrombosis in people aged over 55 rather than flu , said professor william keatinge , of london 's queen mary and westfield college .
" many people here simply do not take the cold seriously and appreciate the danger it poses .
" simple things like wrapping up warm and keeping moving when hanging about in the cold really can save your life , " he said .
fuel poverty even in the city of yakutsk in siberia , where temperatures plummet to -40c , there are fewer deaths than britain in winter .
he said the deaths are triggered by a thickening of the blood when people are exposed to the cold , and are often not attributed to the weather conditions .
flu is only to blame for 2.4 % of the deaths in winter , due to wider immunisation and fewer new viral strains .
in his research , published in the british medical journal , professor keatinge argued more government money is needed to be put into tackling fuel poverty .
and the charity friends of the earth has called for a national programme to fight fuel poverty , for example through better home insulation .
foe co-ordinator martyn williams said : " this research highlights once again the scandal of excess winter deaths in britain .
" they are a consequence of cold weather - and to the poor state of our housing stock compared to other european countries " .
