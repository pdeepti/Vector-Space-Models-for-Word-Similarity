asif iqbal , 20 , and shafiq rasul , 24 , were taken to the maximum security prison at the us navy base in guantanamo bay , cuba , after being captured in afghanistan , officials confirmed .
the men are alleged to belong to a hardline islamic group based in the small west midlands town of tipton , and to have travelled to afghanistan to fight after 11 september , according to a report in the sunday times .
they are being held alongside at least one other briton , feroz abbasi , 22 , from croydon , south london , who was named by officials last week .
i understand that they have no complaints about their condition and this is being conveyed to their families adrian bailey , mp on sunday us defence secretary donald rumsfeld is due to visit the camp , which has been the subject of growing international criticism .
mr rumsfeld 's trip comes as at least one us newspaper reports signs of a growing difference of opinion in the bush administration over the classification of the prisoners .
the washington times reports that secretary of state colin powell has joined those calling for the 158 men to be re-classed as prisoners of war - a status which would give them certain rights .
' satisfactory conditions ' adrian bailey , labour mp for west bromwich west , confirmed that mr iqbal and mr rasul are from his constituency .
he told the bbc they had been seen by british officials who were satisfied with their treatment .
mr bailey said : " i understand that they have no complaints about their condition and this is being conveyed to their families . "
he denied his constituency was a " hotbed for islamic extremism " , adding : " when i have visited the mosque the conversations have been about the bread and butter issues everyone has of housing , employment and education .
" i 've had no indication of the issues which seem to entertain muslim extremists .
" in my conversations with the local community leaders they are as mystified and puzzled as i am as to why two people from a long-established muslim community should be part of al-qaeda . "
reports have suggested that up to five britons are being held in the cuban camp and two in afghanistan .
but the foreign office has refused to confirm numbers until it has checked claims of british citizenship made by some prisoners .
after touring the camp a us senator said many of those being held would be sent back to their home countries .
foreign secretary jack straw has also said britain would prefer its citizens to be returned to the uk to face trial .
' illegal combatants ' colin powell 's reported call for the detainees to be made prisoners of war is apparently to be discussed by president george w bush 's national security council on monday .
any shift in policy would be a dramatic change for the us authorities , who have insisted the men are " illegal combatants " and therefore not entitled to the protections of the geneva convention .
officials have stressed , however , that the detainees are being treated in a manner which they say is consistent with the convention .
mr bush 's top legal adviser , alberto gonzales , is said to have sent a four-page secret memorandum to the president about mr powell 's call .
according to the washington times , mr gonzalez advised the new type of war being fought makes parts of the geneva convention obsolete .
since the prisoners arrived in cuba the us government has been accused of torture .
they are being kept in 8ft by 8ft cells with wire fence walls and metal roofs , and are apparently flown from afghanistan shackled at the legs and waist , wearing blacked-out goggles , ear defenders , and face masks .

cuban defence minister raul castro said only a few russians remained at the electronic listening post near the capital havana to oversee the shipping of equipment back to russia .
moscow has had a military presence on cuba for almost four decades and was paying $ 200m a year to lease the base .
the russian move has been warmly received in washington but criticised by the cubans .
' grave threat ' the decision to close russia 's largest military outpost abroad was announced in october by president putin who said it was too expensive to maintain .
putin : shutting base will save money the move followed a rapprochement between moscow and washington after the 11 september attacks on the united states .
the cuban authorities were dismayed , saying the closure of the facililty , which housed radar and electronic equipment , constituted a grave threat to the island 's security .
the base at lourdes , about 20 km -lrb- 12.5 miles -rrb- from havana , was set up in 1964 after the cuban missile crisis to monitor us military moves and communications .
about 1,500 russian technicians and military personnel and their families lived and worked at the base .
when the closure was announced , russian chief of staff general anatoly kvashnin said : " it costs $ 200m a year in rent to cuba .
for that amount , we can buy and launch 20 military satellites into space . "
but , in an official statement shortly afterwards , the cuban authorities said mr putin wanted the radar base shut down as " a special present " to us president george w bush ahead of a meeting between the two men .
sore point the us welcomed russia 's announcement as another sign the cold war was over .
the base had been a sore point in russia-us relations .
the us said it been used as a centre for spying on its operations and congress voted in 2000 to restrict financial aid to russia unless it closed the base .
denying the us spy claims , moscow has always made clear it sees the base as vital for checking whether the us has complied with disarmament treaties , and for monitoring missile launches .
mr putin has stressed the decision does not mean its relations with cuba - a key cold war ally - are being scaled down .

it has had to install 25,000 new lottery terminals as a condition of the licence and is also reducing the share it takes in profits to less than 0.5 % .
new licence shake-up 300 new staff to develop interactive games in-house sales force enlarged new software developed 25,000 new terminals installed profit share reduced in a fractious battle camelot fought off a rival bid from virgin boss sir richard branson to clinch the new term , which it enters with a new chairman - the former head of channel 4 michael grade .
but it also faces a substantial challenge to reverse four years of declining sales .
though it raised over £ 10.5bn for good causes in its first licence period - well up on the £ 9bn it had promised - interest in the twice weekly draws and scratchcard games has declined .
last november it was announced camelot 's half-year profits were down 27.3 % on the year before after ticket sales fell 6.9 % to £ 2.1bn.
court battle lottery sales traditionally go down once the initial public excitement has worn off , but camelot has also been distracted by the chaotic race to win the licence .

camelot originally said it would raise £ 15bn for good causes in the new licence period - a 50 % increase - although the commission said that was too optimistic .
there is further uncertainty ahead with the looming deregulation of gambling , which could tempt punters to have a flutter elsewhere .
camelot is pinning its hopes on a substantial relaunch planned for the spring , with a new look , new games and a heavy marketing campaign .
but charities remain concerned that declining lottery spending will hit their funding .
gerald oppenheim of the community fund , which distributes lottery money to good causes , said there would be more specific targeting in future .
" it 's worrying not just for us with potentially less money to distribute but it 's also worrying for the charities and voluntary organisations that want to apply to us for their projects , " mr oppenheim told bbc news .

it is already known that the trip , lasting from may to august , will include visits to england , scotland , wales and northern ireland .
downing street confirmed a statement will be made to the commons to give the full itinerary .
but it denied the announcement was in response to recent media reports of public apathy towards the jubilee .
one of the latest newspaper reports claims mr blair is about to intervene on the government side of the celebration planning , fearing it will amount to an embarrassing failure .
but downing street said the queen 's tour and the prime minister 's announcement had been planned for some time .
red tape fears the spokesman said there had been no applications to subsidise street parties from government funds .
last week the chairman of the queen 's golden jubilee committee , lord sterling , was forced to publicly insist the plans were well on track and that there was immense interest from around the country .
the reported fear among officials that the golden jubilee would be a pale imitation of the silver jubilee celebrations in 1977 were centred on claims street party organisers were being put off by bureaucracy .
it has also been claimed that lord sterling 's predecessor , lord levene of portsoken , left the post last august after only six months because he was appalled by the " shambolic state of preparation " .
jubilee celebrations extra bank holiday four towns given city status special garden parties for accession day babies golden jubilee tour of england , scotland , wales and n ireland new £ 5 coin to mark the golden jubilee classical concert in buckingham palace gardens pop concert in buckingham palace grounds jubilee church services beacons lit across the uk carnival pageant in the mall according to the sunday times , mr blair is poised to intervene because the government would be embarrassed if the public events it organises prove inferior to free pop and classical concerts to be held in the grounds of buckingham palace in june .
they will reportedly include performances by robbie williams , sir paul mccartney , mick jagger and phil collins .
the newspaper says the queen 's nationwide tour will start in cornwall , take in the commonwealth games in manchester and finish in lancashire .
jubilee planners have also released figures in an attempt to prove their plans are going well .
the palace is getting 140 inquiries a day for the street party " toolkit " , and 100 daily general inquiries are being made to the jubilee office lines .
the number of commitments to take part in a celebratory " chain of light " - a series of beacons which will be lit around the country - are also cheering organisers .
in 1997 there were 102 beacons .
this year there are already 420 planned across the uk and commonwealth , including one in antarctica .

katherine jenkins , 30 , from neath , is facing a second trial for alleged cocaine smuggling - to the criticism of a uk justice watchdog group - despite being cleared of the same charge under islamic law in another part of the country .
she made a fourth court appearance in connection with her new trial on sunday 27 january only for her case to be adjourned to 3 february due to the repeated non-appearance ms jenkins - who was not allowed to return to the uk for her father 's funeral after he died while she was in custody - has persistently denied the charges .
she is being tried along with two other britons , an australian and another woman in connection with what police have called an international drug smuggling ring .
all have pleaded not guilty and ms jenkins has been cleared of similar charges in another uae emirate but her case was transferred to dubai where she was initially arrested .
ms jenkins is accused of possessing 50g cocaine , hidden in the roof space of her flat .
she claims she believed the drugs had belonged to the australian defendant in the case , 25-year-old heidi de boer , and hid them after discovering ms de boer had left them in her apartment .
in her first trial at ras al khaimah in the north of the country , held under islamic or sharia law , the judges found the case against her could not be proved .
he case has been taken up by her family 's mp and europe minister peter hain .
he has written to dubai 's leader , sheik mohammad bin rashid , urging him to free ms jenkins on humanitarian grounds .
ms jenkins has been in custody for 15 months since the allegations of drug possession were made against her .
her father vivian , 56 , had died of a heart attack in november , which prompted mr hain 's involvement .
she worked for the dubai-based emirates airline at the time of her arrest and was held in custody over the christmas period at the public prosecution department and appeared in court on 30 december , and 6 and 13 january .
she is being held with two other britons , an australian woman and another woman of unknown nationality .
a uk consular official it is thought is be assisting her .
stephen jakobi , director of fair trials abroad , said : " ms jenkins has been behind bars for 15 months and has always maintained her innocence . "
she was originally tried along with four other britons , an australian and a lebanese .
two of the british women received life sentences at the original trial .
one of them , anna hamilton , has appealed against her sentence for drug-trafficking .
the lebanese defendant was jailed for four years , while the cases of the others were transferred to dubai .

katherine jenkins , 30 , from neath , is facing a second trial for alleged cocaine smuggling - to the criticism of a uk justice watchdog group - despite being cleared of the same charge under islamic law in another part of the country .
remanded : katherine jenkins still in custody she made a fourth court appearance in connection with her new trial on sunday 27 january only for her case to be adjourned to 3 february due to the repeated non-appearance ms jenkins - who was not allowed to return to the uk for her father 's funeral after he died while she was in custody - has persistently denied the charges .
she is being tried along with two other britons , an australian and another woman in connection with what police have called an international drug smuggling ring .
all have pleaded not guilty and ms jenkins has been cleared of similar charges in another uae emirate but her case was transferred to dubai where she was initially arrested .
peter hain : diplomatic efforts as her mp ms jenkins is accused of possessing 50g cocaine , hidden in the roof space of her flat .
she claims she believed the drugs had belonged to the australian defendant in the case , 25-year-old heidi de boer , and hid them after discovering ms de boer had left them in her apartment .
in her first trial at ras al khaimah in the north of the country , held under islamic or sharia law , the judges found the case against her could not be proved .
he case has been taken up by her family 's mp and europe minister peter hain .
he has written to dubai 's leader , sheik mohammad bin rashid , urging him to free ms jenkins on humanitarian grounds .
ms jenkins has been in custody for 15 months since the allegations of drug possession were made against her .
her father vivian , 56 , had died of a heart attack in november , which prompted mr hain 's involvement .
she worked for the dubai-based emirates airline at the time of her arrest and was held in custody over the christmas period at the public prosecution department and appeared in court on 30 december , and 6 and 13 january .
she is being held with two other britons , an australian woman and another woman of unknown nationality .
a uk consular official it is thought is be assisting her .
stephen jakobi , director of fair trials abroad , said : " ms jenkins has been behind bars for 15 months and has always maintained her innocence . "
she was originally tried along with four other britons , an australian and a lebanese .
the court in dubai where ms jenkins faces a second trial two of the british women received life sentences at the original trial .
one of them , anna hamilton , has appealed against her sentence for drug-trafficking .
the lebanese defendant was jailed for four years , while the cases of the others were transferred to dubai .

by the age of 43 , he was a retired millionaire , with a mansion in an affluent suburb of houston , a yacht and a young family .
his vast wealth had enabled him in may 2001 to leave behind a seemingly successful career at the energy giant enron , where he was chief strategy officer and vice chairman .
perhaps he would lived a life of moneyed leisure for years to come , had enron not collapsed last december , dragging down the reputations of its top executives with it .
the ensuing controversy surrounding enron 's implosion appears to have turned mr baxter 's charmed existence into a living nightmare .
in tears after enron 's fall , mr baxter was named in a shareholder lawsuit , which alleged that 29 people had capitalised from selling enron stock before the company collapsed .
j. clifford baxter born in amityville , new york graduated from new york university captain in the air force -lrb- 1980-1985 -rrb- received mba from columbia university -lrb- 1987 -rrb- brief stint as investment banker joined enron in 1991 retired from enron in may 2001 he was also subpoenaed by a congressional committee investigating the enron affair and was expected to give evidence .
days before his suicide , he reportedly broke down in tears while talking on the telephone to former business associate about enron .
he was also described by journalists that visited his home as dishevelled and unshaven .
friends of mr baxter said he was depressed that he might have to testify about the role his colleagues had played in the collapse of enron .
a whistle-blower ?
he was known as " ruthless " in the workplace , and even arrogant , and yet he seems to have suffered greatly from enron 's demise .
and the fact that he was named in a memo as one of the few executives who had in the past challenged enron 's questionable accounting practices adds to the mystery .
" cliff baxter complained mightily to -lsb- the then chief executive jeff -rsb- skilling and all who would listen about the inappropriateness of our transactions , " wrote sherron watkins , another enron employee .
mr baxter joined enron in 1991 after varied career in investment banking and the air force .
his early years born in amityville , new york , he graduated from new york university to join the military , where he became an air force captain from 1980 to 1985 . "
definitely a guy you wanted on your side and not against you " kevin hyatt enron director he then left the military and two years later received an mba from columbia university .
at enron , he quickly moved up the ranks and was instrumental in transforming the company from a power producer into a high-flying energy trader .
he was chairman and chief executive of enron north america before he become chief strategy officer and then vice chairman .
kevin hyatt , enron 's director of pipeline business development , described mr baxter as " one of the best mentors i 've had " .
" he was ruthless when it came to working a deal .
definitely a guy you wanted on your side and not against you , " mr hyatt added .
" but when it came to people around him , people who worked for him , he genuinely cared ... about the employees and their families . "
retirement mr baxter said he left enron to spend more time with his family - his wife carol , a 16-year old son and an 11-year old daughter .
at the time of his resignation , mr skilling praised his " creativity , intelligence , sense of humour and straightforward manner " .
like many wealthy businessmen - and indeed enron itself - mr baxter was also known for his generous contributions to charity .
tax records show that he gave money to junior achievement , which works to give school children exposure to free enterprise , the american diabetes association , american cancer society and sunshine kids .
a ' tragic loss ' but all these external facts about his life and career give few clues as to why he chose to take his own life with .38-caliber revolver in his car on 25 january .
a suicide note was found in the black mercedes-benz and reportedly mentioned enron , but police have not disclosed the contents .
his family are mourning a " beloved husband , father and friend " , while enron said that " it was deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague " .
mr baxter 's death also adds a tragic dimension to the enron saga , which has already devastated the lives of many former employees .

good morning charles .
charles kennedy : david , a very good morning , by satellite from inverness , gosh that 's a , an arresting thought is n't it .
david frost : it is an arresting thought , absolutely .
tell me what are your thoughts this , this weekend on the rose addis affair , which of the two sides are you on , or as i suspect neither ?
charles kennedy : neither , your , your suspicion is correct , i think that politics does n't really edify itself with the , the carry on that we 've seen over the last few years , last few days , it 's the war of jennifer 's ear all over again is n't it and the point of the matter is this , that if you 're a constituency mp , i 've been obviously here at home in the highlands over the weekend and doing constituency surgeries and so on , you get individuals coming to you on a private basis and some , alas , have got unfortunate stories to tell about their experience with the national health service .
well you raise that as a local mp on their behalf but that is not the generality and i think that as a party leader you 've got a wider responsibility involved and that you should n't seek to elevate one particular distressing case up to the level that leaves people with the impression that the whole system is a shambles , because it 's not , it 's still a very good national health service , could be better , should be better funded but it is not the , the totality of what iain duncan smith was suggesting .
david frost : what about another great institution , the house of lords and house of lords reform because you 're very close on several major points here to the conservatives rather than the government , about 300 , about 80 per cent elected , call it the senate and so in , there 's two points that you 'd have to sort out between you , one on the method of election and the other on the length of the elected term but you could probably trade those two .
is there an opportunity here for you to work with the tories in a way that would be much more powerful than you doing so separately and you 'd probably win in the house of lords again and again ?
charles kennedy : well this is one of the almost unspoken stories so far since the general election that if you look at the house of lords , indeed if you look at the terrorism legislation after september the 11th the government had to back down on quite a number of civil libertarian principles because the votes were n't there from the government 's point of view , that the liberal democrats , the cross-benchers and the conservatives reach a degree of common cause then the government has got to think again .
now that 's a very healthy thing i , i feel but i would say that where reform of the house of lords is concerned , yes we want a predominantly elected second chamber , it 's got an important revising function to do and i think that quite frankly the government 's proposals here are shambolic and i do n't think they 'll ever see the light of day .
david frost : have you considered cooperating with the tories on this one ?
have you had any , have any of your people had conversations with them ?
charles kennedy : yes there have been conversations between the liberal democrats and the conservatives in the house of lords and the nature of the house of lords is very different is very different from the house of commons and that there is if you like informal discussions about things on a day-by-day basis and therefore it comes as no surprise that we 've been talking about this .
there is n't some great plot at work here but i do think that if we can pressurise the government into a more democrat house of lords that would be a very good thing .
david frost : tell me something there 's rumours that you might be going to drop the 1p on income tax for education or whatever , there was a throwaway remark of yours the other day where you said you might go into the next election vowing to lower taxes , is this really a discernible trend , mark , mark open your man has said the 1p is tired , out-of-date , crude and simplistic , i mean are you thinking of , of making that move on tax ?
charles kennedy : well what we 're doing at the moment internally in terms of the liberal democrats which i 've set up since the general election is to have a sensible policy review because what we go into a next general election in three or four years time may not obviously make sense in terms of what we were saying at a previous general election , i mean the world will have moved on , it 's as simple as that .
now we 've already been a taxcutting party because we want to take people at the lower end of the taxation spectrum out of tax altogether , at the same time we have been very focused on the fact that taxation should be transparent , it should be honest and it should be accountable .
now i do n't think we 're going to depart from any of those principles but quite what our specific levels of commitments will be in terms of taxation policy and what that helps deliver in terms of quality public services , whether it 's decent railways , good hospitals , quality schools and so on , that remains to be seen .
david frost : you signalled the sort of end of the project when you were with us in december charles kennedy : yes .
david frost : and you 've spoken about it since , in terms of the next election , because obviously one of the reasons you 're not as close as you were to labour is that labour obviously does n't need you any more and therefore they wo n't give as much , but which would you rather happen at the next election charles , would you rather have 60 seats yourself but a labour majority of 150 or go down to 40 seats but a labour majority of 20 which would make you much more powerful , which would you prefer ?
charles kennedy : this is a , when did you stop beating your wife question is n't it ?
david frost : well no your fiancee i think you should say .
charles kennedy : fiancee yes indeed , the , well she 'll be watching this and she will comment on , on , on this matter in due course but the , i think the point is what i want to see is to maximise the liberal democrat input in parliament , in public life , in politics as a whole and i think that the way we do that is by taking opportunities like this discussion , to talk about what we 're in favour of , what we want to see achieved , what the potential is for our country and not spend too much time getting bogged down in what the others are up to .
david frost : but tell me in terms of a project being over and things going forward , what 's going to be your big idea for the , for the next election , someone , some people always say there 's no real big idea behind the liberals , now is the big idea of the next election supplanting the tories as the effective opposition , as the official opposition ?
charles kennedy : i think that the big idea is a composite if you wish of a set of values and an approach which adds up , which actually relates to people , we 've got to reflect upon the fact , all of us in politics whatever party , why are so many people not participating in the political process , they 're not joining political parties , they 're not bothering to vote come the election time , this is very bad news indeed and i think that if we enunciate an approach which is firmly rooted in civil liberties , looks to the future in terms of environmental policy , is international , not least where europe is concerned and is about delivering quality public services fairly funded , i think that 's something that will find a real chord with people .
david frost : in the news there there was an item about the , the three british prisoners at guantanamo bay , what do you feel about the current conditions there and some people 's suggestion that they should be brought back here to trial ?
charles kennedy : well i think there 's two points there , i think first of all that the americans , i was in new york last week and there is no doubt about the prevailing sentiment , very understandably so , within the united states as to the atrocities that took place .
the americans i think have conducted themselves and i pay tribute to tony blair because i think he 's had a , a significant role in this too , they 've conducted themselves in a sensible and a sustained measured manner in response to the awful events that , that occurred .
however they must not lose that broader global consensus which has emerged , which has been built politically and internationally and i worry that some of the images and some of the impressions that are coming out from the situation in cuba is going to unfortunately damage that and they need to think carefully .
david frost : thank you very much charles , we must conclude in the way we would all wish to do so with congratulations on your engagement to sarah .
charles kennedy : well thank you very much and on behalf of both of us much appreciated .
david frost : and she is now going to show you how to put politics in third place , the right place , yes , first of all love , then rock and roll and then politics ?
charles kennedy : that sounds quite a good agenda , yes .
david frost : thank you very much indeed .
charles kennedy : maybe that 's , maybe that 's the big idea .
david frost : charles kennedy there joining us .
thank you charles .

now that 's a very healthy thing i , i feel but i would say that where reform of the house of lords is concerned , yes we want a predominantly elected second chamber , it 's got an important revising function to do and i think that quite frankly the government 's proposals here are shambolic and i do n't think they 'll ever see the light of day .
david frost : have you considered cooperating with the tories on this one ?
have you had any , have any of your people had conversations with them ?
charles kennedy : yes there have been conversations between the liberal democrats and the conservatives in the house of lords and the nature of the house of lords is very different is very different from the house of commons and that there is if you like informal discussions about things on a day-by-day basis and therefore it comes as no surprise that we 've been talking about this .
there is n't some great plot at work here but i do think that if we can pressurise the government into a more democrat house of lords that would be a very good thing .
david frost : tell me something there 's rumours that you might be going to drop the 1p on income tax for education or whatever , there was a throwaway remark of yours the other day where you said you might go into the next election vowing to lower taxes , is this really a discernible trend , mark , mark open your man has said the 1p is tired , out-of-date , crude and simplistic , i mean are you thinking of , of making that move on tax ?
charles kennedy : well what we 're doing at the moment internally in terms of the liberal democrats which i 've set up since the general election is to have a sensible policy review because what we go into a next general election in three or four years time may not obviously make sense in terms of what we were saying at a previous general election , i mean the world will have moved on , it 's as simple as that .
now we 've already been a taxcutting party because we want to take people at the lower end of the taxation spectrum out of tax altogether , at the same time we have been very focused on the fact that taxation should be transparent , it should be honest and it should be accountable .
now i do n't think we 're going to depart from any of those principles but quite what our specific levels of commitments will be in terms of taxation policy and what that helps deliver in terms of quality public services , whether it 's decent railways , good hospitals , quality schools and so on , that remains to be seen .
david frost : you signalled the sort of end of the project when you were with us in december charles kennedy : yes .
david frost : and you 've spoken about it since , in terms of the next election , because obviously one of the reasons you 're not as close as you were to labour is that labour obviously does n't need you any more and therefore they wo n't give as much , but which would you rather happen at the next election charles , would you rather have 60 seats yourself but a labour majority of 150 or go down to 40 seats but a labour majority of 20 which would make you much more powerful , which would you prefer ?
charles kennedy : this is a , when did you stop beating your wife question is n't it ?
david frost : well no your fiancee i think you should say .
charles kennedy : fiancee yes indeed , the , well she 'll be watching this and she will comment on , on , on this matter in due course but the , i think the point is what i want to see is to maximise the liberal democrat input in parliament , in public life , in politics as a whole and i think that the way we do that is by taking opportunities like this discussion , to talk about what we 're in favour of , what we want to see achieved , what the potential is for our country and not spend too much time getting bogged down in what the others are up to .
david frost : but tell me in terms of a project being over and things going forward , what 's going to be your big idea for the , for the next election , someone , some people always say there 's no real big idea behind the liberals , now is the big idea of the next election supplanting the tories as the effective opposition , as the official opposition ?
charles kennedy : i think that the big idea is a composite if you wish of a set of values and an approach which adds up , which actually relates to people , we 've got to reflect upon the fact , all of us in politics whatever party , why are so many people not participating in the political process , they 're not joining political parties , they 're not bothering to vote come the election time , this is very bad news indeed and i think that if we enunciate an approach which is firmly rooted in civil liberties , looks to the future in terms of environmental policy , is international , not least where europe is concerned and is about delivering quality public services fairly funded , i think that 's something that will find a real chord with people .
david frost : in the news there there was an item about the , the three british prisoners at guantanamo bay , what do you feel about the current conditions there and some people 's suggestion that they should be brought back here to trial ?
charles kennedy : well i think there 's two points there , i think first of all that the americans , i was in new york last week and there is no doubt about the prevailing sentiment , very understandably so , within the united states as to the atrocities that took place .
the americans i think have conducted themselves and i pay tribute to tony blair because i think he 's had a , a significant role in this too , they 've conducted themselves in a sensible and a sustained measured manner in response to the awful events that , that occurred .
however they must not lose that broader global consensus which has emerged , which has been built politically and internationally and i worry that some of the images and some of the impressions that are coming out from the situation in cuba is going to unfortunately damage that and they need to think carefully .
david frost : thank you very much charles , we must conclude in the way we would all wish to do so with congratulations on your engagement to sarah .
charles kennedy : well thank you very much and on behalf of both of us much appreciated .
david frost : and she is now going to show you how to put politics in third place , the right place , yes , first of all love , then rock and roll and then politics ?
charles kennedy : that sounds quite a good agenda , yes .
david frost : thank you very much indeed .
charles kennedy : maybe that 's , maybe that 's the big idea .
david frost : charles kennedy there joining us .
thank you charles .

good morning charles .
charles kennedy : david , a very good morning , by satellite from inverness , gosh that 's a , an arresting thought is n't it .
david frost : it is an arresting thought , absolutely .
tell me what are your thoughts this , this weekend on the rose addis affair , which of the two sides are you on , or as i suspect neither ?
charles kennedy : neither , your , your suspicion is correct , i think that politics does n't really edify itself with the , the carry on that we 've seen over the last few years , last few days , it 's the war of jennifer 's ear all over again is n't it and the point of the matter is this , that if you 're a constituency mp , i 've been obviously here at home in the highlands over the weekend and doing constituency surgeries and so on , you get individuals coming to you on a private basis and some , alas , have got unfortunate stories to tell about their experience with the national health service .
well you raise that as a local mp on their behalf but that is not the generality and i think that as a party leader you 've got a wider responsibility involved and that you should n't seek to elevate one particular distressing case up to the level that leaves people with the impression that the whole system is a shambles , because it 's not , it 's still a very good national health service , could be better , should be better funded but it is not the , the totality of what iain duncan smith was suggesting .
david frost : what about another great institution , the house of lords and house of lords reform because you 're very close on several major points here to the conservatives rather than the government , about 300 , about 80 per cent elected , call it the senate and so in , there 's two points that you 'd have to sort out between you , one on the method of election and the other on the length of the elected term but you could probably trade those two .
is there an opportunity here for you to work with the tories in a way that would be much more powerful than you doing so separately and you 'd probably win in the house of lords again and again ?

david frost : you signalled the sort of end of the project when you were with us in december charles kennedy : yes .
david frost : and you 've spoken about it since , in terms of the next election , because obviously one of the reasons you 're not as close as you were to labour is that labour obviously does n't need you any more and therefore they wo n't give as much , but which would you rather happen at the next election charles , would you rather have 60 seats yourself but a labour majority of 150 or go down to 40 seats but a labour majority of 20 which would make you much more powerful , which would you prefer ?
charles kennedy : this is a , when did you stop beating your wife question is n't it ?
david frost : well no your fiancee i think you should say .
charles kennedy : fiancee yes indeed , the , well she 'll be watching this and she will comment on , on , on this matter in due course but the , i think the point is what i want to see is to maximise the liberal democrat input in parliament , in public life , in politics as a whole and i think that the way we do that is by taking opportunities like this discussion , to talk about what we 're in favour of , what we want to see achieved , what the potential is for our country and not spend too much time getting bogged down in what the others are up to .
david frost : but tell me in terms of a project being over and things going forward , what 's going to be your big idea for the , for the next election , someone , some people always say there 's no real big idea behind the liberals , now is the big idea of the next election supplanting the tories as the effective opposition , as the official opposition ?
charles kennedy : i think that the big idea is a composite if you wish of a set of values and an approach which adds up , which actually relates to people , we 've got to reflect upon the fact , all of us in politics whatever party , why are so many people not participating in the political process , they 're not joining political parties , they 're not bothering to vote come the election time , this is very bad news indeed and i think that if we enunciate an approach which is firmly rooted in civil liberties , looks to the future in terms of environmental policy , is international , not least where europe is concerned and is about delivering quality public services fairly funded , i think that 's something that will find a real chord with people .
david frost : in the news there there was an item about the , the three british prisoners at guantanamo bay , what do you feel about the current conditions there and some people 's suggestion that they should be brought back here to trial ?
charles kennedy : well i think there 's two points there , i think first of all that the americans , i was in new york last week and there is no doubt about the prevailing sentiment , very understandably so , within the united states as to the atrocities that took place .
the americans i think have conducted themselves and i pay tribute to tony blair because i think he 's had a , a significant role in this too , they 've conducted themselves in a sensible and a sustained measured manner in response to the awful events that , that occurred .
however they must not lose that broader global consensus which has emerged , which has been built politically and internationally and i worry that some of the images and some of the impressions that are coming out from the situation in cuba is going to unfortunately damage that and they need to think carefully .
david frost : thank you very much charles , we must conclude in the way we would all wish to do so with congratulations on your engagement to sarah .
charles kennedy : well thank you very much and on behalf of both of us much appreciated .
david frost : and she is now going to show you how to put politics in third place , the right place , yes , first of all love , then rock and roll and then politics ?
charles kennedy : that sounds quite a good agenda , yes .
david frost : thank you very much indeed .
charles kennedy : maybe that 's , maybe that 's the big idea .
david frost : charles kennedy there joining us .
thank you charles .

good morning charles .
charles kennedy : david , a very good morning , by satellite from inverness , gosh that 's a , an arresting thought is n't it .
david frost : it is an arresting thought , absolutely .
tell me what are your thoughts this , this weekend on the rose addis affair , which of the two sides are you on , or as i suspect neither ?
charles kennedy : neither , your , your suspicion is correct , i think that politics does n't really edify itself with the , the carry on that we 've seen over the last few years , last few days , it 's the war of jennifer 's ear all over again is n't it and the point of the matter is this , that if you 're a constituency mp , i 've been obviously here at home in the highlands over the weekend and doing constituency surgeries and so on , you get individuals coming to you on a private basis and some , alas , have got unfortunate stories to tell about their experience with the national health service .
well you raise that as a local mp on their behalf but that is not the generality and i think that as a party leader you 've got a wider responsibility involved and that you should n't seek to elevate one particular distressing case up to the level that leaves people with the impression that the whole system is a shambles , because it 's not , it 's still a very good national health service , could be better , should be better funded but it is not the , the totality of what iain duncan smith was suggesting .
david frost : what about another great institution , the house of lords and house of lords reform because you 're very close on several major points here to the conservatives rather than the government , about 300 , about 80 per cent elected , call it the senate and so in , there 's two points that you 'd have to sort out between you , one on the method of election and the other on the length of the elected term but you could probably trade those two .
is there an opportunity here for you to work with the tories in a way that would be much more powerful than you doing so separately and you 'd probably win in the house of lords again and again ?
charles kennedy : well this is one of the almost unspoken stories so far since the general election that if you look at the house of lords , indeed if you look at the terrorism legislation after september the 11th the government had to back down on quite a number of civil libertarian principles because the votes were n't there from the government 's point of view , that the liberal democrats , the cross-benchers and the conservatives reach a degree of common cause then the government has got to think again .
now that 's a very healthy thing i , i feel but i would say that where reform of the house of lords is concerned , yes we want a predominantly elected second chamber , it 's got an important revising function to do and i think that quite frankly the government 's proposals here are shambolic and i do n't think they 'll ever see the light of day .
david frost : have you considered cooperating with the tories on this one ?
have you had any , have any of your people had conversations with them ?
charles kennedy : yes there have been conversations between the liberal democrats and the conservatives in the house of lords and the nature of the house of lords is very different is very different from the house of commons and that there is if you like informal discussions about things on a day-by-day basis and therefore it comes as no surprise that we 've been talking about this .
there is n't some great plot at work here but i do think that if we can pressurise the government into a more democrat house of lords that would be a very good thing .
david frost : tell me something there 's rumours that you might be going to drop the 1p on income tax for education or whatever , there was a throwaway remark of yours the other day where you said you might go into the next election vowing to lower taxes , is this really a discernible trend , mark , mark open your man has said the 1p is tired , out-of-date , crude and simplistic , i mean are you thinking of , of making that move on tax ?
charles kennedy : well what we 're doing at the moment internally in terms of the liberal democrats which i 've set up since the general election is to have a sensible policy review because what we go into a next general election in three or four years time may not obviously make sense in terms of what we were saying at a previous general election , i mean the world will have moved on , it 's as simple as that .
now we 've already been a taxcutting party because we want to take people at the lower end of the taxation spectrum out of tax altogether , at the same time we have been very focused on the fact that taxation should be transparent , it should be honest and it should be accountable .

david frost : in the news there there was an item about the , the three british prisoners at guantanamo bay , what do you feel about the current conditions there and some people 's suggestion that they should be brought back here to trial ?
charles kennedy : well i think there 's two points there , i think first of all that the americans , i was in new york last week and there is no doubt about the prevailing sentiment , very understandably so , within the united states as to the atrocities that took place .
the americans i think have conducted themselves and i pay tribute to tony blair because i think he 's had a , a significant role in this too , they 've conducted themselves in a sensible and a sustained measured manner in response to the awful events that , that occurred .
however they must not lose that broader global consensus which has emerged , which has been built politically and internationally and i worry that some of the images and some of the impressions that are coming out from the situation in cuba is going to unfortunately damage that and they need to think carefully .
david frost : thank you very much charles , we must conclude in the way we would all wish to do so with congratulations on your engagement to sarah .
charles kennedy : well thank you very much and on behalf of both of us much appreciated .
david frost : and she is now going to show you how to put politics in third place , the right place , yes , first of all love , then rock and roll and then politics ?
charles kennedy : that sounds quite a good agenda , yes .
david frost : thank you very much indeed .
charles kennedy : maybe that 's , maybe that 's the big idea .
david frost : charles kennedy there joining us .
thank you charles .
