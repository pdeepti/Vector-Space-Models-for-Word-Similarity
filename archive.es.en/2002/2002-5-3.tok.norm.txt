to shouts of glee from supporters and flashes from dozens of cameras , two candidates from the far-right british national party celebrated winning the group 's first council seats for almost 10 years .
it began quietly , with candidates and reporters crowding around the counting tables to try to assess how the night would develop .
and it ended amid chaotic scenes as one of the victorious bnp candidates was swept out of the building by supporters , refusing to answer questions .
bnp activists pushed reporters away as they tried to ask questions , and then guarded carol hughes ' car to stop photographers taking pictures of her .
' where everybody counts ' bnp leaders said that when they arrived for the count among the cricket nets and basketball hoops at the turf moor stadium 's leisure centre , they had not expected to win a seat .
but they were being coy .
and as the clock approached 0300 they had two seats in the bag and have high hopes for a recount in another ward , which will be held on friday morning . "
it is a sad day for burnley and a sad day for britain " rafique malik labour councillor reporters had packed the sports hall as the count began under a banner proclaiming : " burnley - where everyone counts . "
the first surprise was the turnout , unexpectedly high at 53 % .
then there was speculation of an early success for the bnp in the gawthorpe ward , but shortly after midnight , it was announced that ex-paratrooper andrew kenyon had failed to win a seat by just 85 votes .
police stepped in but bnp disappointment at that result turned to joy about an hour later as david edwards , a 40-year-old civil engineer , won in cliviger with worsthorne .
as he and his supporters celebrated , a small group of protesters moved in waving anti-nazi league posters , with police stepping in to keep the two sides apart .
with three candidates elected to each ward in burnley , the bnp had targeted the area heavily , putting up 13 candidates in the 15 wards .
mr edwards polled 898 votes , beating off the labour challenge to be elected along with a conservative and an independent .
but the victorious candidate was ushered away by supporters immediately after the result , refusing to answer questions .
hurried out and the same thing happened about an hour later when carol hughes , a 38-year-old former labour supporter , was rushed into the cold night air and into a waiting car after winning a seat in rosegrove with lowerhouse .
she polled 751 votes , and was elected with a labour candidate and an independent , with two other labour hopefuls trailing .
a former care worker , she is a section leader in a local car parts production factory .
she simply smiled and said she felt " great " before being hurried out of the building .
on her election leaflet , she denied being a racist and said labour had lost touch with the people of burnley .
' nice surprise ' bnp supporters said the winning candidates would not talk to the media because they felt the party had been unfairly treated .
there were angry exchanges with reporters as mrs hughes faced a barrage of questions .
the deputy leader of the bnp in burnley , simon bennett said the results were a " nice surprise " .
" i walked in here tonight expecting to come out with no councillors , " he told reporters gathered at the count .
" the people of the area have voted for the policies we were offering because they think they are the best policies to solve burnley 's problems . "
' sad day ' he said that other parties must accept the result and added : " i put out a plea to them to respect the democratic wishes of the people . "
but labour councillor rafique malik , who was elected for the danehouse area , told bbc news online : " it is a sad day for burnley and a sad day for britain .
" but the fact of the matter is some members of our community are very unhappy - either about the way they are being not listened to or not responded to .
" this result will tarnish the name of burnley , " he said .
" i am afraid the bnp has a track record of ripping communities apart .
they must remember that the british people do not tolerate extremism . "
hopes bnp leader nick griffin , who was at another count , said : " it is very good news for us .
it is an amazing victory . "
the bnp victories are the first time a far right candidate has won a seat since derek beackon in the london borough of tower hamlets in 1993 .
the party came fourth in seven burnley wards and has high hopes for the gannow seat , where a recount will take place on friday .
in the 19 seats contested by the bnp so far across the country for which there are results , the bnp have scored an average of 18 % .
this suggests its win in burnley may be more than an isolated flash in the pan .

a young woman smiling at her baby .
an old man with a mischievous grin and a twinkle in his eye .
a couple out shopping for the day .
rarely can a town have been so badly let down you do n't expect to hear them spitting out the poison that the british national party nurtures in burnley .
but spit it out they do .
" we 've got to stand up for ourselves , " says the young woman .
" they live in this country , they should live like us , " says the woman laden with shopping bags .
" too much money is going to the asian community . "
" i was born and bred here , " says the elderly man .
" and i feel i have no control , i feel usurped . "
sometimes when people are searching for answers , they make very bad choices .
and make no mistake , the people of burnley have every reason to be angry .
rarely can a town have been so badly let down .
and the over-riding feeling on the streets is that little has changed since clashes between white and asian youths in the town hit the headlines last year .
frustrations the report of the burnley task force , which was set up after the disturbances , seems to have made little impression on people in both communities .
many are angry , alienated from slick politics and pessimistic about the future .
the bnp has won backing they see labour as having done little for them , locally or nationally .
they say the liberal democrats are just labour by another name .
and this town is no tory stronghold .
it 's just that the bnp is certainly not the answer to their frustrations .
for a start , burnley 's problems have much more to do with urban neglect , with poverty , with poor housing , with unemployment , with drugs and with crime than with race .
yet it is clear that the repugnant tactics of the bnp have made an impression among the white community here by scapegoating the asian community , capitalising on discontent and spreading misinformation .
defiance just as white racists were accused of attempting to turn last year 's clashes - sparked by gang warfare - into racial confrontation .
in the town centre on wednesday , most people ignored the anti-nazi league demonstration on the bandstand .
one woman took a leaflet and read it out loud : " do n't vote bnp ! "
she turned to her friend .
" well , i am , " she squawked defiantly , crumpling the piece of paper in her fist and throwing it in a bin .
not everyone is as blatant .
but the sentiments expressed by many in the town centre have a similar ring to them .
" we are all talking about the bnp , " says a young woman .
" most of my friends are supporting them .
we do n't feel the white community get a fair deal . "
depressing " nothing has changed , " she says when asked about the impact of last year 's troubles and the subsequent inquiry .
" there is still a lot of tension . "
ken sanders says that if anything , things have got worse since last year 's troubles .
" people are just more aware that things are n't right , " he says .
harold bowers makes no excuse for his support for the bnp .
" they ought to be given a chance .
there is too much money spent on the ethnic minorities . "
it is a claim repeated with depressing regularity , even among those who said they were not voting bnp on thursday .
the facts about how money is spent in burnley fail , of course , to back up the claims of unfairness to white areas .
powerless much of the money available to the area can only be spent according to strict rules and is spread across the borough of 91,000 people .
a pub damaged in the clashes has now reopened where more is spent on areas where the town 's asian community of around 5,000 live , it is not preferential treatment - it is because they are some of the poorest streets in england .
in stoneyholme , part of the predominantly asian daneshouse ward , the community is also concerned that little has changed since last year 's violence .
there is the same sense of powerlessness , that no-one is listening .
" some of the leaders are not bad , " says a man working on his car .
" but collectively , they have not done enough .
they must work harder . "
" they all promised changes , " says a young woman peering from behind her front door .
" but we have n't seen any really .
i hope this year they really mean what they say . "
' grassroots ' for rafique malik , burnley 's deputy mayor and a daneshouse councillor , this goes to the heart of the problem .
" information is not getting down to the grassroots , " he says .
" there are a lot of good projects , but many people do n't know what is happening , who is doing what .
" we want more power from central government .
they are on the right path by talking about regional assemblies , but it has to move down to the grassroots . "
he talks about councils for every ward , with budgets of around Â£ 50,000 a year and the power to make decisions about the area where they live .
attempts clearly are being made , of course , to address the recommendations of the burnley task force , headed by lord tony clarke .
improvements the report called on national and local government to pay more attention to the needs of the community in burnley , to improve the way information is delivered , to take urgent action to improve housing and to promote better community relations .
there have been more improvements in housing .
the town 's community alliance is bringing groups from across the community together .
new ways of delivering information , such as a new magazine , burnley life , are being examined .
there are also signs that money earmarked for regeneration in the town is taking effect : a new bus station almost finished , canalside developments , a new shopping complex .
yet no-one would pretend that any of this disguises burnley 's very real problems .
there are pockets of very high unemployment , while wages for those in work are low .
in inner burnley 15 % of properties are vacant , 27 % are unfit as homes .
forty percent of homes rely on some form of state benefit .
poverty is a serious problem , as is ill health , drug and alcohol misuse and crime .
' real problem ' " it 's not race that 's the problem , mate , " says a young white teenager hunched on his bike at the top of one of the sloping terraced streets of danehouse .
" it 's the criminals , it 's the drugs .
the people who go shoplifting , the ones who rob houses .
nothing to do with race .
whites do it , asians do it . "
a taxi driver passing rows of boarded up houses on the other side of town says the same .
" if i come on a job up here , it will be about drugs , " he says .
" that 's the real problem . "
on the other side of the pennines , a short train journey away , bradford also saw disturbances last year .
many there say little has changed since , yet the city seems somehow more self confident than burnley .
the vibrant city centre is filled with adverts for its bid to become european city of culture in 2008 .
everyone recognises the city has problems , but somehow you get the feeling that bradford will make it through a difficult period .
' beautiful place ' it contrasts sharply with the sense of weariness and powerlessness on the bleak streets of burnley .
change will take time , of course and last year 's clashes at least brought the scale of the problem into sharp focus .
amir mirza , writing in the latest issue of burnley life , sums up the challenge facing the town .
" i love burnley , even with all its sham , drudgery and broken windows ; it can still be a beautiful place .
" if there is one all-important finding of the task force , it is this - the future of our town is in our hands .
the question is , do we care enough to make a difference ? "

the showpiece event with a worldwide tv audience of 2.5 billion offers an excellent marketing opportunity and mean all eyes will once again be on the welsh capital .
the worthington cup final is also played in cardiff london heavyweights arsenal and chelsea will battle for the sport 's most glamorous prize before 72,000 fans .
it is the second time the glittering stadium has deputised for the defunct wembley , which is being demolished .
last year 's match was the first time the final had been played away from london since 1922 and everything went like clockwork .
arsenal , however , were deprived of the cup by two late goal 's from liverpool 's michael owen .
this year , the authorities expect more than 70,000 fans to make the trip from london to support their teams .
following last year 's success , the procedure for policing and masterminding such a big event is well-oiled .
heavy congestion the stadium has been fitted with a new playing surface to avoid the kind of criticism levelled at stadium managers used to preparing for rugby games .
off the pitch , a masterplan to avoid confrontations is in place .
fans who arrive from england by road will be sent in different directions from the m4 motorway .
the welsh assembly is to have roadworks lifted wherever possible but heavy congestion is still expected .
the stereophonics are one of a number of bands to play the stadium for fans arriving by train , first great western is doubling the number of services from london .
extra staff have been drafted in and the company has taken the step of banning alcohol on the trains .
once they arrive at cardiff , fans will be marshalled under a crowd control queuing system - police are warning long waits can be expected .
the impact of staging such a huge bank holiday event on the hospitality trade is also clear .
most hotels in the city have been fully booked for months and many bars have taken on extra staff to cope with the expected rush .
some restaurants and cafÃ©s in the city centre are also planning to open early to encourage as many people as possible to arrive early .

mr roberts , consignia chief executive since 1995 , will step down from his post once the government has found a successor , the financial times said .
the report comes as consignia , the re-named post office , prepares for the complete dismantling of its monopoly under government plans to liberalise postal services .
the loss-making company is mid-way through a radical restructuring programme aimed at shedding up to 30,000 jobs and closing a third of the urban post office network .
denial the ft named marisa cassoni , group finance director of britannic assurance , as one likely candidate to replace mr roberts .
the paper claimed that some officials favoured giving the job to a figure with an " entrepreneurial " background .
the uk government and consignia have both denied that mr roberts , who joined the post office in 1967 , is under pressure to step down .
consignia has been hit hard in recent years by competition in some segments of the postal services market , and by declining mail volumes linked to the rise of electronic communication .
strike called off the company has also been dogged by labour disputes .
on thursday , a national postal workers ' strike planned for 8 may was narrowly averted when consignia reached a preliminary agreement over pay with the communication workers ' union -lrb- cwu -rrb- .
under the deal , which still requires the backing of cwu members , consignia staff would be given a 2.2 % pay rise backdated to october last year , and a further 2.3 % from october 2002 .
consignia 's losses were running as high as Â£ 1.5m a day during one three-month period last year .
under the government 's plans to liberalise postal services , the company 's monopoly would be dismantled in three phases by 2006 .

unexpected expected all the mainstream leaders had urged people to go out and vote to stop the bnp , particularly in the wake of jean marie le pen 's first round success in the french presidential election .
unlike le pen , the bnp has never been more than a fringe group in british politics .

in its closely-watched monthly house price survey , the country 's biggest mortgage lender said uk property prices posted " further significant gains " in april , with the average house worth 15.1 % more than it was one year earlier .
but the halifax reiterated its earlier prediction that job losses and lower income growth will cool demand for property , leading to more moderate price increases later this year .
" our economic assessment is that house price inflation will ease over the course of this year as weaker income growth and higher unemployment reduces consumer confidence , " said halifax head of group economics gary styles .
price discrepancy halifax 's estimate of april price growth , at 0.7 % , is significantly below the record 3.4 % increase reported earlier this week by rival mortgage lender nationwide .
but the april growth figure tops halifax 's 0.4 % estimate for march .
average uk house prices have soared over in recent months , fuelled by low borrowing costs , high levels of employment , and a shortage of properties in key areas .
analysts say the sustained strength of the uk property market , seen as a evidence of inflationary pressures , makes it more likely that the bank of england will raise interest rates later this year .
the bank cut rates to their current 37-year low of 4 % last year in an attempt to stave off recession , but is widely forecast to raise the cost of borrowing in the second half of 2002 .
squeezed the average uk house now costs Â£ 102,851 , making it difficult for many first-time buyers to purchase property , the halifax said .
" we expect that an easing in house price inflation in 2002 , particularly in london , will provide some welcome help for this important buyer group , " mr styles said .
the halifax 's forecast that price growth will moderate tallies with other mortgage lenders ' predictions of a soft landing for the property market .
the major banks and building societies agree that an early 1990s-style house price crash , leaving homeowners burdened with mortgages worth more than their houses , is unlikely .

in its closely-watched monthly house price survey , the country 's biggest mortgage lender said uk property prices posted " further significant gains " in april , with the average house worth 15.1 % more than it was one year earlier .
but the halifax reiterated its earlier prediction that job losses and lower income growth will cool demand for property , leading to more moderate price increases later this year .
" our economic assessment is that house price inflation will ease over the course of this year as weaker income growth and higher unemployment reduces consumer confidence , " said halifax head of group economics gary styles .
price discrepancy halifax 's estimate of april price growth , at 0.7 % , is significantly below the record 3.4 % increase reported earlier this week by rival mortgage lender nationwide .
but the april growth figure tops halifax 's 0.4 % estimate for march .
average uk house prices have soared over in recent months , fuelled by low borrowing costs , high levels of employment , and a shortage of properties in key areas .
analysts say the sustained strength of the uk property market , seen as a evidence of inflationary pressures , makes it more likely that the bank of england will raise interest rates later this year .
the bank cut rates to their current 37-year low of 4 % last year in an attempt to stave off recession , but is widely forecast to raise the cost of borrowing in the second half of 2002 .
squeezed the average uk house now costs Â£ 102,851 , making it difficult for many first-time buyers to purchase property , the halifax said .
" we expect that an easing in house price inflation in 2002 , particularly in london , will provide some welcome help for this important buyer group , " mr styles said .
the halifax 's forecast that price growth will moderate tallies with other mortgage lenders ' predictions of a soft landing for the property market .
the major banks and building societies agree that an early 1990s-style house price crash , leaving homeowners burdened with mortgages worth more than their houses , is unlikely .

the trades union congress -lrb- tuc -rrb- wants three extra days a year to help workers become more productive .
uk workers have the lowest number of bank holidays and the least statutory leave in europe .
uk workers have the shortest holidays and lowest productivity in northern europe john monks , tuc general secretary however , the department of trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- said there are no plans to increase the number of public holidays .
there are eight bank holidays in britain , compared with 12 in italy , 13 in austria and up to 14 in spain and portugal .
tuc general secretary john monks said : " workers in this country have no statutory rights to bank holidays , having to rely instead on the generosity of their employers .
golden jubilee " uk workers have the shortest holidays and lowest productivity in northern europe .
" so offering more holidays makes sense for employers too because well rested workers are more productive .
bank holidays uk - eight italy - 12 austria - 13 spain and portugal - 14 " workers need proper time off work as much as their european colleagues , but once again they are at the bottom of the eu pile . "
the tuc has made regular demands for better public holiday entitlement .
a dti spokesman said : " the government is committed to promoting an effective work-life balance and we have made positive steps in this area , such as with the introduction of the working time and parental leave regulations . "
the dti pointed out there would be an extra day off in early june to mark the queen 's golden jubilee .

" i 'm absolutely delighted because i thought it was going to be a low poll , i thought people were really not going to bother , " said dr taylor .
" but out of eight candidates , to get seven of them is brilliant . "
the postal voting experiment in stevenage , hertfordshire , was a success with 52.9 % of the electorate taking up their democratic right , compared with a figure of 29 % for the town in 2000 .

bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- has labour kept its promises ?

labour has met nearly 80 % of its 1997 election pledges , according to a major research project carried out by the bbc .
we have made it our guiding rule not to promise what we can not deliver 1997 labour manifesto the research - commissioned to mark the fifth anniversary of tony blair 's election victory - shows that 48 out of 229 manifesto promises are either too difficult to judge or have not been met .
the findings will be seized on by ministers as a sign that labour is fulfilling its contract with the british people .
but critics are likely to point out that in several crucial areas - such as waiting times for cancer treatment , crime and electoral reform - labour has failed to deliver .
' unacceptable ' conservative leader iain duncan smith used labour 's fifth anniversary to launch an attack on mr blair 's record on crime and transport .
mr duncan smith mocked deputy prime minister john prescott 's 1997 promise that there would be " far fewer " cars on the road within five years .
" in this government no one takes responsibility , no one apologises and no one resigns , " mr duncan smith told mps during prime minister 's questions on wednesday .
in response mr blair said road traffic had increased , partly because of britain 's economic growth .
and he reeled off a list of labour successes , such as the minimum wage , record primary school results and low unemployment , which had been achieved in the five years in power .
mixed sex wards however , there are a number of specific promises mr blair has failed to deliver on , the bbc 's research has shown .
he has failed to call a referendum on proportional representation .
and his manifesto pledge to " tackle the unacceptable levels of anti-social behaviour and crime on our streets " will have a particularly hollow ring five years on in the inner cities , where street crime is soaring .
labour 's commitment to phasing out mixed sex wards in hospitals and to strengthening the role of local health authorities , making them " the guardians of high standards " , are also among the 21 pledges that have gone unfulfilled .
benchmark in carrying out the survey , the bbc 's analysis and research department identified 229 manifesto commitments in the 1997 labour manifesto and researched each one to find out whether it has been carried out .
labour 's pledges done 181 -lrb- 79 % -rrb- not done 21 -lrb- 9.2 % -rrb- on course 3 -lrb- 1.3 % -rrb- partially done 14 -lrb- 6.1 % -rrb- debatable 10 -lrb- 4.4 % -rrb- the idea was to make an objective analysis of labour 's record over five years , using the terms of its own " contract with the people " as a benchmark .
no judgements were made on the quality of what the government has delivered - or the value of individual pledges .
pledges where some government activity has been observed - such as house of lords reform - have been marked " partially done " .
others , where no objective measure of the government 's response can be made - such as " making prime minister 's time more effective " - have been marked " debatable " .
' debatable ' pledges that could be fulfilled in the next few months - such as the partial privatisation of the london underground - have been judged " on course " .
the government has been judged by the letter rather than spirit of its commitments - but comments have been offered where there is room for debate .
cornerstone new labour has made use of pledges like no other party , setting specific targets for everything from class sizes to court waiting times .
in its 1997 manifesto , the party said " we have made it our guiding rule not to promise what we can not deliver ; and to deliver what we promise . "
its five key election pledges - printed on its famous pledge cards - were a cornerstone of its 1997 campaign .
the five pledges - on youth unemployment , primary school class sizes , economic stability , nhs waiting lists and waiting times for young offenders - have all now been met .
some way off but the bbc 's research has also thrown up a number of areas where labour has barely scratched the surface .
perennial problems such as crime and health have proved particularly difficult to crack .
and small businesses might not think the 1997 promise to " cut red tape " had been achieved , following chancellor gordon brown 's decision to administer tax credits for the poor through company payrolls .
labour 's pledge to simplify the planning process is also some way off .
quietly dropped the government has also failed to carry out a raft of modish promises on the " new economy " .
its promise to " wire up schools , libraries , colleges and hospitals to the information superhighway " and to " make access charges as low as possible " remain on the still-to-do list .
as does its promise to provide " every child with an e-mail address " .
other specific promises - such as the creation of a new qualification for school headmasters and replace the youth training scheme with a new " target 2000 " scheme - appear to have been quietly dropped .

nine councils are now under the control of a different party , after a night that saw four tory gains , four losses for labour and one gain for the liberal democrats .
outside london , labour regained control of oxford city council while elmbridge in surrey became only the second authority in england to be controlled by independents .
labour shock in a shock result for labour , lambeth is now a hung council with labour losing seats to the liberal democrats .
labour also lost control of waltham forest in north-east london which has become a hung council and the party suffered a defeat in harrow , where it remains the largest party but without a majority .
labur gained bexley which had been a hung council and held on to hackney , where there was only postal voting , and to newham which abolished the ballot box in favour of computers .
the liberal democrats gained one of their targets , kingston-upon-thames which had been a hung council by taking seven seats from labour . "
it makes you wonder how many other people might be wrongly turned away when they have turned up to vote .
this is all the more serious when voter turnout is already so low " simon hughes mp the lib dems held on to sutton but failed to gain southwark where they had been targeting labour seats and where the council is still hung .
southwark includes peckham where crime has been a big local issue following the death of damilola taylor .
but a mix-up over postal ballots in southwark meant that even the local mp simon hughes was prevented from voting in his own constituency .
" it makes you wonder how many other people might be wrongly turned away when they have turned up to vote .
" it must be a priority for all citizens who want to vote to be able to do so .
" every person wrongly stopped from voting is a democratic injustice .

they recaptured enfield from labour , the scene of michael portillo 's humiliation in the 1997 general election .
in addition they gained richmond-upon-thames from the lib dems and gained control of barnet and redbridge , both of which had been hung councils . "

steve norris , the conservative candidate for london mayor said it was the night the tories had done reasonably well in the capital .
" i think we won in all the seats where the liberals failed to put candidates up .
" we are now head to head with labour in the popular vote in london about 35 % to 35 % .
" that 's a terrific advance for us but a lot more to do . "
residents in hackney , in east london , voted in favour of electing a mayor .
just over 70 % of voters backed the move in a referendum to have a directly-elected first citizen .
turnout low and two new labour mayors were elected in newham and lewisham - although it took a second count to confirm steve bullock in lewisham and sir robin wales only just got through in the first round in newham .
turnout in greater london was around 30 % on average compared with 35 % in the country as a whole , despite various experiments with new ways of voting .
minister for london nick raynsford said : " but we must remember that london had a higher turnout that the rest of the country four years ago .
" the rest of the country has improved .
london has n't .
" i am pleased the pilots where we 've tried to encourage new ways of voting , including all postal ballots , do appear to have been very successful and the turnout in some places has almost doubled compared to four years ago . "
outside greater london , in tunbridge wells , kent , the conservatives retained control of the borough council with an increased majority , but labour lost its leader .
maidstone remains a hung council and in swale the conservatives won an overall majority as the liberal democrats lost seats .

independent gain in oxford , labour regained control of the council once more .
the city also voted against having an elected mayor .
meanwhile there were no surprises in either cherwell or west oxfordshire where the conservatives strengthened their control of the district councils .
the only change to come out of the local elections in surrey , was the victory of the residents in elmbridge .
the independents , who were already the largest group on the council , now have control of the authority .
it becomes only the second borough in the country to be controlled by a group of independents .
