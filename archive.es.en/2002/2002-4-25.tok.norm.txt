but the cardinals , who were summoned to the vatican by the pope , appeared to stop short of announcing a policy of " zero tolerance " towards abusers .
they said in a statement that a final decision would be taken at the next conference in dallas , texas , in june as it was not within the competence of wednesday 's meeting .
it said the church was anxious to move expeditiously but correctly , with a procedure that was clear , specific and airtight .
but the cardinals also released a message to all us priests pledging to support them through " these troubled times " .
" we know the heavy burden of sorrow and shame that you are bearing because some have betrayed the grace of ordination by abusing those entrusted to their care , " the letter said .
the news came at the end of a two-day crisis meeting in response to the rash of paedophilia cover-up scandals that have rocked the church in the us and several other countries .
pope 's condemnation concern about the children affected , the cardinals said , had broken the pope 's heart , and the most important thing was the need to be sure children were not being hurt . "

it mentioned a special process to remove priests who were serial predatory sex abusers , suggesting there was still disagreement over how to deal with first-time offenders .
the meeting also failed to address the future of boston cardinal bernard law , who is facing resignation calls over allegations of cover-ups of sex abuse cases .
cardinal law was absent from a news conference announcing the statement , citing " prior engagements " .
the meeting follows the pope 's strongest ever condemnation of child abuse in a statement on tuesday .
" people need to know that there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young , " the pontiff said .
the roman catholic church in the us has been criticised for transferring priests known to have molested children instead of suspending them and telling the police .
the pope summoned the cardinals for two days of closed-door talks after it became clear that the church was being damaged by the scandals .
resignation pressure more than 400 complaints have been lodged against priests in the boston diocese alone .
accusations of child molestation have also been made in at least 16 other us dioceses including chicago , new york , philadelphia and san francisco .
the scandals are a huge financial burden for the church and there is talk that some archdioceses will be bankrupted as a result .
although the us church is the hardest hit by sex abuse allegations , similar scandals have hit clergy in different countries in recent years , including austria , ireland , poland , france and mexico .

options for a £ 3.5bn rail safety system recommended after the 1999 paddington crash , are being unveiled on thursday .
computers would be used to control train speeds under the european rail traffic management system -lrb- ermts -rrb- reducing the chance of human error .
the installation is eagerly awaited by the families of victims of the paddington crash and it would bring the uk rail network up to date with european safety rules . "
what is the point of having a public inquiry if its recommendations are then ignored by the railway industry ? "
maureen kavanagh victim 's mother but thursday 's report is expected to argue more time is needed so an advanced version of the technology can be fitted .
and the government 's own advisers , the commission for integrated transport , said earlier this week the system will reduce rail capacity while it is being set up .
this would force more people into cars and bring about more deaths on the roads , the commission said .
an official public inquiry report last year recommended ertms should be introduced on all uk 100mph lines by 2010 .
the options being outlined on thursday by the strategic rail authority and the railway safety group include which type of system to install and how long to take trains out of action to do it .
the report will now go to the health and safety executive for three months of consultation .
signals at danger the 2010 deadline for ertms was set in a joint report by lord cullen , who chaired the inquiry into the paddington crash , which claimed 31 lives , and professor john uff , who chaired the inquiry into the september 1997 southall crash , in which seven people died .
both disasters were caused by trains going through signals at red .
maureen kavanagh , whose son died in the southall crash and who is chairman of the safety on trains action group , fears the 2010 timetable will not be met .
she said : " what is the point of having a public inquiry if its recommendations are then ignored by the railway industry ? "
raising standards simon benham , chairman of the paddington survivors group , said : " we are looking to the government to implement the uff - cullen report .
if it is not implemented , we shall be disappointed . "
professor andrew evans , professor of transport safety at university college london , says the more simple train protection warning system -lrb- tpws -rrb- being installed by the end of next year could adequately prevent accidents such as paddington .
he said : " at billions of pounds , installing ertms after tpws for safety reasons alone would be an unjustified use of public money .
" it is better to think of ertms not primarily as a safety measure but as a new signalling technology which will increase capacity and reduce infrastructure costs .
" therefore , the timescale for installing it and the technology to be used should be driven primarily by the social and commercial benefits . "

the stumbling block is spanish reluctance to accept the principal that any deal reached must be acceptable to the gibraltarians .
britain has pledged to hold a referendum on any sovereignty changes .
no agreement is better than a bad agreement foreign office source foreign secretary jack straw discussed the disputed colony with his spanish counterpart josep pique in a meeting at the european union gathering in valencia on tuesday .
in a written parliamentary answer published on wednesday , foreign office minister peter hain said it remained the government 's ambition to reach a deal with the spanish by the summer - " if possible " .
mr hain said : " our objectives remain to preserve gibraltar 's way of life , establish greater self-government , deliver lasting practical benefits and a stronger economy , and secure a lasting agreement on sovereignty so that gibraltarians can enjoy security for their way of life . "
agreement had been expected to be agreed by the summer but this no longer seems a done deal .
opposition a foreign office official said : " we are making progress , but it is real negotiation .
it is difficult and it is not a foregone conclusion that we will reach an agreement .
" it is kind of make your mind up time now for the spanish .
" no agreement is better than a bad agreement and they are not going to apologise for defending gibraltar 's interests or our interests . "
gibraltarians have so far voiced loud opposition to any change in their status , making their feelings know with mass demonstrations .
spain has been trying to get the rock back ever since it ceded gibraltar to britain nearly three hundred years ago .
it is unlikely to give up its claim , so a deal will have to be crafted which allows spain to keep face .

the stumbling block is spanish reluctance to accept the principal that any deal reached must be acceptable to the gibraltarians .
britain has pledged to hold a referendum on any sovereignty changes . "
no agreement is better than a bad agreement " foreign office source foreign secretary jack straw discussed the disputed colony with his spanish counterpart josep pique in a meeting at the european union gathering in valencia on tuesday .
in a written parliamentary answer published on wednesday , foreign office minister peter hain said it remained the government 's ambition to reach a deal with the spanish by the summer - " if possible " .
mr hain said : " our objectives remain to preserve gibraltar 's way of life , establish greater self-government , deliver lasting practical benefits and a stronger economy , and secure a lasting agreement on sovereignty so that gibraltarians can enjoy security for their way of life . "
agreement had been expected to be agreed by the summer but this no longer seems a done deal .
opposition a foreign office official said : " we are making progress , but it is real negotiation .
it is difficult and it is not a foregone conclusion that we will reach an agreement .
" it is kind of make your mind up time now for the spanish .
" no agreement is better than a bad agreement and they are not going to apologise for defending gibraltar 's interests or our interests . "
gibraltarians have so far voiced loud opposition to any change in their status , making their feelings know with mass demonstrations .
spain has been trying to get the rock back ever since it ceded gibraltar to britain nearly three hundred years ago .
it is unlikely to give up its claim , so a deal will have to be crafted which allows spain to keep face .
a foreign office spokesman said the government was working to ensure that the deal their reached was " durable " .
the conservatives have accused the government of conducting the negotiations in secret .

the cost of sick leave rose by just over £ 1bn in 2001 , even though the number of sick days was the lowest since the employer 's organisation began keeping records in 1987 .
workers took a total of 176 million days off for illness , which is 16 million fewer days than in 2000 .
but employers paid out more to cover for absent staff .
sick leave cost uk businesses £ 11.8bn in 2001 compared to £ 10.7bn the previous year .
extra spending " concerns about job security and better absence management led to a fall in days lost , but firms say costs increased , " said susan anderson , cbi director of human resources policy .
" firms are under greater competitive pressures and , with less slack in their operations , providing cover is likely to mean extra spending on overtime or temps . "
the average british worker had seven days off work last year , according to a cbi survey of 668 firms .
absenteeism rates have fallen steadily since the early 1990s , shrinking by two days a year every year for the last decade .
public sector workers took the most days off sick - 10 - while manual workers took an average of nine days last year , compared to five and a half for white collar staff .
employers believed most absence was for genuine reasons such as sickness , although some workers took time off because of family responsibilities , the cbi said .
