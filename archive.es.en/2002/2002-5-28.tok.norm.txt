the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .
" the long-lasting breakthrough in the relations between the two countries has already been achieved .
the present level of cultural and trade exchange is on a level that is without precedence in the history of the two nations " , he says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fifa world cup 2002 with information on south korea and japan and a overview of football in asia 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .
" the long-lasting breakthrough in the relations between the two countries has already been achieved .
the present level of cultural and trade exchange is on a level that is without precedence in the history of the two nations " , he says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fifa world cup 2002 with information on south korea and japan and a overview of football in asia 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

following the scares around bse and foot-and-mouth disease , germany 's food sector has been hit by yet another scandal .
chicken feed containing a dangerous pesticide has found its way into over 100 organic farms . for many german consumers , organic products were the only safe option in times of mad cow and foot-and-mouth disease .

following the scares around bse and foot-and-mouth disease , germany 's food sector has been hit by yet another scandal .
chicken feed containing a dangerous pesticide has found its way into over 100 organic farms . for many german consumers , organic products were the only safe option in times of mad cow and foot-and-mouth disease .
people felt reassured that " bio " food was thoroughly controlled and could be eaten without any qualms .
but a new scandal has hit precisely this sector .
the pesticide nitrofen has been discovered in over 100 tons of wheat delivered over the past year to organic farms .
the cancer-causing agent was fed to chickens at more than 100 " bio " farms in northern germany .
in numerous states , authorities have begun recalling poultry products and eggs .
are other european countries affected ?
the nitrofen scandal could take on larger dimensions than initially thought .
according to renate künast , federal minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , it still is n't clear whether only organic wheat is affected .

" right now , we ca n't say how the nitrofen got into the feed , " said künast -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if these were exports from eastern europe , then other eu countries will also have to ask themselves what we are actually facing . "
she said the use of nitrofen is still allowed in several eastern european countries , but did n't name them .
germany banned the pesticide in 1988 .
eastern europe exports several million tons of wheat annually to eu nations .

"
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .
we 're integrating with russia , the middle east and africa .
it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "
" it wo n't be a european type of multilateral approach because the u.s. and russia look at the world different than we do , " he adds , " but i 'm optimistic that it will be multilateral .

"
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .

it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .
" the long-lasting breakthrough in the relations between the two countries has already been achieved .
the present level of cultural and trade exchange is on a level that is without precedence in the history of the two nations " , he says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fifa world cup 2002 with information on south korea and japan and a overview of football in asia 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .

"
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .
we 're integrating with russia , the middle east and africa .
it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "
" it wo n't be a european type of multilateral approach because the u.s. and russia look at the world different than we do , " he adds , " but i 'm optimistic that it will be multilateral .

"
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .

following the scares around bse and foot-and-mouth disease , germany 's food sector has been hit by yet another scandal .
chicken feed containing a dangerous pesticide has found its way into over 100 organic farms . for many german consumers , organic products were the only safe option in times of mad cow and foot-and-mouth disease .
people felt reassured that " bio " food was thoroughly controlled and could be eaten without any qualms .
but a new scandal has hit precisely this sector .
the pesticide nitrofen has been discovered in over 100 tons of wheat delivered over the past year to organic farms .
the cancer-causing agent was fed to chickens at more than 100 " bio " farms in northern germany .
in numerous states , authorities have begun recalling poultry products and eggs .
are other european countries affected ?
the nitrofen scandal could take on larger dimensions than initially thought .
according to renate künast , federal minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , it still is n't clear whether only organic wheat is affected .

" right now , we ca n't say how the nitrofen got into the feed , " said künast -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if these were exports from eastern europe , then other eu countries will also have to ask themselves what we are actually facing . "
she said the use of nitrofen is still allowed in several eastern european countries , but did n't name them .
germany banned the pesticide in 1988 .
eastern europe exports several million tons of wheat annually to eu nations .
but the precise origin of the scandalous wheat has not yet been determined .
hiding the truth it has also materialized that meat inspectors knew months ago that batches of poultry were contaminated with nitrofen .
künast stressed that this would " have consequences " .
there are reports of financial sanctions for private laboratories who were already aware of the problem .
the opposition christian democrats have sharply criticized künast , a member of the green party .
she has strongly promoted organic farming since scares such as bse hit the food sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world news -pipe- 28.05.2002 europeans give bush visit mixed marks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the protests and criticism , george w. bush says the u.s. and europe are " good friends . "
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .
we 're integrating with russia , the middle east and africa .
it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "
" it wo n't be a european type of multilateral approach because the u.s. and russia look at the world different than we do , " he adds , " but i 'm optimistic that it will be multilateral .

"
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .

it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .
" the long-lasting breakthrough in the relations between the two countries has already been achieved .
the present level of cultural and trade exchange is on a level that is without precedence in the history of the two nations " , he says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fifa world cup 2002 with information on south korea and japan and a overview of football in asia 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .
" the long-lasting breakthrough in the relations between the two countries has already been achieved .
the present level of cultural and trade exchange is on a level that is without precedence in the history of the two nations " , he says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fifa world cup 2002 with information on south korea and japan and a overview of football in asia 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .
we 're integrating with russia , the middle east and africa .
it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "
" it wo n't be a european type of multilateral approach because the u.s. and russia look at the world different than we do , " he adds , " but i 'm optimistic that it will be multilateral .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world news -pipe- 28.05.2002 europeans give bush visit mixed marks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the protests and criticism , george w. bush says the u.s. and europe are " good friends . "
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .
we 're integrating with russia , the middle east and africa .
it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "
" it wo n't be a european type of multilateral approach because the u.s. and russia look at the world different than we do , " he adds , " but i 'm optimistic that it will be multilateral .

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .
" the long-lasting breakthrough in the relations between the two countries has already been achieved .
the present level of cultural and trade exchange is on a level that is without precedence in the history of the two nations " , he says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fifa world cup 2002 with information on south korea and japan and a overview of football in asia 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .
" the long-lasting breakthrough in the relations between the two countries has already been achieved .
the present level of cultural and trade exchange is on a level that is without precedence in the history of the two nations " , he says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fifa world cup 2002 with information on south korea and japan and a overview of football in asia 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .
" the long-lasting breakthrough in the relations between the two countries has already been achieved .
the present level of cultural and trade exchange is on a level that is without precedence in the history of the two nations " , he says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fifa world cup 2002 with information on south korea and japan and a overview of football in asia 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .
we 're integrating with russia , the middle east and africa .
it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "

" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .
we 're integrating with russia , the middle east and africa .
it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "

following the scares around bse and foot-and-mouth disease , germany 's food sector has been hit by yet another scandal .
chicken feed containing a dangerous pesticide has found its way into over 100 organic farms . for many german consumers , organic products were the only safe option in times of mad cow and foot-and-mouth disease .
people felt reassured that " bio " food was thoroughly controlled and could be eaten without any qualms .
but a new scandal has hit precisely this sector .
the pesticide nitrofen has been discovered in over 100 tons of wheat delivered over the past year to organic farms .
the cancer-causing agent was fed to chickens at more than 100 " bio " farms in northern germany .
in numerous states , authorities have begun recalling poultry products and eggs .
are other european countries affected ?
the nitrofen scandal could take on larger dimensions than initially thought .
according to renate künast , federal minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , it still is n't clear whether only organic wheat is affected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german agriculture minister renate künast .
" right now , we ca n't say how the nitrofen got into the feed , " said künast -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if these were exports from eastern europe , then other eu countries will also have to ask themselves what we are actually facing . "
she said the use of nitrofen is still allowed in several eastern european countries , but did n't name them .
germany banned the pesticide in 1988 .
eastern europe exports several million tons of wheat annually to eu nations .
but the precise origin of the scandalous wheat has not yet been determined .
hiding the truth it has also materialized that meat inspectors knew months ago that batches of poultry were contaminated with nitrofen .
künast stressed that this would " have consequences " .
there are reports of financial sanctions for private laboratories who were already aware of the problem .
the opposition christian democrats have sharply criticized künast , a member of the green party .
she has strongly promoted organic farming since scares such as bse hit the food sector .
but critical voices have also surfaced from the green coalition partner , the social democrats .

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .
" the long-lasting breakthrough in the relations between the two countries has already been achieved .
the present level of cultural and trade exchange is on a level that is without precedence in the history of the two nations " , he says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fifa world cup 2002 with information on south korea and japan and a overview of football in asia 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .

japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .
" the long-lasting breakthrough in the relations between the two countries has already been achieved .
the present level of cultural and trade exchange is on a level that is without precedence in the history of the two nations " , he says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fifa world cup 2002 with information on south korea and japan and a overview of football in asia 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .

following the scares around bse and foot-and-mouth disease , germany 's food sector has been hit by yet another scandal .
chicken feed containing a dangerous pesticide has found its way into over 100 organic farms . for many german consumers , organic products were the only safe option in times of mad cow and foot-and-mouth disease .
people felt reassured that " bio " food was thoroughly controlled and could be eaten without any qualms .
but a new scandal has hit precisely this sector .
the pesticide nitrofen has been discovered in over 100 tons of wheat delivered over the past year to organic farms .
the cancer-causing agent was fed to chickens at more than 100 " bio " farms in northern germany .
in numerous states , authorities have begun recalling poultry products and eggs .

the nitrofen scandal could take on larger dimensions than initially thought .
according to renate künast , federal minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , it still is n't clear whether only organic wheat is affected .

" if these were exports from eastern europe , then other eu countries will also have to ask themselves what we are actually facing . "
she said the use of nitrofen is still allowed in several eastern european countries , but did n't name them .
germany banned the pesticide in 1988 .
eastern europe exports several million tons of wheat annually to eu nations .
but the precise origin of the scandalous wheat has not yet been determined .

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .

but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .

korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .

observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .

"
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .
we 're integrating with russia , the middle east and africa .
it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "
" it wo n't be a european type of multilateral approach because the u.s. and russia look at the world different than we do , " he adds , " but i 'm optimistic that it will be multilateral .

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .

following the scares around bse and foot-and-mouth disease , germany 's food sector has been hit by yet another scandal .
chicken feed containing a dangerous pesticide has found its way into over 100 organic farms . for many german consumers , organic products were the only safe option in times of mad cow and foot-and-mouth disease .

the nitrofen scandal could take on larger dimensions than initially thought .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world news -pipe- 28.05.2002 europeans give bush visit mixed marks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the protests and criticism , george w. bush says the u.s. and europe are " good friends . "
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .
we 're integrating with russia , the middle east and africa .
it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "
" it wo n't be a european type of multilateral approach because the u.s. and russia look at the world different than we do , " he adds , " but i 'm optimistic that it will be multilateral .

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .

following the scares around bse and foot-and-mouth disease , germany 's food sector has been hit by yet another scandal .
chicken feed containing a dangerous pesticide has found its way into over 100 organic farms . for many german consumers , organic products were the only safe option in times of mad cow and foot-and-mouth disease .
people felt reassured that " bio " food was thoroughly controlled and could be eaten without any qualms .
but a new scandal has hit precisely this sector .
the pesticide nitrofen has been discovered in over 100 tons of wheat delivered over the past year to organic farms .
the cancer-causing agent was fed to chickens at more than 100 " bio " farms in northern germany .
in numerous states , authorities have begun recalling poultry products and eggs .
are other european countries affected ?
the nitrofen scandal could take on larger dimensions than initially thought .
according to renate künast , federal minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , it still is n't clear whether only organic wheat is affected .

" right now , we ca n't say how the nitrofen got into the feed , " said künast -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if these were exports from eastern europe , then other eu countries will also have to ask themselves what we are actually facing . "
she said the use of nitrofen is still allowed in several eastern european countries , but did n't name them .
germany banned the pesticide in 1988 .
eastern europe exports several million tons of wheat annually to eu nations .
but the precise origin of the scandalous wheat has not yet been determined .
hiding the truth it has also materialized that meat inspectors knew months ago that batches of poultry were contaminated with nitrofen .
künast stressed that this would " have consequences " .
there are reports of financial sanctions for private laboratories who were already aware of the problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world news -pipe- 28.05.2002 europeans give bush visit mixed marks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the protests and criticism , george w. bush says the u.s. and europe are " good friends . "
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .
we 're integrating with russia , the middle east and africa .
it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "
" it wo n't be a european type of multilateral approach because the u.s. and russia look at the world different than we do , " he adds , " but i 'm optimistic that it will be multilateral .

observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .
" the long-lasting breakthrough in the relations between the two countries has already been achieved .
the present level of cultural and trade exchange is on a level that is without precedence in the history of the two nations " , he says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fifa world cup 2002 with information on south korea and japan and a overview of football in asia radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .
we 're integrating with russia , the middle east and africa .
it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "

"
from berlin to rome , u.s. president george w. bush has sought to underscore the strength and importance of transatlantic ties .
but foreign policy experts fail to agree over whether his visit has been a success . during the first eight months of his presidency , much of europe saw in bush a swaggering , gun-slinging , lone ranger figure whose imagination did n't seem to stretch beyond a certain ranch in crawford , texas .
then he proceeded to back out of treaty after treaty - from kyoto to the international court to the anti-ballistic missile pact .
the latter raised eyebrows in germany , a country that had been literally divided by the cold war , and elsewhere in europe , fueling fears that the move could provoke russia into a new arms race .
instead , in the intervening months , bush sought to bring russia closer to the u.s. and europe .
and in speech after speech during the past five days in europe , bush has sought to allay fears that the u.s. is seeking to go its own way in the world or that a values gap is expanding between the continents .
" there 's a heck of a lot more that unites us than divides us , " he said on sunday in france .
" we share the same values , we trade $ 2 trillion -lrb- 2.173 trillion euro -rrb- a year .
i mean , i do n't view hostility here . "
paving the way for better ties bernhard may , deputy director of the german council for foreign relations in berlin , says the visit has already paved the way for improved transatlantic relations .
" the most important point is that he assured europeans that he will not implement unilateral foreign policy , " may says .
" there are other problems in the relationship , like trade and environmental disputes , but nobody expected him to come with solutions for those . "
he says the groundwork bush laid here could help generate support for military intervention in iraq if diplomatic efforts to get un weapons inspectors back into the country fail .
" some europeans , including german politicians were not yet willing to face the challenge of how to deal with saddam hussein .
now many are saying that the first step is to put more pressure on him to allow weapons inspectors in , " he says .
" but if that fails , politicians are now coming around to the idea of using military means . "
ending the cold war may also speaks favorably of the u.s. 's redefined relationship with russia , which he says will have positive repercussions for europe .
" now , the u.s. , russia and europe are working together on the most difficult security issues .
in addition , the enlargement of the european union and accepting new members into nato is part of a policy to get rid of the cold war structure in europe .
that is good news for everyone from portugal to siberia , " he says .
another political analyst casts a more jaundiced eye in his dissection of bush 's trip , pointing to what he sees as a growing gulf between european and american values .
" the philosophical divide between bush and the u.s. and the european union is quite fundamental .
it really is a question of unilateralism vs. multilateralism , " asserts michael emerson , a senior researcher at the center for european policy studies in brussels .
europe : the new melting pot " europe is now looking at its eastern periphery and its relationship with russia as integrating europe , " he says . " the u.s. is not integrating with anybody , but we are .
we 're integrating with russia , the middle east and africa .
it 's a different type of world that europeans are looking at , and we feel we need to work it out progressively , integrating concepts and mechanisms . "
it 's a view of europe that encompasses a melting pot of beliefs and cultures , from christianity to islam .
emerson does n't mince his words in his acerbic assessment of u.s. foreign policy : " the u.s. approach is to be as far away as possible and , when they see an enemy , to strike as hard as possible .
otherwise , they prefer to just stay home . "
he sees little significance or change as a result of the visit .
he describes the disarmament treaty with moscow as a " vestige , a left over from the cold war . "
may , on the other hand , believes the deal signed in rome to make russia a junior nato partner represents a tremendous expansion of the transatlatic relationship .
he feels the deal struck with the russians , along with his feather-smoothing visit to europe shows that bush has quickly learned one of the painful lessons that faces every first-term administration .
" it has been a painful process for bush that was greatly accelerated after september 11 , " may says , " but he has learned that if you 're the only superpower in the world , you ca n't protect your own people across the globe by going unilateral . "
" it wo n't be a european type of multilateral approach because the u.s. and russia look at the world different than we do , " he adds , " but i 'm optimistic that it will be multilateral .

the world cup , which kicks off on friday , is being viewed as an impetus for host countries japan and south korea to paper over a century of animosity .
but can the sport really reconciliate the two nations ? the upcoming soccer world cup on friday might be the world ’ s largest sporting event , eagerly awaited by millions of soccer fans around the world .
the month-long tournament will bring millions of dollars in revenues to host countries japan and south korea , providing a much-needed pickup for their slumping economies .
observers are also hoping it will bring relief on another level and ease decades-old tensions between former enemies .
ever since the momentous decision was taken in 1996 to award the world cup to both japan and south korea , the two rancorous south east asian neighbours have toned down their often heated rhetoric and diplomatic spats and focussed their energies on pulling off the gigantic sporting event .
relations between the two nations soured when japan annexed korea in 1910 and brutally ruled it till the end of wwii .
japan ’ s military excesses and flouting of human rights during its occupation of korea has left a painful legacy among generations of south koreans , who have never quite forgiven its larger neighbour .
football - paving the path to reconciliation ?
but several political analysts believe that co-hosting the football world cup has accelerated a recent thawing of frosty relations between south korea and japan , precipitated by japan ’ s official apology for its colonial past in 1998 .
senior research fellow at the institute for asian studies -lrb- ifa -rrb- in hamburg , dr dirk nabers told dw-world that the world cup has " definitely had a great impact " on relations between the two countries .
" in the last five years tourist exchange between the two countries has been greatly facilitated , more flights operate between the two countries and it ’ s become easier for south koreans to enter japan – with visas for short-term korean visitors being done away with " , he said .
liberalisation of cultural exchange but the biggest change , according to dr nabers , has been in the intensified cultural trade and exchange between the two countries .
korea has suddenly become cool in japan , with young japanese lapping up korean pop music and food and crowding to watch the latest korean movies .
for its part , the government of south korean president kim dae jung has become more permissive to japanese culture , which was strictly banned until 1998 .
even japanese emperor akihito , created a stir last december when he admitted on his 68th birthday that japan ’ s imperial family was descended from the kingdom of paeckche , an ancient korean civilisation .
difficult to face painful past but despite these seeming leaps and bounds in improving relations between the two nations , the brotherly spirit of the soccer tournament will not be able to heal all wounds .
dr. nabers says that there are " emotional problems between the two sides as far as collaboration on historical events and interpretation goes " .
less than a year ago , seoul and tokyo were at loggerheads over a series of disputes linked to japan ’ s wartime colonisation .
the two clashed over a japanese school textbook seen as whitewashing the country ’ s wartime actions .
japanese prime minister koizumi ’ s visit to tokyo ’ s controversial yasukuni shrine last month , which includes 14 convicted war criminals among its honoured spirits also led to an outcry in korea .
and japanese emperor akihito will be skipping the opening ceremony of the world cup in seoul .
it 's a decision that nabers believes is probably for the best .
" emperor akihito , from the perspective of south koreans , is a class a war criminal par excellence – he exemplifies colonial rule in south korea and remains the most hated person there , " nabers said .
" a hatred that ’ s transferred from generation to generation . "
all is not lost but despite the bad blood still flowing between the two neighbours , nabers is confident that the " future is bright for the two countries " and that the present show of harmony between the two will not come to a abrupt halt after the world cup is over .
" the long-lasting breakthrough in the relations between the two countries has already been achieved .
the present level of cultural and trade exchange is on a level that is without precedence in the history of the two nations " , he says . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links fifa world cup 2002 with information on south korea and japan and a overview of football in asia radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

following the scares around bse and foot-and-mouth disease , germany 's food sector has been hit by yet another scandal .
chicken feed containing a dangerous pesticide has found its way into over 100 organic farms . for many german consumers , organic products were the only safe option in times of mad cow and foot-and-mouth disease .
people felt reassured that " bio " food was thoroughly controlled and could be eaten without any qualms .
but a new scandal has hit precisely this sector .
the pesticide nitrofen has been discovered in over 100 tons of wheat delivered over the past year to organic farms .
the cancer-causing agent was fed to chickens at more than 100 " bio " farms in northern germany .
in numerous states , authorities have begun recalling poultry products and eggs .
are other european countries affected ?
the nitrofen scandal could take on larger dimensions than initially thought .
according to renate künast , federal minister of consumer protection , food and agriculture , it still is n't clear whether only organic wheat is affected .

" right now , we ca n't say how the nitrofen got into the feed , " said künast -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" if these were exports from eastern europe , then other eu countries will also have to ask themselves what we are actually facing . "
she said the use of nitrofen is still allowed in several eastern european countries , but did n't name them .
germany banned the pesticide in 1988 .
eastern europe exports several million tons of wheat annually to eu nations .
but the precise origin of the scandalous wheat has not yet been determined .
hiding the truth it has also materialized that meat inspectors knew months ago that batches of poultry were contaminated with nitrofen .
künast stressed that this would " have consequences " .
there are reports of financial sanctions for private laboratories who were already aware of the problem .
the opposition christian democrats have sharply criticized künast , a member of the green party .
she has strongly promoted organic farming since scares such as bse hit the food sector .

a survey has shown that smoking and alcohol and marijuana use increased among residents of manhattan during the five to eight weeks after the terrorist attacks on the world trade center -lrb- wtc -rrb- . "
rates of psychological distress and increases in substance use were noticeable throughout new york city " dr david vlahov almost one-third of the nearly 1,000 people interviewed reported an increased use of alcohol , marijuana , or cigarettes .
the largest increase was in alcohol use .
about one in four of the respondents said they were drinking more alcohol in the weeks after 11 september .
one in ten reported an increase in smoking , and 3.2 % said they had increased their use of marijuana .
dr glen hanson , of the national institute on drug abuse -lrb- nida -rrb- , said : " this research will help us to design more effective substance abuse treatment and prevention strategies for individuals coping with severe stress . "
random calls the investigators contacted the survey participants by randomly dialling new york city phone numbers .
during the week prior to 11 september , 2001 , 22.6 % of the participants reported smoking cigarettes , 59.1 % drinking alcohol , and 4.4 % using marijuana .
after september 11th , 23.4 % reported smoking cigarettes , 64.4 % drinking alcohol and , 5.7 % smoking marijuana .
among those who smoked , almost 10 % reported smoking at least an extra pack of cigarettes a week and among those who drank alcohol , more than 20 % reported imbibing at least one extra drink a day .
the researchers , from the new york academy of medicine , found that people who reported an increase in substance abuse were more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- and from depression .
people who reported an increase in cigarette smoking or marijuana use were also more likely to have both ptsd and depression , while those who reported an increase in alcohol use were more likely to have depression only .
general effect researcher dr david vlahov told bbc news online : " the findings were more pronounced among those who lived in close proximity to the disaster .
" however , we found that rates of pyschological distress and increases in substance use were noticeable throughout new york city .
" while people may increase substance use as a way to try and cope with the effects and aftermath of the disaster , continued use may signal problems in coping .
" in particular , cigarette use is particularly addictive , and public health officials need to consider programmes to assist people with smoking cessation . "
the research is published in the american journal of epidemiology .

we have half a million traffic jams every year - that 's approaching 10,000 every week - and it is set to get worse .
how bad is your journey to work ?
what should be done to improve the ailing network ?
all the reporters and interviewees had the same basic assumption " people were going to travel more , further and faster " .
the " solutions " that were being promoted involved high technology or construction .
most of the interviewees were either drivers who wanted change but were not prepared to pay for it or promoters of change who stood to profit from it .
everyone enthusiastically overlooked one very simple fact " people do not travel more , they travel further " .
if you grasp this point then a whole lot of simple low tech and cheep solutions open up and most of them involve local authorities and planning permission .
but it wo n't happen because no one can make any money out of it !
philip martin i successfully share journeys with 2 other car drivers that i work with , yet we all live about 10 miles apart along the same route .
the government could provide a wholly road tax funded website to bring together people that share similar journeys .
it is quite conceivable on an industrial estate that people working for different companies may not know of each other , and have travelled in to work from the same area .
in the absence of good public transport this may provide a good alternative .
r pearson you should be able to reduce traffic with a combination of the use of school buses and changing the starting and finishing times of school hours .
pupils seem to be going to school earlier and earlier , i can always tell when the schools are on holiday my journey to manchester takes half the time .
denise jackson , uk limit the number of vehicles on the roads to the present day levels -lrb- 26 m -rrb- .
then only allow a new vehicle on the road network when an old one is scrapped using the vehicle registration system d.woodhead i 've lived in zurich for the last 3 years and lived in reading for 10 years before that .
they are similar in size .
i have n't owned a car in zurich and have had little need to .
within zurich i do everything by tram or bicycle .
i lived a couple of miles out of the city center and had a tram every seven minutes .
in reading , i live a similar distance out and it is a 30 min bus service , unreliable in rush hour because of the traffic .
i now cycle to work across the heart of zurich where bike and pedestrians frequently mingle without hassle . £ 2 a year buys your bike sticker , giving £ 1,000,000 liability insurance .
the swiss are currently building and planning tunnels for 15 years ahead .
the uk needs to invest for the future in its transport systems .
dave walker , uk / switzerland for far too long the tree hugging bunny lovers have held up proper road developments , which this government has successfully hidden behind in the name of the environment .
we want to use our cars , we pay our taxes and the government is there to serve us , the silent majority .
railways are a business with paying customers .
these customers should pay the going rate or find an alternative .
motorists should not have to go on subsidising failing strategies .
give us a decent road system , something mainland europe has had for decades .
tony cohen , england there is of course can be no simple fix-it solution .
offer reasonably priced and reliable public transport that takes people to where they want to go to .
make it unpleasant for car users in cities , especially in the centre .
i think everyone knows that .
it just needs the investment .
mark duke , people make trips because the places they want to go are further away e.g. out-of-town shopping centres .
this is due to 30 years of poor planning .
it will take another 30 to return city centres to be what they should be : centres .
the same applies to public transport : fine when it 's into a hub and out again , impractical when going from one suburban outpost to another .
sam marshall , uk there is too much congestion on the uk 's roads .
public transport will not work , as long as a car can be used .
no matter how inconvenient the car journey , it will be more convenient than a bus or train , neither of which can offer the convenience of travel -lrb- no waiting in the rain for half an hour -rrb- , nor the comfort -lrb- warm , dry , radio playing -rrb- .
i suggest that a major alternative to cars for shorter journeys , especially those in town , is thru the promotion of ptw -lrb- powered two wheelers -rrb- .
now some people complain you 'll get wet riding bikes , and they are dangerous .
well , they are more dangerous than cars , but with driver education , and a greater number of bikes on the road , awareness is bound to increase , and with it safety .
as for getting wet , i get no wetter than when waiting for a bus , but i 'm still home in half the time .
andrew poodle , scotland as a motorist i would rather spend 2 hours in a traffic jam than 30 minutes on stuffy , cramped , out of date , over priced public transport .
it is also impossible to get to most of the places i need to go to by public transport , without the need for an overnight stay .
brian tricker , england it seems to me that this could be a good debate but paul watters does not answer the questions or points that stephen raises .
in particular that most car journeys are very local and have a huge adverse effect on society with little benefit for the driver of most of these journeys .
mike lawrence , uk congestion is an effect but it seems that policy makers have failed to identify the real cause .
as congestion is worse in the mornings and late afternoon on weekdays it is obviously caused by people commuting to work and home again .
my solution is quite simple , reduce the need for people to commute to work through , for example , greater use of homeworking or encourage employers to stagger their start and finishing times , thereby reducing the number of people wishing to use roads at the same time .
other factors such as roadworks and slow-moving loads exacerbate the current problem so these should be eliminated or kept to a minimum during " peak " periods .
paul taylor , nottingham , england invest in the railways and get the majority of trucks off the road , move goods by rail and have trucks collect from the station and deliver from 8pm to 8am .
this would easily free up the motorways and dual carriage ways .
david ward , it is a myth that motorists pay an unfair amount of tax .
people who say this tend to conveniently leave out the cost -lrb- to the nhs -rrb- of road traffic accidents , the cost of policing the roads and of maintenance .
once this is taken into account it turns out that motorists are actually being subsidised by the taxpayer .
laurence taylor , uk we need people who can make the brave and revolutionary changes that are needed need to provide an effective and sustainable transport system .
current levels of traffic growth are unsustainable , and building new roads will only postpone the the time when the real , and probably painfull , changes to the transport system need to be made .
who has the vision to achieve this ?
mike , bristol , uk i live in the country , and although i am only 4 miles from my office in the local town , i do not use public transport or cycle .
the buses are at very inconvenient times and more expensive than the car , and the road is too dangerous for cycling at the time i need to go in to work .
if there was a cycle path , i would use it , but why would the council spend a large sum of money to put in a cycle path just for me and a few others ?
it seems that for those who live in the country , there is very little alternative to the car .
of course , one benefical aspect of the recently suggestion congestion charging , is that it will not affect people who drive in the country , because we have very little congestion !
james hughes , uk no one ever looks beyond the cars and sees the people , our roads are jammed with people .
their cars are secure and private .
road charging will only have a short term effect , it will increase the cost of living and hurt those who can least afford it .
why not tackle the reasons for the jams , why are so very many people trying to get to the same area at the same time ?
as long as we have to earn a crust to survive and it involves having to travel , there will always be jams .
mr brooks , the best way to decrease traffic jams is to make public transport -lrb- buses , trams railways and internal flights -rrb- free to the public and motorists .
for the hauliers , railways should also be free to wean off the heavy goods vehicles from the motorways .
this could be organised on a system similar to nhs in uk .
this idea can then be spread to europe and usa .
people with real physical difficulties should be given free access to door to door services such as taxis and mini-buses .
holiday transport and transfers should also be made free in uk to attract brits out of their cars to much improved public transport .
ken livingstone should adopt this is idea to reduce congestion in london as a pilot project .

emergency action the chip industry was battered by last year 's slowing of demand for personal computers and mobile phones .
the industry 's woes were then compounded by high inventories built up during the boom years .
the tough times drove many semiconductor firms to extreme measures to cut costs and remain afloat .
but despite some positive signs from the chip market , many analysts are waiting for companies to begin corporate spending on technology again before accepting that the bad times are over .
memory hopes and , following the results from the first three months of the year , it became clear that many firms are waiting to be convinced by a recovery in world economic growth before making new investments .
the wsts also predicted burgeoning growth for memory chips , the so-called drams , a key product used in computers .
drams will bounce back by 44.3 % this year , following 2001 's 61.3 % collapse , according to the report .

a motion on gm crops , published by ms mcleod , is to be debated in the scottish parliament in aberdeen on wednesday .

twelve trials of gm oilseed rape have taken place in scotland and the final planting of gm seeds is scheduled to take place next year .

ms mcleod 's motion calls for " the precautionary principle " to be used , halting the field scale trials and restricting future testing to enclosed laboratories .
scientific evidence ms mcleod said : " our motion calls on the liberal democrats to stand by their principles and follow the line agreed at their party conference last month which called for a moratorium on gm crops .
" mr finnie claims there is no scientific evidence to support such a moratorium , but we have new research which we will reveal tomorrow which proves our case and backs up the need for an immediate ban on gm crop field trials . "
anti-gm campaigners opposed to trials taking place at munlochy on the black isle urged msps " to vote with their convictions and listen to their constituents " .
one of the campaigners , anthony jackson , said : " this is especially so for the highland msps who have signed the petition , including maureen macmillan , rhoda grant and jamie stone .
" we are sure that constituents in other areas where gm trials are being carried out will also watch closely to see how their msps vote . "

the biz challenge - backed by the welsh development agency -lrb- wda -rrb- and bbc wales - offers five winners a year 's worth of support and guidance in their chosen venture .
their successes and failures will be filmed for broadcast on bbc wales television .
the nationwide search begins this summer at six events across wales which are open to anyone with a new business idea of any size and in any industry sector .
auditions for a place on the tv series will be judged by a panel of regional business experts including entrepreneurs , agency representatives and the media .
contestants will have just 10 minutes in which to convince the panel that their proposed business venture could be a hit .
wda spokesman daniel jones said it was an exciting new venture for everyone involved .
" we want to tell the human story of starting up your own business and inspire people to become their own boss , " he said .
" the challenge has been laid down - now we need to hear people 's ideas . "
the regional heats are being planned as business advice roadshows , offering tips to people even if they do not want to audition for the tv programme .
jane harvey , presenter of bbc wales tv series the biz , said : " this is a fantastic opportunity for the five winners as we watch them go through their first year in business .
" this is a chance for our winners to be stars not only in business but on tv too . "
winners of the regional heats will go through to a shortlist from which 15 people will be chosen for a selection weekend in the countryside in august .
for three days the group will be tested on a variety of characteristics and skills , ranging from imagination and creativity to financial skills and crisis management .
the wda has turned its focus towards encouraging homegrown enterprise as the key to job creation and prosperity .
a downturn in the global economy has led to a decline in the potential for investment from overseas of the sort that was attracted during the 1980s and much of the 1990s .
however , there is concern at the relative lack of enterprise culture in wales .
in april , analysts at the university of glamorgan warned that wales was lagging behind the rest of the uk in terms of enterprise with 30 % fewer business start-ups .

asylum seekers at south australia 's troubled woomera detention centre had told activists they were planning to greet the un delegation with a hunger strike .
they 've been in there for months , some of them have been in there for years and they are very desperate people activist ross parry the remote desert camp has been the scene of rioting , hunger strikes and escapes over the past year .
the detainees are angry at the length of time taken to process their asylum claims .
" they 're generally gearing up to hopefully make an impact , they wanted to draw attention to the seriousness of how they see the situation , " a protester , ross parry , told australia 's abc radio .
" they 've been in there for months , some of them have been in there for years and they are very desperate people . "
but a spokesman for immigration minister philip ruddock denied there was a hunger strike .
" nobody at the management centre knows about it and people are still turning up for meals , " he said .
indian judge prafullachandra natwarlal bhagwati , envoy for un high commissioner for refugees mary robinson , was to spend the day interviewing detainees along with a un team .
petitioned the un officials asked to visit the centre after about 600 asylum seekers sent them a petition earlier this year .
the group will also visit detention centres in western australia , victoria and new south wales , and will stay in the country until 6 june .
they will report their findings to next year 's session of the commission on human rights .
the un , along with international human rights groups , has criticised australia for its policy of detaining all illegal immigrants while their asylum claims are processed .
there have been several riots at various camps in australia , by detainees protesting at the length of time their applications have taken .
some immigrants can wait more than three years for a decision .
last week australia announced it will offer afghan detainees who have not been granted refugee status , or who are still waiting for a decision on their applications , $ 1,100 -lrb- aus $ 2,000 -rrb- each to head home .
the australian government said the money would be paid as part of a package of measures to persuade people to leave now that afghanistan 's former ruling taleban have been ousted from power .

bbc news online looks at the case .
the 90-year-old woman who had the longest wait in an association of community health councils in england and wales was in an a & e observation ward for over four days .
she had fallen and had pains in her right hip was being cared for at the united hospital aintree , liverpool .
doctors were planning to ensure she was mobile enough to be allowed to go home later that day .
the trust is very disappointed at the interpretation placed on the figures in this report aintree hospitals nhs trust an 81-year-old woman who had knocked her left foot and had swelling had been waiting over 47 hours when achcew carried out its survey at the hospital .
she was waiting to be reviewed by the occupational therapy team .
in the third case , a 94-year-old woman with hypoglycaemia , a low level of glucose in the blood , waited over 30 hours .
doctors planned to continue to monitor her .
' inaccurate ' a statement from the trust said all three cases had been wrongly classed as waiting for significant periods in a & e. james birrell refuted the survey claims " the trust believes this is an inaccurate assessment as patients had been admitted to the observation ward which is a fully staffed ward area accommodating up to 10 patients .
" the trust is very disappointed at the interpretation placed on the figures in this report .
" it is not true to say the patients were in cordoned off areas .
" the observation ward is a separately staffed ward providing privacy and appropriate care for patients admitted there . "
it said : " a & e consultant mr edward kadzcombe confirms the three patients in question would have been specifically admitted to the observation ward as the most suitable place for their clinical needs regardless of the bed situation in the rest of the hospital which , over the period in question , was not under particular pressure . "
trust chief executive james birrell emphasised that the patients received planned and constructive care .
he said : " they received clinically appropriate treatment .
we explained this to the association , but they still decided to use the figures .
" we are basically refuting their claims that we had long-waiting patients . "
the trust said it was normal practice for patients to be assessed and treated in the observation wards over a number of days .
it said not all cases needed to be transferred to specialist wards and some could be allowed home after treatment in the observation ward , once the necessary arrangements had been made with health and social services in the community .
action the trust added many hospitals ' observation units are not as close to a & e as its unit is , so to include waits from there in casualty wait figures was " misleading " .
but the trust said action was being taken to tackle the problems it has sometimes seen with patients experiencing long waits in a & e. it has expanded its medical assessment unit , which assesses and treats medical emergency .
an emergency nurse practitioner service has also been introduced to treat patients classified as ' minor emergencies ' .
in addition , two new consultant physicians in emergency have been appointed to try to build better links between casualty and medical wards .
the trust said it supported the community health council in highlighting patients ' experiences of a & e. it said : " we are determined to ensure that improvements will be delivered . "
trolley wait other patients have said that they have had to endure long waits at the hospital .
john stewart was admitted to the hospital a month ago with chest pains .
he told the bbc he was kept on a trolley in the a & e department for 16 hours before he was given a bed .
" there was no room for me in the main hospital . "
mr stewart said 10-15 other patients - some wearing oxygen mask - were in a similar position while he was waiting for a bed .

however , managers have claimed that the figures do not tell the whole story .
the worst case found in the survey by the association of community health councils in england and wales -lrb- achcew -rrb- was a 90-year-old woman who waited for over 95 hours on a bed in casualty .
resources are overstretched in many hospitals and it is the a & e departments that are taking the strain peter walsh , achcew in the last ever ' casualty watch ' before community health councils are abolished , achcew found patients were being " warehoused " in assessment and observation units in a & e. these units are intended for patients who need monitoring or further tests before doctors decide whether they need to be admitted or discharged .
but achcew said some were being placed in the units simply because there was nowhere else to put them .
' unacceptable waits ' the organisation carried out its survey of how long patients were waiting in a & e on beds , trolleys or chairs in 167 a & e units across england at 1630bst on monday 20 may .
the 20 longest waits recorded ranged from 28 to 95 hours .
the 90-year-old woman who had the longest wait was being cared for at united hospital aintree nhs had fallen and had pains in her right hip .
other long waits highlighted by achcew were : a 66-year-old man with shortness of breath who waited for a bed for over 47 hours at st peter 's hospital , surrey an 81-year-old woman who had a swelling after banging her foot who had waited for just over 47 hours , again at aintree a 52-year-old woman with renal failure who waited 39 hours for a bed at bromley hospital , south london a 78-year-old woman with a fractured arm and head injuries who waited on a trolley for almost 30 hours at the john radcliffe hospital , oxford because there was no bed available a statement from aintree hospitals nhs trust , which had a total of three cases in the list of 20 longest waits said achcew 's figures were inaccurate and should be corrected .
paul birrell , the trust chief executive , said the 90-year-old woman was seen by a doctor within an hour of arrival .
it was decided she needed to be given treatment to raise her blood sugar levels .
" she was very appropriately referred to the observation ward . "
peter walsh , director of achcew said waits of more than 24 hours were " clearly unacceptable " .
he said : " these figures show that resources are overstretched in many hospitals and it is the a & e departments that are taking the strain .
' nowhere else for patients ' he added : " what we are finding is that all too often patients are being warehoused in assessment and observation units until an appropriate bed can be found for them elsewhere in the hospital . "
a & e departments were simply overstretched , he said .
some patients endure long waits on trolleys achcew is calling on the government to publish full data on a & e waits and to tackle discharge delays to free up beds on wards .
a spokesman for the department of health said the 77 % of people attending a & e were admitted , transferred or discharged within the target maximum wait time of 4 hours - and trolley waits of over 12 hours had been reduced by 50 % since 1999 .

however , managers have claimed that the figures do not tell the whole story .
the worst case found in the survey by the association of community health councils in england and wales -lrb- achcew -rrb- was a 90-year-old woman who waited for over 95 hours on a bed in casualty . "
resources are overstretched in many hospitals and it is the a & e departments that are taking the strain " peter walsh , achcew in the last ever ' casualty watch ' before community health councils are abolished , achcew found patients were being " warehoused " in assessment and observation units in a & e. these units are intended for patients who need monitoring or further tests before doctors decide whether they need to be admitted or discharged .
but achcew said some were being placed in the units simply because there was nowhere else to put them .
' unacceptable waits ' the organisation carried out its survey of how long patients were waiting in a & e on beds , trolleys or chairs in 167 a & e units across england at 1630bst on monday 20 may .
the 20 longest waits recorded ranged from 28 to 95 hours .
the 90-year-old woman who had the longest wait was being cared for at united hospital aintree nhs had fallen and had pains in her right hip .
other long waits highlighted by achcew were : a 66-year-old man with shortness of breath who waited for a bed for over 47 hours at st peter 's hospital , surrey an 81-year-old woman who had a swelling after banging her foot who had waited for just over 47 hours , again at aintree a 52-year-old woman with renal failure who waited 39 hours for a bed at bromley hospital , south london a 78-year-old woman with a fractured arm and head injuries who waited on a trolley for almost 30 hours at the john radcliffe hospital , oxford because there was no bed available a statement from aintree hospitals nhs trust , which had a total of three cases in the list of 20 longest waits said achcew 's figures were inaccurate and should be corrected .
paul birrell , the trust chief executive , said the 90-year-old woman was seen by a doctor within an hour of arrival .
it was decided she needed to be given treatment to raise her blood sugar levels .
" she was very appropriately referred to the observation ward . "
peter walsh , director of achcew said waits of more than 24 hours were " clearly unacceptable " .
he said : " these figures show that resources are overstretched in many hospitals and it is the a & e departments that are taking the strain .
' nowhere else for patients ' he added : " what we are finding is that all too often patients are being warehoused in assessment and observation units until an appropriate bed can be found for them elsewhere in the hospital . "
a & e departments were simply overstretched , he said .
achcew is calling on the government to publish full data on a & e waits and to tackle discharge delays to free up beds on wards .
a spokesman for the department of health said the 77 % of people attending a & e were admitted , transferred or discharged within the target maximum wait time of 4 hours - and trolley waits of over 12 hours had been reduced by 50 % since 1999 .
he said £ 118m was being invested in reforming a & e and other emergency care process , including access to gps and social services .
he added : " however , we recognise that a minority of patients still wait too long in a & e. "
he said patients were placed in observation or admissions wards when their condition demanded continuous reassessment .
" often they may be able to be discharged after a certain period of time without being admitted to a ward .
" this is good clinical practice - these wards ensure patients can receive the appropriate care . "
