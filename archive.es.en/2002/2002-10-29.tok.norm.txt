the sullom voe terminal , in shetland , is to be at the heart of a cost-cutting drive by oil giant bp .
bbc scotland has obtained a leaked report which reveals the oil giant wants to halve its costs and decommission some of its processing capacity at the site .
more than 500 workers are emploed at the terminal but the overhaul effect on jobs is not yet known .
sullom voe plant is used for processing thousands of gallons of raw fuel mined from bp 's north sea operations .
the firm , which part-owns the site as one of a consortium of firms and is its biggest employer , would not elaborate on any restructuring but confirmed there had been talks between company management and employees on proposals .
but a spokesman insisted no decisions had yet been taken and could not say what impact the changes would have on jobs and activity at the site .
he said : " there needs to be restructuring of the terminal because of the declining production in the north sea . "
there needs to be restructuring of the terminal because of the declining production in the north sea " a spokesman for bp " there have got to be changes , but what exactly those changes are have still not been decided . "
bp said its sector of the huge terminal , which employs 300 staff and more than 250 contractors , needs to become more competitive .
that drive for greater competitiveness means bp is looking at decommissioning the existing gas plant and building a smaller one at the site .
however , the oil industry in shetland will still be hoping that new discoveries to the west of the islands could lead to a rekindling of the boom time of the 1980s .
global competitiveness at its peak , sullom voe , built 21 years ago , was handling about 1.4m barrels of oil a day , although the figure these days is closer to 600,000 barrels a day .
it was built by 7,000 workers , making it the world 's largest construction project at the time .
any changes at the terminal , owned by a consortium including bp amoco and shell , will be viewed with concern by islanders because oil makes a significant contribution to the local economy .
meanwhile , in aberdeen oil services group weatherford international said it was looking to shed up to 200 jobs to maintain its global competitiveness .
another company - the rolls wood group is making 60 staff redundant , as part of restructuring following a major fire at the company 's repair facility in aberdeen two weeks ago .

her spokesman said megawati would go to the tourist area in kuta which was devastated in the attack , and would meet local officials before returning to the capital , jakarta .
megawati has been accused of weak leadership the visit comes as police prepare to question radical muslim cleric abu bakar ba 'asyir , following his transfer from a hospital in his hometown in central java to jakarta on monday .
the authorities want to ask mr ba 'asyir about his alleged involvement in a number of attacks in south-east asia , and his alleged leadership of a group some governments link with the bali bombing .

they accuse police of kidnapping him , arguing that there are no grounds for arrest .
supporters of the cleric clashed with police on monday mr ba 'asyir had been under detention in his hospital bed since 18 october .
police have been waiting for him to get fit enough to be questioned .
he is accused of involvement in a spate of bomb attacks on christian churches in indonesia in 2000 and an assassination attempt on megawati before she became president .
the cleric is also the alleged leader of the militant jemaah islamiah group , which authorities suspect could have been involved in the bali bombing .
