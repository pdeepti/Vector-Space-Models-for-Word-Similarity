poppy cultivators in afghanistan have defied the thursday deadline to give up cultivating poppies , the flower used for making opium and heroin .
the afghan government has been given $ 21m by the european union to help eradicate this year 's poppy crop .
but angry farmers say the compensation they have been offered to destroy their harvests is insufficient .
armed with assault rifles , security forces have begun destroying the fields in afghanistan 's southern helmand province .
tractors were used to chew up the fields , officials said .
" our work is going on and we will keep destroying poppy crops until they are completely finished , " a spokesman for the helmand governor told the afghan islamic press .
on tuesday protesting farmers blocked a key road from pakistan , preventing thousands of afghan refugees from returning home .
profitable crop government officials sent to the main poppy growing areas of eastern and southern afghanistan have come under attack .
they have been offering the farmers about $ 250 per acre to destroy their poppy crops .
the government has now raised the offer to $ 350 .
after the fall of the taleban , many farmers borrowed money to plant poppies - one of the few profitable crops in the region .
the farmers still have to pay back the cash .
they say the compensation being offered by the government is derisory .
some have shot at government officials and burned their cars .
before the taleban banned poppy growing , afghanistan supplied 90 % of the world 's heroin .
a bbc correspondent in afghanistan says that if the afghan government can not fulfil its promise to eradicate the poppy , it risks losing some of the goodwill of the west , which is helping pay to have the crop destroyed .
the afghan authorities have now asked for more international help in targeting the poppy crops .

john smith , labour member for the vale of glamorgan , was elected chairman of an all-party group set up to investigate the causes of flight-related deep vein thrombosis -lrb- dvt -rrb- .
it is extremely worrying that so many people could be developing these life-threatening conditions and not even be aware of it john smith mp at their first meeting on wednesday , mps heard that as many as one-in-ten people could develop potentially fatal blood clots by remaining seated throughout long-haul flights .
they called for immediate research into the problem , after being told by a medical expert that the absence of immediate symptoms made it difficult for doctors to link dvt with air travel .
consultant surgeon john scurr , of stamford hospital in london , told mps that despite the lack of symptoms , 40 % of those affected developed life-threatening clots that required immediate treatment .
fatal consequences more than 40 long-haul airline passengers have died from dvt clots .
they include emma christoffersen , from newport , susan mavir-ross , from llay in wrexham , thomas lamb , from cardiff , and john thomas from cowbridge , south wales .
emma christoffersen died after a long-haul flight from australia solicitors representing nearly 300 claimants went to the high court in london in january to launch legal proceedings against 30 major airlines .
medical research has shown that clots develop in blood vessels deep in the legs when circulation slows - when people remain seated for long periods , for example .
the clots can prove fatal if they break off and are carried to the lungs , blocking the flow of blood .
several medical reports have claimed a link between dvt and air travel , although it is yet to be proved .
inquiry calls mr smith - whose constituency includes cardiff international airport - said the fact that victims showed no symptoms was a cause for concern .
" it is extremely worrying that so many people could be developing these life-threatening conditions and not even be aware of it .
mp john smith calls for more research he added : " if you consider that it takes between five and nine days for clots to develop , and then travel to the lungs or the heart , it is little wonder that so few dvts are linked directly with air travel as doctors are not required to seek any connection .
" this is all the more reason why research should be undertaken immediately . "
in january , campaigners staged a candlelit vigil outside the house of commons demanding a public inquiry into the health risks of air travel .
uk transport minister john spellar said the government would participate in a world health organisation study into dvt cases , but stopped short of announcing a separate inquiry in britain .
