the government is seeking to ban the group , but concern is growing that missteps over the use of informants in its investigation could derail its case before the federal constitutional court .
the karlsruhe-based court is currently considering three petitions brought against the party by the federal government , parliament and upper legislative chamber .
the trial was set to begin in february , but oral arguments were derailed following a scandal over npd leaders who had served as informants in the government 's case .
at least one was also scheduled to testify as a witness in defense of the npd .
the justices say the government must reveal any members of the npd 's executive leadership who have cooperated with the state and federal government since 1996 .
though the court has said the need to shield informants could make it difficult for the government to turn over every name , it did order it to explain reasons for each omission and determine whether " alternative sources " could be found instead . however , on wednesday , the interior ministers confirmed they had come to an agreement not to reveal the identities of any more informants .
a spokesman for bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , who is leading the government 's effort to ban the party , said the interior ministers came to an agreement in june not to release information that would tip off the npd to informants within the party .
fdp calls on government to drop case in response , the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has renewed its calls for the government to withdraw its case .
" the dangers we 've warned about all along for a successful ban of the npd are increasing , " said jörg van essen , the fdp parliamentary group 's business manager .
the legal issues spokesman for alliance ' 90 / the greens also criticized the unwillingness of the government to reveal the identities of the npd informants .
volker beck pleaded with the government to release the names .
" i support setting aside the protection of the sources because allowing the case to be thwarted would cause greater damage , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper .
but the interior minsters of bavaria and lower saxony , who have been responsible for filing the case , say the informant scandal is not likely to derail it .
a case on hold the constitutional court temporarily suspended the case on january 22 after it learned that a key member of the npd 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the office of the protection of constitution , the domestic intelligence agency whose investigation built the foundations of the government 's case .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the v-leute the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases .
informants , which are called v-leute in german , were also instrumental in the recent effort to ban the union of islamic associations and communities .
the religious group - led by metin kaplan , the self-named and somewhat ghoulish " caliph of cologne , " who is sitting in a german prison on an attempted murder conviction - has called for overturning the german government and introducing islamic law .
the government banned the group under a provision of recently passed anti-terror laws that permit the banning of religious organizations if they pose a threat to national security .
safeguarding the constitution german law provides for the banning of political parties that threaten to undermine democracy in the country , and in its petition to the court , the government said the npd was " aggressively " trying to do so .
in its 53-year history , only two political parties have been banned by the government of the federal republic of germany .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , which had become a magnet for former members of the nationalist socialist party .
then , in 1956 , the court ordered a shut down of the communist party of germany .
it would like to make the npd no. 3 on that list .
the government says the npd 's messages are imbued with " racist , xenophobic and anti-semitic " ideas that " play down " the atrocities committed by the national socialists and " glorify " them . last year alone , the government says , the npd incited violence that led to six deaths .
to many , the party represents a tatooed , stubble-haired , menacing blemish on germany 's image abroad - and they 'd like to have it removed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the government is seeking to ban the group , but concern is growing that missteps over the use of informants in its investigation could derail its case before the federal constitutional court .
the karlsruhe-based court is currently considering three petitions brought against the party by the federal government , parliament and upper legislative chamber .
the trial was set to begin in february , but oral arguments were derailed following a scandal over npd leaders who had served as informants in the government 's case .
at least one was also scheduled to testify as a witness in defense of the npd .
the justices say the government must reveal any members of the npd 's executive leadership who have cooperated with the state and federal government since 1996 .
though the court has said the need to shield informants could make it difficult for the government to turn over every name , it did order it to explain reasons for each omission and determine whether " alternative sources " could be found instead . however , on wednesday , the interior ministers confirmed they had come to an agreement not to reveal the identities of any more informants .
a spokesman for bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , who is leading the government 's effort to ban the party , said the interior ministers came to an agreement in june not to release information that would tip off the npd to informants within the party .
fdp calls on government to drop case in response , the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has renewed its calls for the government to withdraw its case .
" the dangers we 've warned about all along for a successful ban of the npd are increasing , " said jörg van essen , the fdp parliamentary group 's business manager .
the legal issues spokesman for alliance ' 90 / the greens also criticized the unwillingness of the government to reveal the identities of the npd informants .
volker beck pleaded with the government to release the names .
" i support setting aside the protection of the sources because allowing the case to be thwarted would cause greater damage , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper .
but the interior minsters of bavaria and lower saxony , who have been responsible for filing the case , say the informant scandal is not likely to derail it .
a case on hold the constitutional court temporarily suspended the case on january 22 after it learned that a key member of the npd 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the office of the protection of constitution , the domestic intelligence agency whose investigation built the foundations of the government 's case .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the v-leute the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases .
informants , which are called v-leute in german , were also instrumental in the recent effort to ban the union of islamic associations and communities .
the religious group - led by metin kaplan , the self-named and somewhat ghoulish " caliph of cologne , " who is sitting in a german prison on an attempted murder conviction - has called for overturning the german government and introducing islamic law .
the government banned the group under a provision of recently passed anti-terror laws that permit the banning of religious organizations if they pose a threat to national security .
safeguarding the constitution german law provides for the banning of political parties that threaten to undermine democracy in the country , and in its petition to the court , the government said the npd was " aggressively " trying to do so .
in its 53-year history , only two political parties have been banned by the government of the federal republic of germany .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , which had become a magnet for former members of the nationalist socialist party .
then , in 1956 , the court ordered a shut down of the communist party of germany .

the government is seeking to ban the group , but concern is growing that missteps over the use of informants in its investigation could derail its case before the federal constitutional court .
the karlsruhe-based court is currently considering three petitions brought against the party by the federal government , parliament and upper legislative chamber .
the trial was set to begin in february , but oral arguments were derailed following a scandal over npd leaders who had served as informants in the government 's case .
at least one was also scheduled to testify as a witness in defense of the npd .
the justices say the government must reveal any members of the npd 's executive leadership who have cooperated with the state and federal government since 1996 .
though the court has said the need to shield informants could make it difficult for the government to turn over every name , it did order it to explain reasons for each omission and determine whether " alternative sources " could be found instead . however , on wednesday , the interior ministers confirmed they had come to an agreement not to reveal the identities of any more informants .
a spokesman for bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , who is leading the government 's effort to ban the party , said the interior ministers came to an agreement in june not to release information that would tip off the npd to informants within the party .

" the dangers we 've warned about all along for a successful ban of the npd are increasing , " said jörg van essen , the fdp parliamentary group 's business manager .
the legal issues spokesman for alliance ' 90 / the greens also criticized the unwillingness of the government to reveal the identities of the npd informants .

the government is seeking to ban the group , but concern is growing that missteps over the use of informants in its investigation could derail its case before the federal constitutional court .
the karlsruhe-based court is currently considering three petitions brought against the party by the federal government , parliament and upper legislative chamber .
the trial was set to begin in february , but oral arguments were derailed following a scandal over npd leaders who had served as informants in the government 's case .
at least one was also scheduled to testify as a witness in defense of the npd .
the justices say the government must reveal any members of the npd 's executive leadership who have cooperated with the state and federal government since 1996 .
though the court has said the need to shield informants could make it difficult for the government to turn over every name , it did order it to explain reasons for each omission and determine whether " alternative sources " could be found instead . however , on wednesday , the interior ministers confirmed they had come to an agreement not to reveal the identities of any more informants .
a spokesman for bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , who is leading the government 's effort to ban the party , said the interior ministers came to an agreement in june not to release information that would tip off the npd to informants within the party .
fdp calls on government to drop case in response , the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has renewed its calls for the government to withdraw its case .
" the dangers we 've warned about all along for a successful ban of the npd are increasing , " said jörg van essen , the fdp parliamentary group 's business manager .
the legal issues spokesman for alliance ' 90 / the greens also criticized the unwillingness of the government to reveal the identities of the npd informants .
volker beck pleaded with the government to release the names .
" i support setting aside the protection of the sources because allowing the case to be thwarted would cause greater damage , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper .
but the interior minsters of bavaria and lower saxony , who have been responsible for filing the case , say the informant scandal is not likely to derail it .
a case on hold the constitutional court temporarily suspended the case on january 22 after it learned that a key member of the npd 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the office of the protection of constitution , the domestic intelligence agency whose investigation built the foundations of the government 's case .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the v-leute the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases .
informants , which are called v-leute in german , were also instrumental in the recent effort to ban the union of islamic associations and communities .
the religious group - led by metin kaplan , the self-named and somewhat ghoulish " caliph of cologne , " who is sitting in a german prison on an attempted murder conviction - has called for overturning the german government and introducing islamic law .
the government banned the group under a provision of recently passed anti-terror laws that permit the banning of religious organizations if they pose a threat to national security .
safeguarding the constitution german law provides for the banning of political parties that threaten to undermine democracy in the country , and in its petition to the court , the government said the npd was " aggressively " trying to do so .
in its 53-year history , only two political parties have been banned by the government of the federal republic of germany .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , which had become a magnet for former members of the nationalist socialist party .
then , in 1956 , the court ordered a shut down of the communist party of germany .
it would like to make the npd no. 3 on that list .
the government says the npd 's messages are imbued with " racist , xenophobic and anti-semitic " ideas that " play down " the atrocities committed by the national socialists and " glorify " them . last year alone , the government says , the npd incited violence that led to six deaths .
to many , the party represents a tatooed , stubble-haired , menacing blemish on germany 's image abroad - and they 'd like to have it removed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the government is seeking to ban the group , but concern is growing that missteps over the use of informants in its investigation could derail its case before the federal constitutional court .
the karlsruhe-based court is currently considering three petitions brought against the party by the federal government , parliament and upper legislative chamber .
the trial was set to begin in february , but oral arguments were derailed following a scandal over npd leaders who had served as informants in the government 's case .
at least one was also scheduled to testify as a witness in defense of the npd .
the justices say the government must reveal any members of the npd 's executive leadership who have cooperated with the state and federal government since 1996 .
though the court has said the need to shield informants could make it difficult for the government to turn over every name , it did order it to explain reasons for each omission and determine whether " alternative sources " could be found instead . however , on wednesday , the interior ministers confirmed they had come to an agreement not to reveal the identities of any more informants .
a spokesman for bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , who is leading the government 's effort to ban the party , said the interior ministers came to an agreement in june not to release information that would tip off the npd to informants within the party .
fdp calls on government to drop case in response , the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has renewed its calls for the government to withdraw its case .
" the dangers we 've warned about all along for a successful ban of the npd are increasing , " said jörg van essen , the fdp parliamentary group 's business manager .
the legal issues spokesman for alliance ' 90 / the greens also criticized the unwillingness of the government to reveal the identities of the npd informants .
volker beck pleaded with the government to release the names .
" i support setting aside the protection of the sources because allowing the case to be thwarted would cause greater damage , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper .
but the interior minsters of bavaria and lower saxony , who have been responsible for filing the case , say the informant scandal is not likely to derail it .
a case on hold the constitutional court temporarily suspended the case on january 22 after it learned that a key member of the npd 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the office of the protection of constitution , the domestic intelligence agency whose investigation built the foundations of the government 's case .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the v-leute the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases .
informants , which are called v-leute in german , were also instrumental in the recent effort to ban the union of islamic associations and communities .
the religious group - led by metin kaplan , the self-named and somewhat ghoulish " caliph of cologne , " who is sitting in a german prison on an attempted murder conviction - has called for overturning the german government and introducing islamic law .
the government banned the group under a provision of recently passed anti-terror laws that permit the banning of religious organizations if they pose a threat to national security .
safeguarding the constitution german law provides for the banning of political parties that threaten to undermine democracy in the country , and in its petition to the court , the government said the npd was " aggressively " trying to do so .
in its 53-year history , only two political parties have been banned by the government of the federal republic of germany .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , which had become a magnet for former members of the nationalist socialist party .
then , in 1956 , the court ordered a shut down of the communist party of germany .
it would like to make the npd no. 3 on that list .
the government says the npd 's messages are imbued with " racist , xenophobic and anti-semitic " ideas that " play down " the atrocities committed by the national socialists and " glorify " them . last year alone , the government says , the npd incited violence that led to six deaths .
to many , the party represents a tatooed , stubble-haired , menacing blemish on germany 's image abroad - and they 'd like to have it removed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the government is seeking to ban the group , but concern is growing that missteps over the use of informants in its investigation could derail its case before the federal constitutional court .
the karlsruhe-based court is currently considering three petitions brought against the party by the federal government , parliament and upper legislative chamber .
the trial was set to begin in february , but oral arguments were derailed following a scandal over npd leaders who had served as informants in the government 's case .
at least one was also scheduled to testify as a witness in defense of the npd .
the justices say the government must reveal any members of the npd 's executive leadership who have cooperated with the state and federal government since 1996 .
though the court has said the need to shield informants could make it difficult for the government to turn over every name , it did order it to explain reasons for each omission and determine whether " alternative sources " could be found instead . however , on wednesday , the interior ministers confirmed they had come to an agreement not to reveal the identities of any more informants .
a spokesman for bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , who is leading the government 's effort to ban the party , said the interior ministers came to an agreement in june not to release information that would tip off the npd to informants within the party .
fdp calls on government to drop case in response , the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has renewed its calls for the government to withdraw its case .
" the dangers we 've warned about all along for a successful ban of the npd are increasing , " said jörg van essen , the fdp parliamentary group 's business manager .
the legal issues spokesman for alliance ' 90 / the greens also criticized the unwillingness of the government to reveal the identities of the npd informants .
volker beck pleaded with the government to release the names .
" i support setting aside the protection of the sources because allowing the case to be thwarted would cause greater damage , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper .
but the interior minsters of bavaria and lower saxony , who have been responsible for filing the case , say the informant scandal is not likely to derail it .
a case on hold the constitutional court temporarily suspended the case on january 22 after it learned that a key member of the npd 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the office of the protection of constitution , the domestic intelligence agency whose investigation built the foundations of the government 's case .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .

" the dangers we 've warned about all along for a successful ban of the npd are increasing , " said jörg van essen , the fdp parliamentary group 's business manager .
the legal issues spokesman for alliance ' 90 / the greens also criticized the unwillingness of the government to reveal the identities of the npd informants .
volker beck pleaded with the government to release the names .
" i support setting aside the protection of the sources because allowing the case to be thwarted would cause greater damage , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper .
but the interior minsters of bavaria and lower saxony , who have been responsible for filing the case , say the informant scandal is not likely to derail it .
a case on hold the constitutional court temporarily suspended the case on january 22 after it learned that a key member of the npd 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the office of the protection of constitution , the domestic intelligence agency whose investigation built the foundations of the government 's case .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the v-leute the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases .
informants , which are called v-leute in german , were also instrumental in the recent effort to ban the union of islamic associations and communities .
the religious group - led by metin kaplan , the self-named and somewhat ghoulish " caliph of cologne , " who is sitting in a german prison on an attempted murder conviction - has called for overturning the german government and introducing islamic law .
the government banned the group under a provision of recently passed anti-terror laws that permit the banning of religious organizations if they pose a threat to national security .
safeguarding the constitution german law provides for the banning of political parties that threaten to undermine democracy in the country , and in its petition to the court , the government said the npd was " aggressively " trying to do so .
in its 53-year history , only two political parties have been banned by the government of the federal republic of germany .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , which had become a magnet for former members of the nationalist socialist party .
then , in 1956 , the court ordered a shut down of the communist party of germany .
it would like to make the npd no. 3 on that list .
the government says the npd 's messages are imbued with " racist , xenophobic and anti-semitic " ideas that " play down " the atrocities committed by the national socialists and " glorify " them . last year alone , the government says , the npd incited violence that led to six deaths .

the government is seeking to ban the group , but concern is growing that missteps over the use of informants in its investigation could derail its case before the federal constitutional court .
the karlsruhe-based court is currently considering three petitions brought against the party by the federal government , parliament and upper legislative chamber .
the trial was set to begin in february , but oral arguments were derailed following a scandal over npd leaders who had served as informants in the government 's case .
at least one was also scheduled to testify as a witness in defense of the npd .
the justices say the government must reveal any members of the npd 's executive leadership who have cooperated with the state and federal government since 1996 .
though the court has said the need to shield informants could make it difficult for the government to turn over every name , it did order it to explain reasons for each omission and determine whether " alternative sources " could be found instead . however , on wednesday , the interior ministers confirmed they had come to an agreement not to reveal the identities of any more informants .

the government is seeking to ban the group , but concern is growing that missteps over the use of informants in its investigation could derail its case before the federal constitutional court .
the karlsruhe-based court is currently considering three petitions brought against the party by the federal government , parliament and upper legislative chamber .
the trial was set to begin in february , but oral arguments were derailed following a scandal over npd leaders who had served as informants in the government 's case .
at least one was also scheduled to testify as a witness in defense of the npd .
the justices say the government must reveal any members of the npd 's executive leadership who have cooperated with the state and federal government since 1996 .
though the court has said the need to shield informants could make it difficult for the government to turn over every name , it did order it to explain reasons for each omission and determine whether " alternative sources " could be found instead . however , on wednesday , the interior ministers confirmed they had come to an agreement not to reveal the identities of any more informants .
a spokesman for bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , who is leading the government 's effort to ban the party , said the interior ministers came to an agreement in june not to release information that would tip off the npd to informants within the party .
fdp calls on government to drop case in response , the opposition free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- has renewed its calls for the government to withdraw its case .
" the dangers we 've warned about all along for a successful ban of the npd are increasing , " said jörg van essen , the fdp parliamentary group 's business manager .
the legal issues spokesman for alliance ' 90 / the greens also criticized the unwillingness of the government to reveal the identities of the npd informants .
volker beck pleaded with the government to release the names .
" i support setting aside the protection of the sources because allowing the case to be thwarted would cause greater damage , " he told the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper .
but the interior minsters of bavaria and lower saxony , who have been responsible for filing the case , say the informant scandal is not likely to derail it .
a case on hold the constitutional court temporarily suspended the case on january 22 after it learned that a key member of the npd 's leadership had at one point served as an informant for the office of the protection of constitution , the domestic intelligence agency whose investigation built the foundations of the government 's case .
the court learned that part of the government 's case had been gleaned from wolfgang frenz , an npd official and witness for the defense who had worked as an informant for the north rhine-westphalia state office for the protection of the constitution .
days later , it learned that udo holtmann , head of the npd 's state chapter in north rhine-westphalia , had also aided in the government 's case .
the v-leute the government has said it must rely on unidentified informants in such cases .
informants , which are called v-leute in german , were also instrumental in the recent effort to ban the union of islamic associations and communities .
the religious group - led by metin kaplan , the self-named and somewhat ghoulish " caliph of cologne , " who is sitting in a german prison on an attempted murder conviction - has called for overturning the german government and introducing islamic law .
the government banned the group under a provision of recently passed anti-terror laws that permit the banning of religious organizations if they pose a threat to national security .
safeguarding the constitution german law provides for the banning of political parties that threaten to undermine democracy in the country , and in its petition to the court , the government said the npd was " aggressively " trying to do so .
in its 53-year history , only two political parties have been banned by the government of the federal republic of germany .
in 1952 , it banned the socialist reich party , which had become a magnet for former members of the nationalist socialist party .

the us attorney in worldcom 's home state of mississippi had been due to probe allegations of fraud at the firm , which recently admitted $ 3.8bn -lrb- £ 2.5bn -rrb- in accounting irregularities .
but dunn lampton , who heads the us attorney 's office in jackson , mississippi , owned worldcom stock , leading to his removal from handling the case .
worldcom is being sued in new york by the securities and exchange commission , which alleges that the irregularities were a prolonged and concerted fraud on the part of senior management .
the shift in jurisdiction could allow matters to proceed more quickly , the us department of justice hopes .
swat team talk the need for speed in the worldcom investigation has been sparked by a speech earlier this week from president george w bush , in which he called for tougher penalties against corporate lawbreakers .
he ordered the creation of a justice department task force , which he described as a " financial crimes swat team " to run investigations into corporate malpractice .
the us attorney 's office in manhattan is part of that task force .
conflicts of interest often arise when local officials are asked to investigate companies in their district .
a similar removal occured in recent investigations into failed energy firm enron , and attorney general john ashcroft removed himself from the probe because he had once received campaign contributions from the company .

the government should look at increasing tuition fees - with perhaps a premium for attending the best universities .
main proposals more ' realistic ' student loans higher interest rates for the better off possible higher tuition fees possible ' top-up ' fees ' all-through ' grants from 16 the report on student funding from the commons education select committee also notes that the existing system has failed to get more working class students into higher education .
it says the government should think about having a new system that would run all the way from age 16 to at least the end of the first year of higher education .
this might use , as a model , the education maintenance allowances which have been piloted in a number of areas , which pay poorer students to stay on in education or training after the age of 16 .
these emas are favoured by the chancellor , gordon brown - who has always planned to pay for them by ending universal child benefit for the over-16s who are still in education .
students ' concerns duff advice but the labour-dominated select committee says there will not be much " social inclusion " unless the government does a much better job of explaining the practical effects of its policies to students and their families .
" critically , the information for current and prospective students must convey the notion that while a good quality education may require financial sacrifices , it is an investment that is usually worth making . "
studies repeatedly show that - although students typically graduate more than £ 10,000 in debt - having a degree pays big dividends in higher salaries over a working life .
yet the fear of debt tends to deter most precisely those students ministers most want to attract , as part of their drive to have half of all young people experiencing higher education by 2010 .
tuition fees these are the people from " non-traditional " backgrounds .
that is , those with no family history of going to university - typically the less well off .
one of the committee 's findings is that the 10 % " postcode premium " universities get in extra funding for taking students from disadvantaged areas is not enough .
but fees and loans are the mps ' main focus .
they recommend keeping means-tested contributions to the cost of tuition - currently up to £ 1,075 a year for the better off , with about 42 % of all students paying nothing .
the report 's recommendations typify its approach of making the better off pay more to subsidise the poorer .
it says the government should review the maximum level of the fees - and the income threshold at which students start to pay them .
top-up fees and loans the mps say there has been " much heat and little light " shed on the debate about so-called top-up fees - letting universities charge more for some courses , perhaps the most highly regarded or over-subscribed .
they say simply that there is a serious debate to be had and the government should not shrink from evaluating the idea .
their report says the maximum student loan should be " set at a level that reflects the realistic costs of pursuing a full-time course of study " .
this needs to sidestep " sensationalising " debates about whether the taxpayer should subsidise " allegedly extravagant spending " .
but members of the committee say they have become convinced that the subsidy on loans - with an interest rate meeting only the cost of inflation - benefits those who do not need it as well as those who do .
so there is " considerable scope " for adjustable interest rates - which might be tweaked to suit economic conditions or policy towards particular groups of students or subject areas .
the committee says the government should " make careful appraisals " of the welsh and scottish use of grants for poorer students - with , in scotland , no fees and instead a tax on graduates ' earnings .
yet it does not recommend the adoption of either approach for england .

this might use , as a model , the education maintenance allowances which have been piloted in a number of areas , which pay poorer students to stay on in education or training after the age of 16 .
these emas are favoured by the chancellor , gordon brown - who has always planned to pay for them by ending universal child benefit for the over-16s who are still in education .
students ' concerns duff advice but the labour-dominated select committee says there will not be much " social inclusion " unless the government does a much better job of explaining the practical effects of its policies to students and their families .
" critically , the information for current and prospective students must convey the notion that while a good quality education may require financial sacrifices , it is an investment that is usually worth making . "
studies repeatedly show that - although students typically graduate more than £ 10,000 in debt - having a degree pays big dividends in higher salaries over a working life .
yet the fear of debt tends to deter most precisely those students ministers most want to attract , as part of their drive to have half of all young people experiencing higher education by 2010 .
tuition fees these are the people from " non-traditional " backgrounds .
that is , those with no family history of going to university - typically the less well off .
one of the committee 's findings is that the 10 % " postcode premium " universities get in extra funding for taking students from disadvantaged areas is not enough .
but fees and loans are the mps ' main focus .
they recommend keeping means-tested contributions to the cost of tuition - currently up to £ 1,075 a year for the better off , with about 42 % of all students paying nothing .
the report 's recommendations typify its approach of making the better off pay more to subsidise the poorer .
it says the government should review the maximum level of the fees - and the income threshold at which students start to pay them .
top-up fees and loans the mps say there has been " much heat and little light " shed on the debate about so-called top-up fees - letting universities charge more for some courses , perhaps the most highly regarded or over-subscribed .
they say simply that there is a serious debate to be had and the government should not shrink from evaluating the idea .
their report says the maximum student loan should be " set at a level that reflects the realistic costs of pursuing a full-time course of study " .
this needs to sidestep " sensationalising " debates about whether the taxpayer should subsidise " allegedly extravagant spending " .
but members of the committee say they have become convinced that the subsidy on loans - with an interest rate meeting only the cost of inflation - benefits those who do not need it as well as those who do .
so there is " considerable scope " for adjustable interest rates - which might be tweaked to suit economic conditions or policy towards particular groups of students or subject areas .
the committee says the government should " make careful appraisals " of the welsh and scottish use of grants for poorer students - with , in scotland , no fees and instead a tax on graduates ' earnings .
yet it does not recommend the adoption of either approach for england . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's mike baker " these proposals would particularly hit the students from middle-class homes " click for more on university fees latest news higher university fees confirmed what the strategy says anger over higher fees wales ' set free ' £ 21,000 debt analysis : mike baker the ' multiversity ' different approaches scots ' warning uk divisions other countries ' systems oz students pay later forum put questions to an expert 1830gmt talking point is the degree worth the debt ?

virgin atlantic airways is poised to announce that it is restoring more uk-us flights which were axed after the 11 september terror strikes , a report said .
the move by the carrier , controlled by entrepreneur sir richard branson , eases some of the gloom which has surrounded the longhaul travel market since the attacks .
airports operator baa on wednesday revealed that it carried 10 % fewer transatlantic passengers last month than in june 2001 .
and it represents a further fillip for sir richard 's airline interests , coming the day after virgin express , 59 % owned by his virgin group investments company , said it planned to open a base at cologne-bonn airport .
revival race virgin atlantic will this autumn reinstate a fifth daily heathrow-new york service , with a second daily service to washington planned for next summer , the financial times said .
the number of flights from gatwick and manchester to orlando will rise in a year 's time from 20 a week to 24 , the newspaper added .
the additions will help the firm recover by next summer its pre-11 september capacity , the carrier said , and will be viewed as the latest of a series of signals that virgin atlantic is recovering from last travel slump quicker than rival british airways .
while ba last week said it was not budgeting for increased revenues in coming months , virgin atlantic put in a sufficiently strong recovery to post an underlying profit in the first three months of the year .
' long haul back ' virgin atlantic , which lost £ 90m overall in the year to april , is hoping for a significantly improved performance this year , chief financial officer julie southern told the ft .
" it will be a long haul back , " she said .
" we are driving to return to profitability this year , but it is still uncertain . "
the carrier has credited its recovery to its focus on leisure , rather than business , travellers .
virgin atlantic cut capacity by about 20 % following the 11 september strikes , and slashed fares in a bid to bolster passenger numbers .

the unprecedented £ 100m public investment will also help pay for high-speed satellite links to small businesses in rural areas . "
we must have strong communication infrastructure " economic development minister andrew davies it funds the assembly government 's new broadband wales programme , which aims to thread fast web benefits through the fabric of welsh life , pushing the internet into areas uncatered for by current packages .
it is the biggest government broadband investment ever in the uk , according to economic development minister andrew davies .
have your say broadband cables can transfer large amounts of data between internet users in neighbouring communities or around the world .
they let customers enjoy broadcast-quality films , video conferencing and other facilities , and allow enterprises to conduct meaningful business without moving to broadband hotspots .
viable investment but bt has been criticised for the pace of its conversion of welsh telephone exchanges to high-speed adsl capacity .
and ntl 's fast cable internet access is only available in certain parts because the companies feel wales-wide roll-out is not commercially viable , particularly rural communities .
together with £ 23m from the welsh development agency , the welsh assembly is now intervening to put wales on a " level playing field " .
ministers want to drive down the cost of these terrestrial packages by 30 % , bringing broadband to 310,00 more homes and 67,000 businesses by 2007 .
targetted cash they will also wire up all business parks and mount a high-profile promotion campaign .
those aims will be targetted from april 2003 , when broadband wales becomes fully operational under " high-profile " directorship at cardiff bay .
but the interim programme subsidising the cost of satellite connections to small businesses from september .
wales already joins northern ireland at the foot of the uk 's internet ladder , while the uk still trails european neighbours in the race to create a broadband nation .
ireland , for example , unveiled in march a 300m euro programme to build a 50,000km fibre optic broadband network linking 123 towns and cities .
but , while the irish government is managing a competition-neutral public / private partnership , the welsh assembly government can only work to encourage private access providers ' investment .
wealth generation andrew davies said : " to build a more prosperous wales for the future we must have strong communication infrastructure .
" it is essential to help us generate more wealth , give people more skills and ensure that wales plays its full place in the modern world .
" -lsb- this -rsb- will push wales ahead of the rest of the uk in public broadband access . "
" it is essential to help us generate more wealth , give people more skills and ensure that wales plays its full place in the modern world " andrew davies telecoms entrepreneur sir terry matthews said : " it will lower barriers to markets for welsh products across the globe and ... allow us to get into high growth industries such as bioinformatics , genomics and micromachines . "
wda chief executive graham hawker added : " the availability of affordable higher bandwidth services will enable welsh businesses to compete more effectively in the global marketplace regardless of their location . "
the agency and the assembly will be " aggregating public sector monies " including european objective one funds to pay for the project , including £ 23m committed earlier from the assembly .
it follows the cymru arlein strategy published by the cardiff bay administration in 2001 , which called for more widespread internet access and has already begun to wire up libraries around wales .
bbc news online readers ' comments on the welsh assembly announcement " looks good but what is the point when there is no intenetion to provide in my area at marshfield for years ! ! ! ! ! ! "
ian purnell , wales " adsl and other forms of " high-speed " internet access may not actually improve the situation for home users in the long run unless web designers finally come to realise that they should not fill their pages with so much junk code and flashy graphics .
my fear is that with faster access designers will just fill the pipe with even more rubbish . "
robin , n. ireland " finally !
we 're getting broadband , but i just fear that the big cities may once again have preference when it comes to being ' the chosen one ' .
a 10-year plan for broadband , in my opinion , comes too late and , by the time it 's completed halfway , it 's most likely to be outdated .
we 'll never get ahead this way in the technology battle in wales .
however , when it gets here , i will receive it with open arms .
broadband has been available for over three years now ... it 's about time wales reeps some of the benefits . "
han proveniers , adventure graphix ltd , wales " however , i would like to know how this money is likely to be spent .
will it be used to subsidise bt to provide xdsl services where exchanges are not curently enabled , or will wales create it 's own broadband network , using technologies like wireless -lrb- 802.11b -rrb- and fibre -lrb- where i have heard of european grants availible for setup of this type of network -rrb- , to compete with our european neighbours , where 10mbps and 100mbps connections to homes are common-place ? "
peter sheppard , newport , wales , uk " announcements are all well and good , but how do we , the individual citizens of wales , actually get help with broadband access ?
while the assembly talks , wales is losing jobs .
at this rate , there 'll be no-one left who can afford a computer to hook up to broadband " stuart herbert , pontypridd , wales " this is a good , bold move .
they have set some high targets , which the uk government has failed to do .
they are building demand ahead of supply by grouping 1,200 public sector organisations whose business private sector companies will chase .
they want to enhance all media , but a lot of exact detail is missing . "
andy williams , broadband4britain , chepstow " great news for wales ! !
here 's hoping they look beyond bt for solutions ; -rrb- and schools are due to get £ 350 mill ! ! ! ! "
steve fossey , stream media " this announcement is very positive .
if this announcement lives up to the hype , broadband access should no longer be a problem , allowing us to grow our business within wales .
we are very keen to see the changes introduced as quicky as possible and are hopeful that subsidy of satelite access by september , means september ! "
steve aicheler , blushingbuyer.co.uk " this is n't £ 100m of new money , it includes the £ 18.4m from october .
it 's all good publicity when mr andrew davies releases such large amounts of money , but since the last investment of £ 18.4m , we have n't seen a single broadband connection as a direct result - so do n't get your hopes up .
i truly hope that this time the government will stick their hands in their pockets and spend it wisely .
i would also call upon andrew davies to start spending this money asap . "
darren powles , broadband for wales " i assume the £ 100m spend will be funded from welsh taxpayers as the initiative is coming from the welsh assembly .
no taxation without representation -lrb- as someone once said in a similar situation -rrb- . "
john bull , england " the funding is excellent and the subsidies are superb for businesses .
but the problem in wales is that there is no demand .
businesses do n't know how to benefit from the internet and i do n't believe government organisations have a good understanding of that .
there needs to be an awareness campaign , or this announcement wo n't change the attitude of businesses in wales . "
jeremy rollinson , ruraldsl campaign , powys " broadband should be available to everyone .
the rest of the world have got it - why ca n't wales have it ?
come on the welsh office ; show bt what to do .
i am from merthyr tydfil - also disabled - and i would like broadband very much .
very disappointed with bt - with all our technology , why are we waiting ? "
paul , wales , uk " fantastic - now people in wales can have 24-hour access to pornograph , y too . £ 100m of government money well spent , i think . "
frank , uk " nice for wales , but i live in hertfordshire , 17 miles from london and there are ' no plans ' to upgrade our rural exchange .
satellite is too expensive , so who will subsidise adsl in rural hertfordshire ? "
rod , england , uk " excellent news for wales .
something like this is needed .
the demand may not be there now , but i 'm sure it will be by the time this has got off the ground .
now how about the rest of us ?
bt is n't even interested in whether or not people where i live want broadband .
how about scotland ?
the rural areas there need help too . "
steve knight , devon " this surely could be damaging for the already ailing employment situation in wales .
with dismissals at work for searching for porn on the rise , i can see that as the internet gets faster then dismissals for looking at lewd pictures at work can only increase ! ! "
alex , uk / russia " the only way to get full national coverage is via satellite .
and it is both two-way -lrb- premium -rrb- and hybrid -lrb- less expensive -rrb- - which is what we told the welsh assembly in aug 2001 .
project just got sunk and mired for some reason .
shame really - only needed less than £ 3m to put dedicated welsh platform in place ... "
rory , uk " i myself am a young online gamer .
me and many of my friends all have to live with a nasty 56k connection which only connects at a max of 28.8k due to bt lowering the quality of our lines .
it is nearly impossible to play games on public servers because the ping becomes far to high and we get lots of lag .
the entire rhondda cynon taff area has a bad internet connection on conventional lines and it 's about time broadband is coming into our area .
we were promised adsl connections in 2000 but bt stopped its campagin .
if this one is never put forward , there will be a lot of angry welsh citizens ! "
luke geach , tonyrefail , wales " i am from blackwood in gwent , where there are thousands of internet users .
bt do not consider it viable to include us in their roll-out , whereas abergavenny , a comparatively small town , gets broadband in september .
it seems that bt have cherry-picked the areas in which it will be easier to set up broadband .
will broadband wales have the same plans ?
i assume so . "
bernie matthews , wales " i would like to know how this money is likely to be spent .
will it be used to subsidise bt to provide xdsl services where exchanges are not curently enabled -lrb- taking note of the fact that xdsl is limited to 5km cable length from the exchange , so probably impractical for most of rural wales -rrb- , or will wales create it 's own broadband network , using technologies like wireless -lrb- 802.11b -rrb- and fibre -lrb- where i have heard of european grants availible for setup of this type of network -rrb- , to compete with our european neighbours , where 10mbps and 100mbps connections to homes are common-place ?
is this money just going to be indirectly pumped straight into the pockets of the bt shareholders ? ! "
peter sheppard , newport , wales , uk " having recently moved to snowdonia whilst working in manchesster still - where , as a nurse , i have broadband at both home and work - i have to say that i would be glad of the ability to even receive a half decent tv picture .
broadband is fantastic , as anyone who uses it knows .
the enormity of difference between the levels of technological awareness between the two areas of my life is frightening .
this package and any accompanying drive to inform and integrate must also be applied to home users in rural wales , not only businesses , so that full exploitation of the possibilities of the internet can be realised by the next generation , not just the businessmen of today .
if not , then i fear many will be left so far behind that no discernable benefit will be gained .
it is by putting these tools into ordinary peoples hands that development and understanding and opportunity arises ... " let the children play " . "

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- wales -pipe- £ 100m to speed up internet access news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : uk : wales news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england n ireland scotland wales politics education business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk thursday , 11 july , 2002 , 06:26 gmt 07:26 uk £ 100m to speed up internet access oftel says it wants to see cheaper broadband services welsh assembly ministers have pledged to subsidise the cost of commercial broadband internet access for 310,000 homes .
the unprecedented £ 100m public investment will also help pay for high-speed satellite links to small businesses in rural areas .
we must have strong communication infrastructure economic development minister andrew davies it funds the assembly government 's new broadband wales programme , which aims to thread fast web benefits through the fabric of welsh life , pushing the internet into areas uncatered for by current packages .
it is the biggest government broadband investment ever in the uk , according to economic development minister andrew davies .
broadband cables can transfer large amounts of data between internet users in neighbouring communities or around the world .
they let customers enjoy broadcast-quality films , video conferencing and other facilities , and allow enterprises to conduct meaningful business without moving to broadband hotspots .
viable investment but bt has been criticised for the pace of its conversion of welsh telephone exchanges to high-speed adsl capacity .
and ntl 's fast cable internet access is only available in certain parts because the companies feel wales-wide roll-out is not commercially viable , particularly rural communities .
together with £ 23m from the welsh development agency , the welsh assembly is now intervening to put wales on a " level playing field " .
ministers want to drive down the cost of these terrestrial packages by 30 % , bringing broadband to 310,00 more homes and 67,000 businesses by 2007 .
targetted cash they will also wire up all business parks and mount a high-profile promotion campaign .
those aims will be targetted from april 2003 , when broadband wales becomes fully operational under " high-profile " directorship at cardiff bay .
satellite broadband will be rolled out but the interim programme subsidising the cost of satellite connections to small businesses from september .
wales already joins northern ireland at the foot of the uk 's internet ladder , while the uk still trails european neighbours in the race to create a broadband nation .
ireland , for example , unveiled in march a 300m euro programme to build a 50,000km fibre optic broadband network linking 123 towns and cities .
but , while the irish government is managing a competition-neutral public / private partnership , the welsh assembly government can only work to encourage private access providers ' investment .
wealth generation andrew davies said : " to build a more prosperous wales for the future we must have strong communication infrastructure .
" it is essential to help us generate more wealth , give people more skills and ensure that wales plays its full place in the modern world .
" -lsb- this -rsb- will push wales ahead of the rest of the uk in public broadband access . "
it is essential to help us generate more wealth , give people more skills and ensure that wales plays its full place in the modern world andrew davies telecoms entrepreneur sir terry matthews said : " it will lower barriers to markets for welsh products across the globe and ... allow us to get into high growth industries such as bioinformatics , genomics and micromachines . "
wda chief executive graham hawker added : " the availability of affordable higher bandwidth services will enable welsh businesses to compete more effectively in the global marketplace regardless of their location . "
the agency and the assembly will be " aggregating public sector monies " including european objective one funds to pay for the project , including £ 23m committed earlier from the assembly .
it follows the cymru arlein strategy published by the cardiff bay administration in 2001 , which called for more widespread internet access and has already begun to wire up libraries around wales .
bbc news online readers ' comments on the welsh assembly announcement looks good but what is the point when there is no intenetion to provide in my area at marshfield for years ! ! ! ! ! !
ian purnell , wales adsl and other forms of " high-speed " internet access may not actually improve the situation for home users in the long run unless web designers finally come to realise that they should not fill their pages with so much junk code and flashy graphics .
my fear is that with faster access designers will just fill the pipe with even more rubbish .
robin , n. ireland finally !
we 're getting broadband , but i just fear that the big cities may once again have preference when it comes to being ' the chosen one ' .
a 10-year plan for broadband , in my opinion , comes too late and , by the time it 's completed halfway , it 's most likely to be outdated .
we 'll never get ahead this way in the technology battle in wales .
however , when it gets here , i will receive it with open arms .
broadband has been available for over three years now ... it 's about time wales reeps some of the benefits .
han proveniers , adventure graphix ltd , wales however , i would like to know how this money is likely to be spent .
will it be used to subsidise bt to provide xdsl services where exchanges are not curently enabled , or will wales create it 's own broadband network , using technologies like wireless -lrb- 802.11b -rrb- and fibre -lrb- where i have heard of european grants availible for setup of this type of network -rrb- , to compete with our european neighbours , where 10mbps and 100mbps connections to homes are common-place ?
peter sheppard , newport , wales , uk announcements are all well and good , but how do we , the individual citizens of wales , actually get help with broadband access ?
while the assembly talks , wales is losing jobs .
at this rate , there 'll be no-one left who can afford a computer to hook up to broadband stuart herbert , pontypridd , wales this is a good , bold move .
they have set some high targets , which the uk government has failed to do .
they are building demand ahead of supply by grouping 1,200 public sector organisations whose business private sector companies will chase .
they want to enhance all media , but a lot of exact detail is missing .
andy williams , broadband4britain , chepstow great news for wales ! !
here 's hoping they look beyond bt for solutions ; -rrb- and schools are due to get £ 350 mill ! ! ! !
steve fossey , stream media this announcement is very positive .
if this announcement lives up to the hype , broadband access should no longer be a problem , allowing us to grow our business within wales .
we are very keen to see the changes introduced as quicky as possible and are hopeful that subsidy of satelite access by september , means september !
steve aicheler , blushingbuyer.co.uk this is n't £ 100m of new money , it includes the £ 18.4m from october .
it 's all good publicity when mr andrew davies releases such large amounts of money , but since the last investment of £ 18.4m , we have n't seen a single broadband connection as a direct result - so do n't get your hopes up .
i truly hope that this time the government will stick their hands in their pockets and spend it wisely .
i would also call upon andrew davies to start spending this money asap .
darren powles , broadband for wales i assume the £ 100m spend will be funded from welsh taxpayers as the initiative is coming from the welsh assembly .
no taxation without representation -lrb- as someone once said in a similar situation -rrb- .
john bull , england the funding is excellent and the subsidies are superb for businesses .
but the problem in wales is that there is no demand .
businesses do n't know how to benefit from the internet and i do n't believe government organisations have a good understanding of that .
there needs to be an awareness campaign , or this announcement wo n't change the attitude of businesses in wales .
jeremy rollinson , ruraldsl campaign , powys broadband should be available to everyone .
the rest of the world have got it - why ca n't wales have it ?
come on the welsh office ; show bt what to do .
i am from merthyr tydfil - also disabled - and i would like broadband very much .
very disappointed with bt - with all our technology , why are we waiting ?
paul , wales , uk fantastic - now people in wales can have 24-hour access to pornograph , y too . £ 100m of government money well spent , i think .
frank , uk nice for wales , but i live in hertfordshire , 17 miles from london and there are ' no plans ' to upgrade our rural exchange .
satellite is too expensive , so who will subsidise adsl in rural hertfordshire ?
rod , england , uk excellent news for wales .
something like this is needed .
the demand may not be there now , but i 'm sure it will be by the time this has got off the ground .
now how about the rest of us ?
bt is n't even interested in whether or not people where i live want broadband .
how about scotland ?
the rural areas there need help too .
steve knight , devon this surely could be damaging for the already ailing employment situation in wales .
with dismissals at work for searching for porn on the rise , i can see that as the internet gets faster then dismissals for looking at lewd pictures at work can only increase ! !
alex , uk / russia the only way to get full national coverage is via satellite .
and it is both two-way -lrb- premium -rrb- and hybrid -lrb- less expensive -rrb- - which is what we told the welsh assembly in aug 2001 .
project just got sunk and mired for some reason .
shame really - only needed less than £ 3m to put dedicated welsh platform in place ...
rory , uk i myself am a young online gamer .
me and many of my friends all have to live with a nasty 56k connection which only connects at a max of 28.8k due to bt lowering the quality of our lines .
it is nearly impossible to play games on public servers because the ping becomes far to high and we get lots of lag .
the entire rhondda cynon taff area has a bad internet connection on conventional lines and it 's about time broadband is coming into our area .
we were promised adsl connections in 2000 but bt stopped its campagin .
if this one is never put forward , there will be a lot of angry welsh citizens !
luke geach , tonyrefail , wales i am from blackwood in gwent , where there are thousands of internet users .
bt do not consider it viable to include us in their roll-out , whereas abergavenny , a comparatively small town , gets broadband in september .
it seems that bt have cherry-picked the areas in which it will be easier to set up broadband .
will broadband wales have the same plans ?
i assume so .
bernie matthews , wales i would like to know how this money is likely to be spent .
will it be used to subsidise bt to provide xdsl services where exchanges are not curently enabled -lrb- taking note of the fact that xdsl is limited to 5km cable length from the exchange , so probably impractical for most of rural wales -rrb- , or will wales create it 's own broadband network , using technologies like wireless -lrb- 802.11b -rrb- and fibre -lrb- where i have heard of european grants availible for setup of this type of network -rrb- , to compete with our european neighbours , where 10mbps and 100mbps connections to homes are common-place ?
is this money just going to be indirectly pumped straight into the pockets of the bt shareholders ? !
peter sheppard , newport , wales , uk having recently moved to snowdonia whilst working in manchesster still - where , as a nurse , i have broadband at both home and work - i have to say that i would be glad of the ability to even receive a half decent tv picture .
broadband is fantastic , as anyone who uses it knows .
the enormity of difference between the levels of technological awareness between the two areas of my life is frightening .
this package and any accompanying drive to inform and integrate must also be applied to home users in rural wales , not only businesses , so that full exploitation of the possibilities of the internet can be realised by the next generation , not just the businessmen of today .
if not , then i fear many will be left so far behind that no discernable benefit will be gained .
it is by putting these tools into ordinary peoples hands that development and understanding and opportunity arises ... " let the children play " .

but the tourism industry , which contributes 12 % of spain 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , appears unaffected .

but ms henderson told bbc news online : " the kids were a bit apprehensive but it did n't put us off .
we looked at the bright side that if they had bombed here once they would not do it again in the same place . "
she said the bomb had gone off only yards from the apartment where they were staying , and the repair work had disrupted their supply of hot water .
" but that apart , it 's been a great holiday .
