once approved , the market scheme will give key industries permission to buy and sell emission rights within the european union from 2005 .
it will also set a limit on the amount of the ' greenhouse gases ' that the named industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - can produce .
the eu deal aims to cut greenhouse gas levels in line with the 1997 kyoto protocol .
it is the first inter-country agreement for corporate trading in co2 .
the german environmental minister jürgen tritten said that his government supported the eu scheme even though its emissions policy was already in line with the original reduction schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen tritten urges the member states to cut emissions .
" the other states need to reduce emissions for the kyoto protocol to be realised , " said trittin in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung .
polluters can buy credits from producers of less gas emissions trading involves countries buying and selling their agreed allowances of greenhouse gas emissions .
this allows highly polluting countries to buy unused ' credits ' from those which are allowed to emit more than they actually do .
it benefits both sides : the polluters gain by not having to reduce their own emissions while those countries who have less emissions have a handy source of revenue .
traders are already brokering speculative deals between companies around the world where co2 credits are changing hands for up to five euro -lrb- $ 5.06 -rrb- a ton .
the effect is a balanced rate of gas emission that acts as a cap for the amount that can be produced in the eu .
" it is good for the environment , it is good for enterprises and it is good for the economy ... the eu can really begin work on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases " danish environment minister hans christian schmidt told reporters after the meeting .
lower fines take the sting out of industry costs industry , especially in germany , has been skeptical of a policy it fears could just be an energy tax by a different name .
to reduce the cost to industry , the 15 environment ministers agreed a number of significantly lower fines to those already in place if emissions targets are not met .
penalties in the introductory period , from 2005 to 2007 , are 40 euro -lrb- $ 40.51 -rrb- per ton of co2 beyond the allowed limit , rising to 100 euro per ton from the start of 2008 .
trading is first step in reducing eu gas to kyoto level the year is in important one in terms of the protocol .
according to the international agreement , the eu as a whole must cut emissions of co2 and five other gases - methane , nitrous oxide , hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride - between 2008 and 2012 to eight percent below its 1990 levels .
the eu scheme could be the precursor of a global emissions trading market between all countries involved in kyoto .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough scientific evidence for bush .
the americans have excluded themselves from any future market dealing for the time being .
the united states , which produces a quarter of the world 's greenhouse gases , has abandoned the kyoto protocol , saying there is a lack of scientific evidence .
ironically , the majority of traders waiting to take advantage of the eu market are located in the united states , where emissions trading was first established to deal with pollutants like sulphur dioxide which causes acid rain .
without measures , eu would fall way below agreed cuts last week , the european environment agency -lrb- eea -rrb- predicted that the eu would miss its kyoto target if emissions trading and other measures were not introduced .
the eea reported that the latest projections provided by member states before the agreement was signed showed that their existing policies would achieve a total cut of only 4.7 percent by 2010 .
most of that decrease would be achieved by germany , sweden and the uk cutting their emissions by more than they need to .
if these countries decided not to " over-comply " , the eea stated that the eu 's overall emissions would decrease by a mere 0.6 percent by 2010 .

once approved , the market scheme will give key industries permission to buy and sell emission rights within the european union from 2005 .
it will also set a limit on the amount of the ' greenhouse gases ' that the named industries - energy , steel , cement , glass , brick making , paper and cardboard - can produce .
the eu deal aims to cut greenhouse gas levels in line with the 1997 kyoto protocol .
it is the first inter-country agreement for corporate trading in co2 .
the german environmental minister jürgen tritten said that his government supported the eu scheme even though its emissions policy was already in line with the original reduction schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen tritten urges the member states to cut emissions .
" the other states need to reduce emissions for the kyoto protocol to be realised , " said trittin in the german daily süddeutsche zeitung .
polluters can buy credits from producers of less gas emissions trading involves countries buying and selling their agreed allowances of greenhouse gas emissions .
this allows highly polluting countries to buy unused ' credits ' from those which are allowed to emit more than they actually do .
it benefits both sides : the polluters gain by not having to reduce their own emissions while those countries who have less emissions have a handy source of revenue .
traders are already brokering speculative deals between companies around the world where co2 credits are changing hands for up to five euro -lrb- $ 5.06 -rrb- a ton .
the effect is a balanced rate of gas emission that acts as a cap for the amount that can be produced in the eu .
" it is good for the environment , it is good for enterprises and it is good for the economy ... the eu can really begin work on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases " danish environment minister hans christian schmidt told reporters after the meeting .
lower fines take the sting out of industry costs industry , especially in germany , has been skeptical of a policy it fears could just be an energy tax by a different name .
to reduce the cost to industry , the 15 environment ministers agreed a number of significantly lower fines to those already in place if emissions targets are not met .
penalties in the introductory period , from 2005 to 2007 , are 40 euro -lrb- $ 40.51 -rrb- per ton of co2 beyond the allowed limit , rising to 100 euro per ton from the start of 2008 .
trading is first step in reducing eu gas to kyoto level the year is in important one in terms of the protocol .
according to the international agreement , the eu as a whole must cut emissions of co2 and five other gases - methane , nitrous oxide , hydrofluorocarbons , perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride - between 2008 and 2012 to eight percent below its 1990 levels .
the eu scheme could be the precursor of a global emissions trading market between all countries involved in kyoto .

the retailer will restate its financial figures to give a true picture of the size of its losses since april 1999 .
kmart has estimated that its losses during the period were $ 200m -lrb- £ 127m -rrb- greater than it had reported , bringing the total to $ 4bn rather than $ 3.8bn as its now defunct accounts suggest .
about half the additional losses were incurred during the april to september period this year , bringing the losses for this period to $ 1.9bn.
during the previous three financial years , kmart 's losses reached $ 2.1bn when the latest revelations are taken into account .
faulty software kmart 's problems were uncovered when the company reviewed its accounting practices .
the company blamed an error in its accounting software and the failure to set aside sufficient sums to cover rent expenses .
the computer program was written during the late 1980s , kmart said .
" we do not expect this restatement to affect our ability to conduct business , " said the company 's chief financial officer , al koch .
" it 's not material to their results .
it 's a matter of shifting some numbers around , " said morningstar retail stock analyst mike porter .

in a bbc newsnight scotland interview , the scottish parliament 's presiding officer said it was unhealthy to have " political monocultures " .
the labour party , especially in the west of scotland , has controlled some council chambers for decades without challenge .
sir david , a lothians msp , said that as an east of scotland politician he had watched the mono-party culture in the west of the country with dismay .

he said : " you have got four parties of size and two smaller ones as well , and i think multi-partyism is a good thing .
party loyalty " i think people should have wider choices and the kind of mono-culture in politics is never healthy . "
in a wide-ranging interview , sir david also suggested that msps were too loyal to their respective parties .
" i think you will find , as we get into the second parliament , that there will be a greater independence on the backbenches , " sir david said .
" i think everyone was pretty nervous about coming into the new institution .
' burning injustice ' " there has , maybe , been an excessive outbreak of loyalty among the backbenchers rather than they are there to a job independent of the executive . "
he also accused politicians of failing to tackle what he called the " burning injustice " of inequality with conviction .
he said : " the underclass developing in scotland is really not being tackled with sufficient determination and motivation by the political class .
" speeches are made about it and so on but i think there is a really burning injustice in our society which we are tending to ignore . "
sir david said he was impressed with the standards of debate in the parliament , though he would like to see a more diverse intake of msps in the next term .

now the government has come to the rescue with plans to widen the a303 into a dual carriageway .
the plans will relieve the notorious bottle-necks along the main road from the m3 to the m5 .
honiton-based sheer speed , which makes shelters for workmen , has been considering moving to another part of the country because transport links are so poor . "
business margins are being squeezed " federation of small businesses they make more than 1,000 shelters a year and many of them go to london and the south east .
they are also wanted at very short notice , so transport is an important issue .
this year turnover has trebled , but the state of the a303 is making them wonder if they should ship out .
stainton reid of sheer speed , said : " we are considering whether we should move as a consequence of the bottle-neck that we have here .
' margins squeezed ' " it would give us greater freedom of movement and ease of supply .
" if we were able to feel more settled in terms of efficiencies of transport in and out , then we might stay here . "
business leaders in the south west have been saying for many years that improving transport in and out of the region should be one of the government 's top priorities .
the aim of dualling the a303 is to provide a good alternative to the m4 and m5 .
rupert cox , regional organiser of the federation of small businesses , said : " as soon as you increase transport time , you increase costs to businesses , so competitiveness goes out of the window .
" in the summer months especially , the road is at its worst - and business margins are being squeezed . "
farmer anthony bond from aplins farm near honiton , remembers when the first proposals for dualling the a303 were made - in the 1950s .

now the government has come to the rescue with plans to widen the a303 into a dual carriageway .
the plans will relieve the notorious bottle-necks along the main road from the m3 to the m5 .
honiton-based sheer speed , which makes shelters for workmen , has been considering moving to another part of the country because transport links are so poor .
business margins are being squeezed federation of small businesses they make more than 1,000 shelters a year and many of them go to london and the south east .
they are also wanted at very short notice , so transport is an important issue .
this year turnover has trebled , but the state of the a303 is making them wonder if they should ship out .
stainton reid of sheer speed , said : " we are considering whether we should move as a consequence of the bottle-neck that we have here .
' margins squeezed ' " it would give us greater freedom of movement and ease of supply .
" if we were able to feel more settled in terms of efficiencies of transport in and out , then we might stay here . "
anthony bond : time for action business leaders in the south west have been saying for many years that improving transport in and out of the region should be one of the government 's top priorities .
the aim of dualling the a303 is to provide a good alternative to the m4 and m5 .
rupert cox , regional organiser of the federation of small businesses , said : " as soon as you increase transport time , you increase costs to businesses , so competitiveness goes out of the window .
" in the summer months especially , the road is at its worst - and business margins are being squeezed . "
farmer anthony bond from aplins farm near honiton , remembers when the first proposals for dualling the a303 were made - in the 1950s .
he said : " they have been doing surveys every 10 years .
the traffic is getting a lot heavier and i think it is about time they did something . "

argentina 's economic strategy of bolstering its currency , the peso , should remain largely unchanged when alfonso prat gay takes over from aldo pignanelli .
mr pignanelli 's resignation came soon after the economy minister roberto lavagna overruled his objections and opted to default on an $ 805m -lrb- £ 509m -rrb- debt repayment to the world bank .
more than half the country 's 36 million people are living in poverty , and hunger has become a serious problem .
against that background , argentina informed the bank that it could not meet its obligations and made only an interest payment of $ 79.2m.
feuds over ?
following the recent power struggle between the central bank and the economy ministry over monetary policy and foreign debt repayments , few would expect mr prat gay to gain the upper hand .
in fact , it has emerged that mr prat gay 's selection was favoured by mr lavagna , and as such tensions between the central bank and his ministry might ease .
" obviously , -lsb- mr pignanelli 's resignation -rsb- is not a good thing , but neither could one continue with the feuds with the economy minister , " said dario lewkowicz , a trader at exprinter administradora .
" i 'd say it is the lesser of two evils .
" it would have been a lot worse if the economy minister had gone . "
short-term career mr prat gay was recruited from his teaching post at a university in buenos aires .
before his return to argentina last year , he worked for jp morgan in london .
the peso rose slightly following his appointment as the markets cheered the selection from their own ranks .
but , taking recent history into account , mr prat gay should not consider his appointment a long-term career .
turbulence at the top is common in argentina where mr prat gay will be the fifth central bank governor in just over a year .
argentina has also seen six economy ministers and five presidents during the last year .
argentina faces a fresh deadline this weekend to make a repayment on its debt to the world bank .
failure to do so could bring down the full wrath of the bank which might freeze argentina 's existing loans .

offending cars can now be photographed before being issued with a ticket - making it harder for drivers to claim they had done nothing wrong .
traffic manager peter dove said : " tickets are often disputed and these cameras will certainly help us by confirming one way or another whether an offence has occurred . "
the new equipment has also been welcomed by traffic wardens in the town .
" we have observed people removing these tickets , particularly in disabled bays in the evenings , and placing them on adjacent vehicles and driving off , " said peter cox .
" they 're helping us immensely with people that are parking out of bays , people who are taking up two bays - we 've got the evidence . "
