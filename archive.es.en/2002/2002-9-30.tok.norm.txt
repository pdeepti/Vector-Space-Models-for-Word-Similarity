both the united states and the united kingdom are lobbying hard to win the council 's support for a new toughly worded us draft resolution requiring baghdad to fully comply with new arms inspection rules within 30 days or face military action .
the new resolution is expected to propose a radical change to the inspections regime in iraq , including tight deadlines , stringent inspection rules and the possible inclusion of armed guards on inspection teams .
france unlikely to endorse new resolution in an attempt to persuade france , russia and china - those permanent council members still reluctant to sign the resolution - britain has sent an envoy to beijing , while the us is likely to try and persuade france and russia to back the resolution .
both france and russia , like china , hold vetoes on the security council .
but chances of persuading the three permanent members appear slim .
france reaffirmed its opposition to the us-sponsored security council resolution : " we do not want to give carte blanche to military action because we want to fully accept our responsibilities , " foreign minister dominique de villepin told the newspaper le monde .
" that is why we can not accept a resolution authorising as of now the recourse to force without coming back to the u.n. security council , " he said in an interview , released ahead of scheduled publication in tuesday ’ s edition .
russia and china remain sceptical on saturday , russian foreign minister igor ivanov said un inspectors should return to iraq " as quickly as possible " .
he rejected the need for a new resolution , saying " the necessary conditions " for their return were already in place .
but russia would " look carefully " at the views of other security council members , he added .
beijing has adopted a similar line .
on friday , chinese premier zhu rongji said after meeting with french prime minister jean-pierre rafarrin , " if the weapons inspections do not take place , if we do not have clear proof and if we do not have the authorisation of the security council , we can not launch a military attack on iraq - otherwise there would be incalculable consequences , " he said .
europe still far removed from common policy on iraq meanwhile europe ’ s lack of a unified stance on iraq and transatlantic tensions will be in the spotlight at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday .
caught between british premier tony blair ’ s outspoken support for a us-led strike and german chancellor schröder ’ s blunt rejection of the use of force , the remaining 13 eu nations have been dithering in committing themselves to any concrete decision regarding iraq .
" iraq always has been , and perhaps always will be , the achilles ' heel of eu foreign policy , " said charles grant , director of the centre for european reform in a research paper .
" on almost every issue of importance – such as the balkans , russia , china , iran and even israel-palestine – the europeans have developed either a common policy or at least a fairly common perspective .
but not on iraq . "
no to war against iraq but while leaders of the european union ’ s 15 members states continued with intense debate on the issue of iraq , a large chunk of the eu ’ s population was vocal in what they thought about the issue over the weekend .
massive anti-war demonstrations took place in london and rome as ten of thousands of flag-waving and whistle-blowing peaceniks took to the streets .
in rome , a rally organised by the hard left communist refoundation party in the city 's ancient heart , attracted an estimated 50,000 and 100,000 demonstrators , who accused bush of war-mongering .
" an eye for an eye will leave the world blind , " sang one group of activists .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said last week that rome had a duty to support us diplomatic and military efforts to disarm iraq .
but latest opinion polls suggest that almost 70 percent of italians are against the idea of going to war with iraq .
anti-war sentiment was echoed in london over the weekend as some 150,000 britons flocked to a vast peace rally waving anti-war banners and chanting slogans against " bomber bush and bomber blair " .
polls show that most of britain ’ s 60 million people would oppose their nation joining a purely us-led attempt to topple saddam hussein .
but two-thirds would be in favour if the united nations approves such action , according to recent surveys . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

both the united states and the united kingdom are lobbying hard to win the council 's support for a new toughly worded us draft resolution requiring baghdad to fully comply with new arms inspection rules within 30 days or face military action .
the new resolution is expected to propose a radical change to the inspections regime in iraq , including tight deadlines , stringent inspection rules and the possible inclusion of armed guards on inspection teams .
france unlikely to endorse new resolution in an attempt to persuade france , russia and china - those permanent council members still reluctant to sign the resolution - britain has sent an envoy to beijing , while the us is likely to try and persuade france and russia to back the resolution .
both france and russia , like china , hold vetoes on the security council .
but chances of persuading the three permanent members appear slim .
france reaffirmed its opposition to the us-sponsored security council resolution : " we do not want to give carte blanche to military action because we want to fully accept our responsibilities , " foreign minister dominique de villepin told the newspaper le monde .
" that is why we can not accept a resolution authorising as of now the recourse to force without coming back to the u.n. security council , " he said in an interview , released ahead of scheduled publication in tuesday ’ s edition .
russia and china remain sceptical on saturday , russian foreign minister igor ivanov said un inspectors should return to iraq " as quickly as possible " .
he rejected the need for a new resolution , saying " the necessary conditions " for their return were already in place .
but russia would " look carefully " at the views of other security council members , he added .
beijing has adopted a similar line .
on friday , chinese premier zhu rongji said after meeting with french prime minister jean-pierre rafarrin , " if the weapons inspections do not take place , if we do not have clear proof and if we do not have the authorisation of the security council , we can not launch a military attack on iraq - otherwise there would be incalculable consequences , " he said .
europe still far removed from common policy on iraq meanwhile europe ’ s lack of a unified stance on iraq and transatlantic tensions will be in the spotlight at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday .
caught between british premier tony blair ’ s outspoken support for a us-led strike and german chancellor schröder ’ s blunt rejection of the use of force , the remaining 13 eu nations have been dithering in committing themselves to any concrete decision regarding iraq .
" iraq always has been , and perhaps always will be , the achilles ' heel of eu foreign policy , " said charles grant , director of the centre for european reform in a research paper .
" on almost every issue of importance – such as the balkans , russia , china , iran and even israel-palestine – the europeans have developed either a common policy or at least a fairly common perspective .
but not on iraq . "
no to war against iraq but while leaders of the european union ’ s 15 members states continued with intense debate on the issue of iraq , a large chunk of the eu ’ s population was vocal in what they thought about the issue over the weekend .
massive anti-war demonstrations took place in london and rome as ten of thousands of flag-waving and whistle-blowing peaceniks took to the streets .
in rome , a rally organised by the hard left communist refoundation party in the city 's ancient heart , attracted an estimated 50,000 and 100,000 demonstrators , who accused bush of war-mongering .
" an eye for an eye will leave the world blind , " sang one group of activists .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said last week that rome had a duty to support us diplomatic and military efforts to disarm iraq .
but latest opinion polls suggest that almost 70 percent of italians are against the idea of going to war with iraq .
anti-war sentiment was echoed in london over the weekend as some 150,000 britons flocked to a vast peace rally waving anti-war banners and chanting slogans against " bomber bush and bomber blair " .
polls show that most of britain ’ s 60 million people would oppose their nation joining a purely us-led attempt to topple saddam hussein .
but two-thirds would be in favour if the united nations approves such action , according to recent surveys . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

both the united states and the united kingdom are lobbying hard to win the council 's support for a new toughly worded us draft resolution requiring baghdad to fully comply with new arms inspection rules within 30 days or face military action .
the new resolution is expected to propose a radical change to the inspections regime in iraq , including tight deadlines , stringent inspection rules and the possible inclusion of armed guards on inspection teams .
france unlikely to endorse new resolution in an attempt to persuade france , russia and china - those permanent council members still reluctant to sign the resolution - britain has sent an envoy to beijing , while the us is likely to try and persuade france and russia to back the resolution .
both france and russia , like china , hold vetoes on the security council .
but chances of persuading the three permanent members appear slim .
france reaffirmed its opposition to the us-sponsored security council resolution : " we do not want to give carte blanche to military action because we want to fully accept our responsibilities , " foreign minister dominique de villepin told the newspaper le monde .
" that is why we can not accept a resolution authorising as of now the recourse to force without coming back to the u.n. security council , " he said in an interview , released ahead of scheduled publication in tuesday ’ s edition .
russia and china remain sceptical on saturday , russian foreign minister igor ivanov said un inspectors should return to iraq " as quickly as possible " .
he rejected the need for a new resolution , saying " the necessary conditions " for their return were already in place .
but russia would " look carefully " at the views of other security council members , he added .
beijing has adopted a similar line .
on friday , chinese premier zhu rongji said after meeting with french prime minister jean-pierre rafarrin , " if the weapons inspections do not take place , if we do not have clear proof and if we do not have the authorisation of the security council , we can not launch a military attack on iraq - otherwise there would be incalculable consequences , " he said .
europe still far removed from common policy on iraq meanwhile europe ’ s lack of a unified stance on iraq and transatlantic tensions will be in the spotlight at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday .
caught between british premier tony blair ’ s outspoken support for a us-led strike and german chancellor schröder ’ s blunt rejection of the use of force , the remaining 13 eu nations have been dithering in committing themselves to any concrete decision regarding iraq .
" iraq always has been , and perhaps always will be , the achilles ' heel of eu foreign policy , " said charles grant , director of the centre for european reform in a research paper .
" on almost every issue of importance – such as the balkans , russia , china , iran and even israel-palestine – the europeans have developed either a common policy or at least a fairly common perspective .
but not on iraq . "
no to war against iraq but while leaders of the european union ’ s 15 members states continued with intense debate on the issue of iraq , a large chunk of the eu ’ s population was vocal in what they thought about the issue over the weekend .
massive anti-war demonstrations took place in london and rome as ten of thousands of flag-waving and whistle-blowing peaceniks took to the streets .
in rome , a rally organised by the hard left communist refoundation party in the city 's ancient heart , attracted an estimated 50,000 and 100,000 demonstrators , who accused bush of war-mongering .
" an eye for an eye will leave the world blind , " sang one group of activists .

no to war against iraq but while leaders of the european union ’ s 15 members states continued with intense debate on the issue of iraq , a large chunk of the eu ’ s population was vocal in what they thought about the issue over the weekend .
massive anti-war demonstrations took place in london and rome as ten of thousands of flag-waving and whistle-blowing peaceniks took to the streets .
in rome , a rally organised by the hard left communist refoundation party in the city 's ancient heart , attracted an estimated 50,000 and 100,000 demonstrators , who accused bush of war-mongering .
" an eye for an eye will leave the world blind , " sang one group of activists .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said last week that rome had a duty to support us diplomatic and military efforts to disarm iraq .
but latest opinion polls suggest that almost 70 percent of italians are against the idea of going to war with iraq .
anti-war sentiment was echoed in london over the weekend as some 150,000 britons flocked to a vast peace rally waving anti-war banners and chanting slogans against " bomber bush and bomber blair " .

both the united states and the united kingdom are lobbying hard to win the council 's support for a new toughly worded us draft resolution requiring baghdad to fully comply with new arms inspection rules within 30 days or face military action .
the new resolution is expected to propose a radical change to the inspections regime in iraq , including tight deadlines , stringent inspection rules and the possible inclusion of armed guards on inspection teams .
france unlikely to endorse new resolution in an attempt to persuade france , russia and china - those permanent council members still reluctant to sign the resolution - britain has sent an envoy to beijing , while the us is likely to try and persuade france and russia to back the resolution .
both france and russia , like china , hold vetoes on the security council .
but chances of persuading the three permanent members appear slim .
france reaffirmed its opposition to the us-sponsored security council resolution : " we do not want to give carte blanche to military action because we want to fully accept our responsibilities , " foreign minister dominique de villepin told the newspaper le monde .
" that is why we can not accept a resolution authorising as of now the recourse to force without coming back to the u.n. security council , " he said in an interview , released ahead of scheduled publication in tuesday ’ s edition .
russia and china remain sceptical on saturday , russian foreign minister igor ivanov said un inspectors should return to iraq " as quickly as possible " .
he rejected the need for a new resolution , saying " the necessary conditions " for their return were already in place .
but russia would " look carefully " at the views of other security council members , he added .
beijing has adopted a similar line .
on friday , chinese premier zhu rongji said after meeting with french prime minister jean-pierre rafarrin , " if the weapons inspections do not take place , if we do not have clear proof and if we do not have the authorisation of the security council , we can not launch a military attack on iraq - otherwise there would be incalculable consequences , " he said .
europe still far removed from common policy on iraq meanwhile europe ’ s lack of a unified stance on iraq and transatlantic tensions will be in the spotlight at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday .

he rejected the need for a new resolution , saying " the necessary conditions " for their return were already in place .
but russia would " look carefully " at the views of other security council members , he added .
beijing has adopted a similar line .
on friday , chinese premier zhu rongji said after meeting with french prime minister jean-pierre rafarrin , " if the weapons inspections do not take place , if we do not have clear proof and if we do not have the authorisation of the security council , we can not launch a military attack on iraq - otherwise there would be incalculable consequences , " he said .
europe still far removed from common policy on iraq meanwhile europe ’ s lack of a unified stance on iraq and transatlantic tensions will be in the spotlight at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday .
caught between british premier tony blair ’ s outspoken support for a us-led strike and german chancellor schröder ’ s blunt rejection of the use of force , the remaining 13 eu nations have been dithering in committing themselves to any concrete decision regarding iraq .
" iraq always has been , and perhaps always will be , the achilles ' heel of eu foreign policy , " said charles grant , director of the centre for european reform in a research paper .
" on almost every issue of importance – such as the balkans , russia , china , iran and even israel-palestine – the europeans have developed either a common policy or at least a fairly common perspective .
but not on iraq . "
no to war against iraq but while leaders of the european union ’ s 15 members states continued with intense debate on the issue of iraq , a large chunk of the eu ’ s population was vocal in what they thought about the issue over the weekend .
massive anti-war demonstrations took place in london and rome as ten of thousands of flag-waving and whistle-blowing peaceniks took to the streets .
in rome , a rally organised by the hard left communist refoundation party in the city 's ancient heart , attracted an estimated 50,000 and 100,000 demonstrators , who accused bush of war-mongering .
" an eye for an eye will leave the world blind , " sang one group of activists .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said last week that rome had a duty to support us diplomatic and military efforts to disarm iraq .
but latest opinion polls suggest that almost 70 percent of italians are against the idea of going to war with iraq .
anti-war sentiment was echoed in london over the weekend as some 150,000 britons flocked to a vast peace rally waving anti-war banners and chanting slogans against " bomber bush and bomber blair " .

both the united states and the united kingdom are lobbying hard to win the council 's support for a new toughly worded us draft resolution requiring baghdad to fully comply with new arms inspection rules within 30 days or face military action .
the new resolution is expected to propose a radical change to the inspections regime in iraq , including tight deadlines , stringent inspection rules and the possible inclusion of armed guards on inspection teams .
france unlikely to endorse new resolution in an attempt to persuade france , russia and china - those permanent council members still reluctant to sign the resolution - britain has sent an envoy to beijing , while the us is likely to try and persuade france and russia to back the resolution .
both france and russia , like china , hold vetoes on the security council .
but chances of persuading the three permanent members appear slim .
france reaffirmed its opposition to the us-sponsored security council resolution : " we do not want to give carte blanche to military action because we want to fully accept our responsibilities , " foreign minister dominique de villepin told the newspaper le monde .

both the united states and the united kingdom are lobbying hard to win the council 's support for a new toughly worded us draft resolution requiring baghdad to fully comply with new arms inspection rules within 30 days or face military action .
the new resolution is expected to propose a radical change to the inspections regime in iraq , including tight deadlines , stringent inspection rules and the possible inclusion of armed guards on inspection teams .
france unlikely to endorse new resolution in an attempt to persuade france , russia and china - those permanent council members still reluctant to sign the resolution - britain has sent an envoy to beijing , while the us is likely to try and persuade france and russia to back the resolution .
both france and russia , like china , hold vetoes on the security council .
but chances of persuading the three permanent members appear slim .
france reaffirmed its opposition to the us-sponsored security council resolution : " we do not want to give carte blanche to military action because we want to fully accept our responsibilities , " foreign minister dominique de villepin told the newspaper le monde .
" that is why we can not accept a resolution authorising as of now the recourse to force without coming back to the u.n. security council , " he said in an interview , released ahead of scheduled publication in tuesday ’ s edition .
russia and china remain sceptical on saturday , russian foreign minister igor ivanov said un inspectors should return to iraq " as quickly as possible " .
he rejected the need for a new resolution , saying " the necessary conditions " for their return were already in place .
but russia would " look carefully " at the views of other security council members , he added .
beijing has adopted a similar line .
on friday , chinese premier zhu rongji said after meeting with french prime minister jean-pierre rafarrin , " if the weapons inspections do not take place , if we do not have clear proof and if we do not have the authorisation of the security council , we can not launch a military attack on iraq - otherwise there would be incalculable consequences , " he said .
europe still far removed from common policy on iraq meanwhile europe ’ s lack of a unified stance on iraq and transatlantic tensions will be in the spotlight at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday .
caught between british premier tony blair ’ s outspoken support for a us-led strike and german chancellor schröder ’ s blunt rejection of the use of force , the remaining 13 eu nations have been dithering in committing themselves to any concrete decision regarding iraq .
" iraq always has been , and perhaps always will be , the achilles ' heel of eu foreign policy , " said charles grant , director of the centre for european reform in a research paper .
" on almost every issue of importance – such as the balkans , russia , china , iran and even israel-palestine – the europeans have developed either a common policy or at least a fairly common perspective .
but not on iraq . "
no to war against iraq but while leaders of the european union ’ s 15 members states continued with intense debate on the issue of iraq , a large chunk of the eu ’ s population was vocal in what they thought about the issue over the weekend .
massive anti-war demonstrations took place in london and rome as ten of thousands of flag-waving and whistle-blowing peaceniks took to the streets .
in rome , a rally organised by the hard left communist refoundation party in the city 's ancient heart , attracted an estimated 50,000 and 100,000 demonstrators , who accused bush of war-mongering .
" an eye for an eye will leave the world blind , " sang one group of activists .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said last week that rome had a duty to support us diplomatic and military efforts to disarm iraq .
but latest opinion polls suggest that almost 70 percent of italians are against the idea of going to war with iraq .
anti-war sentiment was echoed in london over the weekend as some 150,000 britons flocked to a vast peace rally waving anti-war banners and chanting slogans against " bomber bush and bomber blair " .
polls show that most of britain ’ s 60 million people would oppose their nation joining a purely us-led attempt to topple saddam hussein .
but two-thirds would be in favour if the united nations approves such action , according to recent surveys . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

both the united states and the united kingdom are lobbying hard to win the council 's support for a new toughly worded us draft resolution requiring baghdad to fully comply with new arms inspection rules within 30 days or face military action .
the new resolution is expected to propose a radical change to the inspections regime in iraq , including tight deadlines , stringent inspection rules and the possible inclusion of armed guards on inspection teams .
france unlikely to endorse new resolution in an attempt to persuade france , russia and china - those permanent council members still reluctant to sign the resolution - britain has sent an envoy to beijing , while the us is likely to try and persuade france and russia to back the resolution .
both france and russia , like china , hold vetoes on the security council .
but chances of persuading the three permanent members appear slim .
france reaffirmed its opposition to the us-sponsored security council resolution : " we do not want to give carte blanche to military action because we want to fully accept our responsibilities , " foreign minister dominique de villepin told the newspaper le monde .
" that is why we can not accept a resolution authorising as of now the recourse to force without coming back to the u.n. security council , " he said in an interview , released ahead of scheduled publication in tuesday ’ s edition .
russia and china remain sceptical on saturday , russian foreign minister igor ivanov said un inspectors should return to iraq " as quickly as possible " .
he rejected the need for a new resolution , saying " the necessary conditions " for their return were already in place .
but russia would " look carefully " at the views of other security council members , he added .
beijing has adopted a similar line .
on friday , chinese premier zhu rongji said after meeting with french prime minister jean-pierre rafarrin , " if the weapons inspections do not take place , if we do not have clear proof and if we do not have the authorisation of the security council , we can not launch a military attack on iraq - otherwise there would be incalculable consequences , " he said .
europe still far removed from common policy on iraq meanwhile europe ’ s lack of a unified stance on iraq and transatlantic tensions will be in the spotlight at a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday .
caught between british premier tony blair ’ s outspoken support for a us-led strike and german chancellor schröder ’ s blunt rejection of the use of force , the remaining 13 eu nations have been dithering in committing themselves to any concrete decision regarding iraq .
" iraq always has been , and perhaps always will be , the achilles ' heel of eu foreign policy , " said charles grant , director of the centre for european reform in a research paper .
" on almost every issue of importance – such as the balkans , russia , china , iran and even israel-palestine – the europeans have developed either a common policy or at least a fairly common perspective .
but not on iraq . "
no to war against iraq but while leaders of the european union ’ s 15 members states continued with intense debate on the issue of iraq , a large chunk of the eu ’ s population was vocal in what they thought about the issue over the weekend .
massive anti-war demonstrations took place in london and rome as ten of thousands of flag-waving and whistle-blowing peaceniks took to the streets .
in rome , a rally organised by the hard left communist refoundation party in the city 's ancient heart , attracted an estimated 50,000 and 100,000 demonstrators , who accused bush of war-mongering .
" an eye for an eye will leave the world blind , " sang one group of activists .
italian prime minister silvio berlusconi said last week that rome had a duty to support us diplomatic and military efforts to disarm iraq .
but latest opinion polls suggest that almost 70 percent of italians are against the idea of going to war with iraq .
anti-war sentiment was echoed in london over the weekend as some 150,000 britons flocked to a vast peace rally waving anti-war banners and chanting slogans against " bomber bush and bomber blair " .

the " modernised " scheme will cover those whose tenancy begins from monday onwards .
the length of time a person will have to live in a property before they can buy it is extended from two year to five years .
the maximum discount on the purchase of a tenant 's home will be halved to 35 % or £ 15,000 , whichever is the lower figure .
we are calling for the scottish executive to make adequate money and resources available to ensure homeless and badly housed people reap the rewards from the new laws gavin corbett shelter scotland housing associations have also been given up to 10 years ' exemption from the right to buy .
however , this will not affect housing association tenants who have an existing right to buy their home .
social justice minister margaret curran said the move " restores the balance between those wishing to buy and those wishing to rent " .
it is only one of the provisions in the 2001 housing -lrb- scotland -rrb- act , which takes effect from monday .
ms curran described it as " one of the most significant pieces of housing legislation in scotland for a generation " .
consult tenants she said : " the provisions which are coming into force today will make a real difference to the lives of tenants throughout scotland by better balancing their rights and bringing council and housing association tenants under the same tenancy agreement .
" they will also ensure that landlords consult their tenants on decisions affecting them , " she said .
more than 700,000 housing association tenants will now have the same tenancy agreement as those living in council housing under the scottish secure tenancy -lrb- sst -rrb- .
margaret curran : " make a real difference " in addition to improved rights on joint tenancies and succession , it means that registered social landlords must provide compelling evidence to obtain a court eviction order .
councils are also given a duty to offer accommodation , whether permanent or temporary , to all homeless people , while putting the needs of children at the forefront .
scottish national party social justice spokesman kenny gibson said his party welcomed the increased role for housing associations in providing accommodation for homeless people .
" one of our concerns is that since new labour came to power , resources to public sector housing have declined by 30 % , " he said .
" while we can impose duties on organisations , adequate resources must be provided to ensure the legislation achieves its aims - one of which must be to reverse the decline in decent , affordable , public housing across scotland . "
new rights shelter scotland 's head of campaigns , gavin corbett , said : " we are calling for the scottish executive to make adequate money and resources available to ensure homeless and badly housed people reap the rewards from the new laws . "
the organisation has launched a programme to ensure that the homeless are aware of their new rights .
nick fletcher , policy officer for the chartered institute for housing in scotland , said the new sst would end confusion over tenancy rights in the social rented sector .

"
i decided to reshuffle the cabinet in order to speed up reforms " prime minister junichiro koizumi financial services minister hakuo yanagisawa 's departure was widely predicted by newspapers over the weekend .
he was well known to oppose the idea that the government should use public money to bail out japan 's hard-pressed banking sector .
with his ejection from the cabinet , the way now looks clear for the bank of japan to go ahead with a controversial plan to buy shares held by the banks .
his job at the head of the financial services agency will be taken by heizo takenaka , who keeps his existing role as head of economic and fiscal policy .
the finance minister , masajuro shiokawa , is also staying in his current post .
chief cabinet secretary yasuo fukuda quoted mr koizumi as saying : " i decided to reshuffle the cabinet in order to speed up reforms , based on a strengthening of the three-party ruling coalition . "
in debt ahead of the decision the financial markets were nervous , with investors selling banking stocks in particular in case the reshuffle does not produce the kind of urgency which the sector badly needs .
even afterwards , shares in tokyo picked up only slightly , with the benchmark nikkei 225 index finishing down 1.5 % .
the bank bailouts mr yanagisawa was so firmly opposed to are designed to help the banks deal with their massive shareholdings in companies to which they have loaned trillions of yen .
the holdings are now plummeting in value , and - with the huge mountain of bad debts - put the banks at risk of breaching rules which dictate how big their reserves must be .
and that has knock-on effects for the rest of the japanese economy .
deflation - falling prices - has been ravaging the country for years , and the chances of increased demand to help inject new life into the economy are rock-bottom as long as the banks are too fragile to lend .
on the up ?
mr koizumi 's decision to ditch his financial services minister could help him reclaim the popularity with which he started his term early in 2001 .
his approval ratings have soared to around 70 % in the wake of an unprecedented summit in north korea early in september .
that was the level they sustained for most of the first year of his premiership , thanks to his image as as a new broom sweeping away the policy paralysis gripping the long-ruling liberal democratic party .
but that impression died away earlier this year after a series of cabinet upsets and policy reversals which left him looking more like his faceless predecessors .

but that impression died away earlier this year after a series of cabinet upsets and policy reversals which left him looking more like his faceless predecessors . watch / listen on this story harauya ida , thomson ifr tokyo " it will allow funds to be more easily injected into the banking sector " see also : 27 sep 02 -pipe- business japan pm to reshape cabinet 09 aug 02 -pipe- asia-pacific japan 's tanaka quits parliament 02 aug 02 -pipe- business koizumi backs away from reform 30 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific japan 's pm survives no-confidence vote 03 jul 02 -pipe- asia-pacific koizumi compromises on reform 23 apr 02 -pipe- asia-pacific koizumi , one year on internet links : japan 's ministry of foreign affairs the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top business stories now : hacker breaches credit card security job losses escalate at reuters new sec chief pledges tough line oil prices push higher rwanda denies drc plundering overseas sales drive wal-mart congo 's finance minister resigns blair keeps euro options open links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

at the 2001 general election , tony blair made it clear that labour was committed to improving and reforming the public services .
but he has also made it clear that no union " wreckers " would be allowed to stand in the way of his reform plans , and that the huge increases in public spending would have to be accompanied by a transformation of the public sector to a world-class service .
the pfi is one of the key policies in that transformation , and that is why union attacks on its viability have received such a vigorous response .
mortgaging the future ?
the pfi is designed to make capital projects - the building of roads , hospitals and schools - more efficient by giving the private sector a larger role in running them .
private companies bid to build and run , for example , a hospital , for 30 years , in return for a fixed monthly payment from the government .
in return , they must borrow the money from a bank , who charges them interest .
it is not dissimilar to buying a house with a mortgage - but the government also requires the company to maintain that house to a good standard .
in the past , the government borrowed the money itself - at a slightly cheaper rate - and paid the private contractors in full for the building when it was finished .
but many public projects were finished late and well over budget .
the idea of the pfi is to give private sector an incentive to build on time and to quality , by giving them responsibility for future maintenance .
in addition , it is hoped that the private sector might be able to organise the workforce carrying out the maintenance more efficiently , thus saving money for the public purse .
union fears the unions are worried by several elements in this scheme .
they believe that the private sector makes too much money from the schemes at public expense .
they are worried that private companies will create a " two-tier " workforce .
workers who transfer to the private sector initially have their terms and conditions protected , but new workers only have to receive " broadly comparable " conditions , and usually get inferior pensions , for example .
and they are worried that the schemes are not good value for money , because the public sector could borrow the money cheaper to do the job itself .
what the public wants the government , however , argues that the public does n't care how projects are financed as long as they get built .
and it says that pfi is delivering many more hospitals and schools than would be possible under public spending constraints .
but the pfi does not represent " free money " and a way of avoiding public spending .
ultimately , it is also funded from the public purse , but over 30 years .
in the initial phase , more hospitals and schools are being built , but in the long-term , the cost of paying for them mounts up , reducing the potential public spending available to future chancellors .
whether it represents value for money depends on many things , including how efficient the private sector turns out to be in running school and hospital plant and equipment , and whether we are still in a low-inflation environment in 30 years .
and it is even questionable whether more hospitals and schools are being built yet .
both the private sector itself , and commentators like the institute for fiscal studies , believe that the long delays in the bidding process for pfi are one of the key reasons why the level of public spending on investment - which hit a record low in 1999 - has still not risen as much as the government would like .
bigger argument behind the argument about whether pfi is a good idea is a broader debate .
it is about the new boundaries that the government wants to draw between the public and private sectors .
tony blair 's ambition , in his critics ' eyes , is to revise the post-war settlement which created comprehensive schools and the national health service , in favour of a two-tier system of specialist secondary schools and the new " foundation trust " hospitals .
in their view , giving these schools and hospitals more freedom in the guise of efficiency and reform would in effect be a return to the era of grammar schools and private voluntary teaching hospitals - where a minority of the population obtained access to decent education and health care , whiled the majority was left behind in secondary moderns or local authority hospitals .
it is by no means clear where the government stands on this broader issue .
indeed the fierce disagreement between gordon brown and alan millburn about whether foundation trust hospitals will have the independent authority to borrow money is just one example of the private battle now being fought .
soon , the government will have to resolve its disagreements if the programme of reform is to go forward and deliver the improvement in services that the public demands .
and whatever the decision , it is bound to have major consequences for the future of those services , the labour party and the uk 's welfare state .

a new survey by the people who ran the campaign has found we 're still a nation of litterbugs - with each of us dropping just under half a tonne of rubbish a year .
breakfast was live in manchester : one of the few places where the survey found the streets are getting cleaner : the bbc 's kevin bocquet spoke to geoff fisher from the council .
the bbc 's tom heap has been looking at the report , and said : " each of us on average drops just under half a tonne of litter every year .
this works out as 25 million tonnes of rubbish making the country look a mess and costing a fortune to clear up .
changes in the way we live seem to be making the problem worse .
more packaged food is eaten on the streets , more of us chew gum and the authors of today 's report claim we 've lost the keep britain tidy philosophy saying we 're ' too ignorant to use a bin ' .
there are also some surprising findings - the most widespread source of commercial litter is elastic bands dropped by postmen .
poor planning of cleaning and refuse collection is making the problem worse , and street sweeping is failing to collect all the dust and soil allowing weeds to grow .
left unchecked this can crack the paving .
but its not all the councils fault .
the emerging street café culture and more signs on the pavement mean it 's harder to clean up .
it 's like trying to vacuum a carpet cluttered with furniture .
the report points out what can be achieved by determined local government .
six years ago manchester was bottom of the tidiness league .
but now they 've tackled graffiti , fly posting , and appointed wardens to issue litter fines .
making the north-west the bets performing region . "
we have recieved many emails on this subject .
below is a selection .
i live in the countryside and we have people drive out especially to dump anything from washing machines , furniture and garden waste , always amazes me how they make a special trip but can not make one to a local waste site .
we should be like sngapore anyone who drops litter is fined a £ 1000 and made to do community service cleaning it up jane payne it used to be that returning from abroad i looked forward to the experience - no more ! , my heart sinks ! .
compared for example to dubai , britain is a filthy , dangerous , and depressing place , worthy of the epithet , third world .
i look forward to retiring far away from the accumulating dross , that permeates this polluted land .
david bonner as an individual i try to do my bit to keep my neighbourhood at waterloo tidy , but its an uphill struggle when the council is working against you .
a well-known american burger joint and chain coffee store recently opened up at the bottom of the station .
since then litter has got out of control and no-one seems to want to make the companies in question clean it up or change their packaging .
there are hardly any bins locally and those that exist are full to overflowing by midday .
there are no dog waste bins .
there are no street-sweepers or dog wardens .
we ca n't expect people to develop a culture of respect for their communities when it 's so clear penny-pinching government and greedy business do n't care .
we ca n't teach young people to use the bins when there is so much packaging to throw away and nowhere to throw it .
john kennedy the main road a2 from blackwall tunnel to the m2 in kent is a total disgrace with litter which has been there for months all alongside the road .
there has been no attempt to clean , but money has been found for numerous speed cameras to be installed .
mike golsby although the dropping of litter is undeniably a huge problem , it is not eased by the lack of litter bins in major towns or cities .
this is presumably due to the fear of terrorist attack .
the potential targets tend to be tourist attractions where people congregate and the problem just increases .
similarly many railway stations do not have adequate facilities to dispose of / recycle the litter generated by their many cafes / food outlets .
vee pollock why do smokers treat the world as one gigantic ashtray ?
they also always seem to buy cars without ashtrays so that they have to throw everything out the window ?

he added that a meeting in the summer decided cymdeithas would accept the bequest , as no objections had been raised by any members .

a ban on overtime by drivers working for first north western means 160 trains a day will be cancelled from monday .
but peak-time travellers will not be affected , as the cancellations will take place during less busy times .
the action follows a 48-hour stoppage which was held by drivers over the weekend .
it caused widespread disruption to travellers , including delegates travelling to the labour party conference in blackpool .
the union aslef has also organised a number of two-day mid-week walkouts as part of the long-running dispute .
it claims a 19 % pay offer over three years from first north western has " unacceptable strings attached " .

the china yangtze electric corporation was formed on 29 september , according to the china daily , with the aim of selling shares on the shanghai market next year .
with listings in hong kong and elsewhere to follow , the paper said , there will be a continuous flow of public offerings till 2009 to pay for the 26 huge electric generators the dam will require .
to attract the needed investment , the paper said , half of net profits will go to dividends for investors .
the dam is costing a total of about $ 27bn -lrb- £ 17.4 -rrb- , and is expected to end up creating an artificial lake 600km long and about 200 metres deep .
a matter of pride the project - intended not only to supply huge quantities of electricity but to alleviate china 's huge flooding problems - has already attracted controversy for the scale of the disruption it is causing , and the potential for environmental damage .
after years as the favoured public works project of international donors , dam-building has fallen out of favour in recent years which could hit the chances of landing the much-needed investment .
but even the legacy of massive , internationally-funded projects such as india 's narmada dam and lesotho 's highlands water project are nowhere near the scale of the three gorges initiative .
creating a dam across the yangtze has become a matter of public pride for china 's government , and so far more than a million people have been uprooted to make way for it .

cymdeithas yr iaith gymraeg - the welsh language society - has apologised unreservedly for the distress it had caused people allegedly abused by the late television writer and former teacher , john owen .
the organisation had come under fire from the families of people who claim they were abused by mr owen , after it had initially decided to accept £ 100,000 from his will .
mr owen killed himself a year ago the day before he was due in court to face allegations of child abuse .
cymdeithas spokesman ffred ffransis said the organisation - which had not yet received the cash - had been forced to rethink its stance after it had been contacted by some its own supporters who claim they were victims of mr owen .
they had said they would face further pain and suffering if the group , which campaigns to promote the welsh language , accepted the money from mr owen 's will .
the society , which admits to having finances in an almost permanent state of crisis , had previously defended the decision to accept the money .
but in an interview on bbc radio wales , mr ffransis explained how and why the organisation had reversed its position .
" we acted on incorrect information , " he said .
" following the disclosures yesterday , a number of the people who have been through pain and suffering because of this terrible tragedy , they did contact us , as supporters of cymdeithas yr iaith .
" they told us personally that it would cause them further pain and suffering for us to take this money .
" as a result there were frantic phone calls all last night and we managed by midnight to contact all the senate members of cymdeithas yr iaith who were involved in the original decision and that decision has been reversed . "

the 49-year-old , from tylorstown , rhondda , south wales , had taken a lethal overdose of morphine the day before he was due back in court .
cymdeithas ' decision has been given a tentative welcome by a hywel james , a solicitor acting for a number of families giving evidence at the clywch inquiry run by mr clarke .

film director ken loach has addressed several thousand protestors at a huge anti-war demonstration in london .
ex-un weapons inspector scott ritter and campaigning journalist john pilger also joined a broad cross-section of campaigners at the rally organised by the stop the war coalition and the muslim association of britain from the rally , mr loach told the bbc that a war with iraq would be " monstrous " and that prime minister tony blair " does not speak in the name of the british people " .
campaigners say public opposition to bombing iraq has grown since the government published their evidence on saddam 's weapons programme .
ministers say that the threat of force is the only way to resolve the iraqi crisis peacefully .
would you go to a march like this ?
what do you think it can achieve ?
are public demonstrations on the rise ?
this talking point is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
over 50 years ago , my parents were peace marchers .
when war came they were among the first to lose a son .
hitler became a fanatic dictator .
my parents regretted not supportiing stopping hitler when he began to break treaties years earlier .
dictators do not think like normal people and must be stopped sooner than too late .
graham lawson , uk i marched yesterday and the most moving sight for me was the elderly gentleman walking with a stick and accompanied by a young grandchild , both wearing the badge of ' jews for justice for palestinians ' .
m a qavi , united kingdom democratic nations should not be afraid to intervene will thomas , uk ken loach randomly claims that a figure of 100,000 iraqis are sure to die in any conflict , but compared to the millions of deaths saddam has been responsible for and the millions at risk , loach 's figure is small beer .
the international community should show resolve on issues such as this , and the great democratic nations who have the power to do so , should not be afraid to intervene in the affairs of people suffering at the hands of oppressive and non-representative regimes such as iraq 's .
will thomas , uk i would certainly march .
i have read the iraq dossier which was supposed to put the government case for war against iraq .
it has not convinced me one bit .
ar varachhia , england who would have thought that a labour prime minister would make thatcher look like a peace-loving supporter of democracy ?
it is utterly disgraceful that our leader is effectively the american foreign secretary , and seems hellbent on pursuing this agenda of violence regardless of the facts , the danger to our armed forces , or the will of those he supposedly represents .
adam , england i wish i could be in london today beth moore henry , usa i checked out bbc news online first thing this morning for news of this demonstration .
i have participated in two here in texas over the past week , and i wish i could be in london today .
thank you to all those who have come out today ; my heart is with you all .
we must stop our governments from plunging us into a global holocaust , and from murdering innocent people for oil , power , and money .
beth moore henry , usa no , i do not support the march .
i am a non-muslim asian and i know many non-muslims who do not support this march .
this march gives aid and comfort to the saddam ; with this march they are helping him maintain his evil regime .
if the marchers genuinely feel for the iraqi people , why is there not a single placard denouncing saddam ?
mm , uk no , count me out of it .
i 'm staying home with the wife and kids .
that goes for the war as well .
dave , uk marches like this should be ignored jeff thomson , uk i do n't care what the majority of the public think .
for example , post-soham , most people wanted to bring back hanging for child murderers , but that does n't make it a good idea .
i am glad that we do not have mob rule and marches like this should be ignored .
if you do n't like a policy , write to your mp and tell them - they are your democratically-elected representative .
jeff thomson , uk i am going to the peace demonstration , which i regard as a part of the broader anti-capitalist movement .
the demonstration will show that a large amount of people can mobilise quickly to show the strength of public opposition to western armed aggression .
if iraq is attacked , then i believe most of those on the demonstration will participate in direct action throughout the country .
britain will be closed down as soon as war is declared .
daniel brett , uk i do n't think the march will achieve much because the us and uk governments now see that if they can control who is in charge of countries in the middle east , they will be able to force them to sell their oil cheaper .
the fact that they went to war against saddam little over a decade ago is a convenient excuse , and the inevitable suffering of the iraqi people is of little concern .
niall , ireland these protestors are wrong and misguided paul , uk i agree with allowing demonstrations especially on such an important issue , but i believe these protestors are wrong and misguided .
not to go to war now will endanger all of our futures , not just the people of iraq .
paul , uk how do these protesters think we can get saddam to comply with the un resolutions : send him a petition ? !
whilst i have my concerns over invading iraq , i see no other way in ousting saddam , as we have all seen sanctions have not worked .
jason , manchester , england i will certainly not march but i completely respect the democratic right of people of all nationalities , religions and opinions to peacefully make their point .
this is , of course , in complete contrast to what you would be allowed to do in the country of saddam hussein .
jack delawney , uk i just want to stand up and be counted with the many others who oppose this war jean scott-barr , uk i just want to stand up and be counted with the many others who oppose this war .
it is immoral and being planned to take the attention of american people away from the corporate woes in their own country .
jean scott-barr , uk if the government takes as much notice as it did of the countryside march , then you might as well stay at home .
michael , uk it 's interesting to note how many people plan on attending this rally because they feel it 's wrong for one country -lrb- the us -rrb- to interfere in the governance of another country -lrb- iraq -rrb- .
the irony of course is that the marchers are doing the exact same thing which they are protesting against .
the very point of the march is to influence the governance of other countries .
it 's fascinating to see how self-righteous some folks can be when set out to judge the actions of others .
linda a barbosa , usa linda barbosa says the marchers are trying to influence the actions of the us .
no , it 's to influence the conduct of the uk government , which is completely out of touch with uk public opinion .
the chances of influencing bush are negligible , since his motives are the forthcoming elections and avoiding embarrassing questions about enron .
david smith , uk invading iraq will further inflame islamic anti-american and anti-british feeling tony baxter , uk the march will be a demonstration of the depth and strength of anti-war feeling .
it reflects a very common view among ordinary people that the pm 's foreign policy is that of a 51st us state .
hence his apparent willingness for war even if the un rejects military action .
the pre-emptive strike is understandable american foreign policy post 9/11 , but it is too aggressive , in this case , as the west has warned saddam since the gulf war not to launch weapons on his neighbours or risk destruction .
therefore an invasion is unnecessary and the middle east oil reserves are safe .
invading iraq will however further inflame islamic anti-american and anti-british feeling , and will make terrorist attacks against the uk more likely .
tony baxter , uk yes i will be supporting and attending the peace rally .
the majority of the public are against any war on iraq , and we need to make our voices heard .
thousands of innocent people are going to die , and we simply can not stand back and allow this to happen .
nazir ismail , england whatever their good intentions may be , the marchers will be doing saddam 's work for him anthony jones , uk presumably what the marchers hope to achieve is to prevent any war against iraq , thus ensuring that saddam hussein remains in power and that the iraqi people continue to suffer under his tyranny .
whatever their good intentions may be , the marchers will be doing saddam 's work for him .
anthony jones , uk i fully intended to join the march , until i found out that it is being organised by cnd and an islamic group .
i do not agree with cnd at all , and i think religion should be kept out of the debate at all costs .
i strongly suspect that one or both of these groups will hijack the march for their own purposes .
the march would be a lot more meaningful if it comprised of the ordinary man and woman off the street , without some other axe to grind .
gb , uk 100 % .
let 's show tony blair the full force of public concern .
wgs , uk i think we will see a winter of discontent anon when a government stops listening to the people it reports to or who elected it , then yes demonstrations will take place .
as for this government i think we will see a winter of discontent .
the voters wanted a left of centre government not one that emulates and gets closer to the far right of america .
anon participating in a march to protest against a policy is all fair and dandy but can only have very little effect .
it may pinch three minutes of news coverage or if you are lucky may stir some debate , but as tool for forcing change forget it and just enjoy the physical exercise of the march .
the power of real policy change is the polling station , but as we see from uk ' turn outs ' come election time no one really gives a damn .

i do not agree with cnd at all , and i think religion should be kept out of the debate at all costs .
i strongly suspect that one or both of these groups will hijack the march for their own purposes .
the march would be a lot more meaningful if it comprised of the ordinary man and woman off the street , without some other axe to grind .
gb , uk 100 % .
let 's show tony blair the full force of public concern .
wgs , uk " i think we will see a winter of discontent " anon when a government stops listening to the people it reports to or who elected it , then yes demonstrations will take place .
as for this government i think we will see a winter of discontent .
the voters wanted a left of centre government not one that emulates and gets closer to the far right of america .
anon participating in a march to protest against a policy is all fair and dandy but can only have very little effect .
it may pinch three minutes of news coverage or if you are lucky may stir some debate , but as tool for forcing change forget it and just enjoy the physical exercise of the march .
the power of real policy change is the polling station , but as we see from uk ' turn outs ' come election time no one really gives a damn .

the film was billed as uncovering the " complicated yet loving relationship " with his father , prince charles .
the role of the prince was played by jordan frieda , the son of singer lulu and hair stylist john frieda .
it focuses on the prince " dealing with " adolescence and becoming an adult and " covers the years from the death of his mother , princess diana , to his arrival at st andrew 's college " .
in the film , william is shown urging the royal family to abandon protocol and recognise the mood of the nation in the wake of his mother 's death .
his character tells the queen : " please granny , the whole country thinks we do n't care , please do something . "
the film 's executive producer bonnie raskin said she believed the palace had a copy of a script .
aides for prince charles at st james 's palace have not commented on the film but earlier this year royal aides said they were " disappointed " at the " insensitivity " of the film .
in the film william is seen drinking with friends tom and laura parker-bowles , the children of charles ' partner , camilla .
in one nightclub scene , socialite tara palmer-tomkinson exposes herself to the prince .
william is also shown bumping into tables and throwing up after getting drunk in a pub on his 16th birthday .
prince 's regrets another drunken episode sees his character raiding the wine cellars at buckingham palace after a group of his eton schoolfriends are invited to meet the queen .
and charles 's relationship with his son is also explored , with the prince of wales sympathetic to william 's worries about becoming king and revealing his own regrets about not marrying camilla .
" there are some great opportunities about being in his position , " said frieda , who had a small role in the series band of brothers , and was cast just a few days before production began .
" there are some ridiculously hard things - it 's got to be an enormous amount of pressure . "
filming took place in ireland , where castles doubled for royal homes such as buckingham palace and balmoral .

one of the things helping developing countries to rapidly close the communications gap with the west is the mobile phone .
it has become an essential , or annoying , part of modern life , depending on your point of view .
in parts of the developing world , they are catching on like wildfire .
this project , from conception to launch here in kabul , took three months greg grant , awcc wireless technologies like this offer a quick and cheap way to leapfrog the messy and expensive business of building physical telephone networks .
in afghanistan , the country 's landline network has been torn to bits by 20 years of war .
what is left is out of date .
quick and easy to put new wires in the ground would take decades and be prohibitively expensive .
instead installing a modern mobile phone network is cheaper , quicker and easier .
" this project , from conception to launch here in kabul , took three months , " said greg grant , senior engineer with the afghan wireless communication company .
from having hardly any phones , suddenly those afghanis who can afford it are using one of the latest western communications devices .
when the mobiles first went on sale earlier in the year , nearly 400 people have shelled out the $ 350 for a handset in the first few days .
mobile market it is a pattern being repeated elsewhere in the developing world .
wireless communications networks are rapidly spreading where hardwired networks have been slow to grow .
in china , mobile phone usage is exploding .
if this trend continues , by this time next year the number of people with access to a mobile phone will actually exceed the number of people who have fixed line phones .
they 've become big users of mobile technology because it 's much less expensive to put that technology in bob hayward , gartner currently about a 192 million chinese have a landline , but mobiles are close behind .
there are 167 million chinese users , making it the biggest mobile market on earth .
some telecommunications analysts think mobile usage there could spread right out into the poorer rural areas of china , where the majority of the population live .
these are places that have never even seen a landline .
" there 's a long way to go before china wires up some of the remote regional communities , " explained bob hayward , of analyst firm gartner .
" even some of the reasonably large cities of up to a million people are not very well configured with infrastructure today .
" they 've become big users of mobile technology because it 's much less expensive to put that technology in , " he said .
" they 're leapfrogging the whole wired phenomenon . "
it means that parts of the developing world could eventually leapfrog straight to wireless internet , without ever having seen a landline .
clickonline is broadcast on bbc world at various times across the globe .
