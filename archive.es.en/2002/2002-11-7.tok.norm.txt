program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.11.2002 germany 's temp work plan faces challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government wants fewer people to have to take a number at their local employment offices the government 's plan to promote temporary work for its close to four million unemployed is facing considerable criticism in parliament .
critics say the current bill would make it harder for companies to hire new people . when it released its report in september , an independent commission appointed by the government and led by volkswagen executive peter hartz borrowed generously from temporary work success stories in the united kingdom and holland , where temp jobs have helped reduce unemployment rolls .
a key provision of the hartz plan called on the government to effectively turn its 181 local employment offices into temp agencies .
but in a country where the idea of a legally protected lifetime job is practically hardwired into the social code , temporary work has long been viewed as anathema .
temporary workers make up less than 1 percent of the workforce here compared to 3.7 and 4.5 percent in the u.k. and holland respectively .
with close to four million unemployed , the government believes temporary jobs may be the best solution for the long-term jobless .
nonetheless , the concept still has its share of critics , and their voices threatened to overshadow a debate on the hartz legislation in parliament on thursday .
though the bill does call for a loosening of germany 's strict labor laws in order to better accommodate temporary work , critics say it adds fresh barriers .
" thousands of jobs will be threatened " currently , temporary work contracts are limited to two years under german labor law .
a company is prohibited from extending a second contract to the same worker without offering them a legally protected permanent position .
the new law would lift both of those restrictions , allowing companies to create a more flexible workforce .
but critics say the bill lacks the teeth of temporary work programs in holland and britain - where labor costs for temps can be as much as 30 percent less than those of full-time employees - because it would require temp workers to be paid wages equal to those of staff employees .
the only exception is for the longterm unemployed , whom companies could pay lower wages for the first six weeks of their employment .
dieter hundt , the head of the german employer 's association , said he feared the hartz legislation will further exacerbate the country 's high unemployment .
" if additional barriers to employment are established , tens of thousands of jobs will be threatened , " he said on thursday .
" it just shows one more time the government 's unwillingness to recognize the explosiveness of the situation . "
" the unions have prevailed " members of parliament from the opposition christian democratic union have also taken aim at the legislation .
according to the party 's spokesman on labor issues , karl-josef laumann , the christian democrats are planning to introduce their own version of the bill next week , which would only require employers to give temp workers equivalent pay after 12 months on the same job .
without that change , laumann said he doubted the government 's plan for temporary work would have the desired effect .
the deputy of the christian democrats ' parliamentary group , friedrich merz , lamented : " there is practically nothing left of the hartz commission 's plan for temporary work .
the unions have fully prevailed with their demand of ' equal pay for equal work ' . "
others , including german confederation of small business and skilled crafts head hans-eberhard schleyer , warned that the government 's temporary work plan would be financially " unattractive " to many companies because the limitations imposed by the government , as well as the added bureaucracy , would make it too expensive for many companies .

the archbishop of bulawayo , pius ncube , says black farmworkers are the real victims when white farms are handed over to government supporters .
mr mugabe , he says , seems ready to starve his own people to keep power .
travelling around zimbabwe you can not miss the effects of robert mugabe 's land reforms : lorries are loaded with goods hastily cleared from their homes by white farmers 6,000 commercial farms have now become 200 up to one million black farmworkers who do not share in the re-distribution sleep rough or in refugee camps most settlers moving onto white lands do not have the seeds , the tools or the know-how to grow crops so land lies bare and unploughed in this sowing season .
everywhere queues for basic foods like maize and bread get longer daily .
aid effort hampered the archbishop of bulawayo told the bbc that zimbabwe 's economy was in tatters , with both professional people and the poor leaving the country in droves because of mr mugabe .
he said the president did not care if his people starved and he should stand down .
aid agencies have already warned that up to six million zimbabweans face severe hunger because of drought .
they will admit privately that land reform has hastened a crisis but will not criticise the government publicly because it is drawing up laws to restrict , even ban , their operations if food is not distributed as it sees fit .
that means it goes to government supporters , the evidence shows .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- q & a : film festival director bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point thursday , 7 november , 2002 , 06:48 gmt q & a : film festival director london film festival 's new artistic director explains the background to how the movies film-goers enjoy make it into the programme .
how did the lff begin ?
it started in 1956 when a group of film critics headed by the famous dilys powell - the film critic for the sunday times - got together over dinner .
they discussed the festivals at cannes and venice and agreed that london needed one too .
its aim was to give the public the opportunity to see great films from around the world that were not being shown in the cinema and certainly not on tv .
there are a number of directors historically - such as john carpenter of hallowe 'en fame - who say they owe their success to the festival it started with around 20 films all shown at the national film theatre on the south bank .
gradually the size and significance has grown as the public has become more interested .
it was originally a " festival of festival " , with a selection largely drawn from films which had received their premieres at other international festival .
now the festival has grown in size , and range , to include some 180 feature films and around 80 short films each year , screened at several venues across the capital .
who is the festival for ?
we do have an important industry and marketing function but the public is definitely the priority .
other festivals are competitive , industry events orientated around press and selling and the public can not attend .
our festival is run by the british film institute -lrb- bfi -rrb- and our cultural mission is to grant public access to films which , in the majority , they would not have access to otherwise .
more than 65 % of the films and videos we show receive their only uk screenings at the festival .
we regard it as being critically important to show people what 's going on in the world of cinema .
does the lff have an influence on british cinema ?
there is a mutual relationship between the festival and british cinema .
it is obviously important that we support the british industry , and we do this in a number of ways .
first of all , we showcase new films through the programme , we also organise panel events and discussions with british and international film-makers , giving them the opportunity to share experiences and knowledge .
one important area for the festival is to encourage and support new british talent , through the shorts showcases , and by screening new british shorts before each new british feature films .
the industry office of the festival accredits producers , sales agents , distributors , broadcasters and the like , alongside the directors , writers , and so on , connected to each of the films , and offers industry seminars and networking events for aspiring film-makers .
in return , the festival is fortunate in having the support of the uk film-making community , who submit their films to us for screening , and who also generously give their time to take part in the many events that we run .
how are films selected ?
the festival has a very broad remit , which is to screen the best of world cinema from the previous 12 months .
this includes feature films , documentaries , short films and artists ' films and videos .
alongside this there is also a dedicated strand of archive restorations .
there is a core programming team inhouse .
the artistic director has overall curatorial responsibility , and devises the overall shape of the festival programme and the balance between individual programme strands in consultation with the executive director .
the festival operates an open submission policy and receives hundreds of unsolicited films and videos .
however , many of the films are tracked from their early stages of production -lrb- or even pre-production -rrb- as it is important that the festival is very up-to-date with new developments in world cinema .
the programming team spend a considerable amount of time travelling to view films , either at other international festivals , or in their countries of origin .
to do this we often receive assistance from national film promotional agencies , such as italia cinema and unifrance .
aside from the direct programming contributions of the various advisors , we also talk informally to critics , academics , sales agents and other industry colleagues , and receive recommendations from them .
in every section , we look for a balance of quality , diversity , innovation , the first flowering of new talent and examples of how different countries are experimenting with certain genres .
ultimately , we hope to select the best available work .
are any types of film considered unacceptable ?
we have formal restrictions , for example whether a film is a british première .
but there are no restrictions based on category or type as it could mean missing some interesting work .
that said , there is not any extreme horror or pornography because it is unlikely that those types of film produce the quality we want - but we do n't rule them out .
how does the content of the lff compare to other festivals ?

aid agencies have already warned that up to six million zimbabweans face severe hunger because of drought .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- q & a : film festival director news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : entertainment news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk thursday , 7 november , 2002 , 06:48 gmt q & a : film festival director london film festival 's new artistic director explains the background to how the movies film-goers enjoy make it into the programme .
how did the lff begin ?
it started in 1956 when a group of film critics headed by the famous dilys powell - the film critic for the sunday times - got together over dinner .
they discussed the festivals at cannes and venice and agreed that london needed one too .
its aim was to give the public the opportunity to see great films from around the world that were not being shown in the cinema and certainly not on tv .
there are a number of directors historically - such as john carpenter of hallowe 'en fame - who say they owe their success to the festival it started with around 20 films all shown at the national film theatre on the south bank .
gradually the size and significance has grown as the public has become more interested .
it was originally a " festival of festival " , with a selection largely drawn from films which had received their premieres at other international festival .
now the festival has grown in size , and range , to include some 180 feature films and around 80 short films each year , screened at several venues across the capital .
who is the festival for ?
we do have an important industry and marketing function but the public is definitely the priority .
other festivals are competitive , industry events orientated around press and selling and the public can not attend .
our festival is run by the british film institute -lrb- bfi -rrb- and our cultural mission is to grant public access to films which , in the majority , they would not have access to otherwise .
more than 65 % of the films and videos we show receive their only uk screenings at the festival .
we regard it as being critically important to show people what 's going on in the world of cinema .
does the lff have an influence on british cinema ?
there is a mutual relationship between the festival and british cinema .
it is obviously important that we support the british industry , and we do this in a number of ways .
first of all , we showcase new films through the programme , we also organise panel events and discussions with british and international film-makers , giving them the opportunity to share experiences and knowledge .
one important area for the festival is to encourage and support new british talent , through the shorts showcases , and by screening new british shorts before each new british feature films .
the industry office of the festival accredits producers , sales agents , distributors , broadcasters and the like , alongside the directors , writers , and so on , connected to each of the films , and offers industry seminars and networking events for aspiring film-makers .
in return , the festival is fortunate in having the support of the uk film-making community , who submit their films to us for screening , and who also generously give their time to take part in the many events that we run .
how are films selected ?
the festival has a very broad remit , which is to screen the best of world cinema from the previous 12 months .
this includes feature films , documentaries , short films and artists ' films and videos .
alongside this there is also a dedicated strand of archive restorations .
there is a core programming team inhouse .
the artistic director has overall curatorial responsibility , and devises the overall shape of the festival programme and the balance between individual programme strands in consultation with the executive director .
the festival operates an open submission policy and receives hundreds of unsolicited films and videos .
however , many of the films are tracked from their early stages of production -lrb- or even pre-production -rrb- as it is important that the festival is very up-to-date with new developments in world cinema .
the programming team spend a considerable amount of time travelling to view films , either at other international festivals , or in their countries of origin .
to do this we often receive assistance from national film promotional agencies , such as italia cinema and unifrance .
aside from the direct programming contributions of the various advisors , we also talk informally to critics , academics , sales agents and other industry colleagues , and receive recommendations from them .
in every section , we look for a balance of quality , diversity , innovation , the first flowering of new talent and examples of how different countries are experimenting with certain genres .
ultimately , we hope to select the best available work .
are any types of film considered unacceptable ?
we have formal restrictions , for example whether a film is a british première .
but there are no restrictions based on category or type as it could mean missing some interesting work .
that said , there is not any extreme horror or pornography because it is unlikely that those types of film produce the quality we want - but we do n't rule them out .
how does the content of the lff compare to other festivals ?
as we are primarily a public festival , we are able to retain something of the feel of a " festival of festivals " , which means audiences will have the opportunity to see some of the films they 've read about from other international festivals such as cannes or venice .
