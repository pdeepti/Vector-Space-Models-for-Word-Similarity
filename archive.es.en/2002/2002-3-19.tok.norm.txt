in germany , andersen 's local management issued a joint statement with rival kpmg saying they were in talks over a tie-up .
furthermore , it could involve all the audit firm 's major markets outside the us .
" we are currently exploring how our current business activities outside the united states in the most important countries of europe , africa , the near east , canada , asia and latin america can be merged , " said head of kpmg germany harald weidemann .
christoph gross , head of andersen deutschland , said : " this is a chance we want to use in the interests of our clients and employees . "
andersen offices in australia , europe and china have also revealed they are considering quitting the group and merging with rival accountancy companies .
relaxing the rules in the meantime , the us securities and exchange commission has issued formal guidelines for andersen clients , providing temporary relief on their obligation to file financial statements .
from monday , companies that can not or do not want their audits to be completed by andersen will be allowed to submit unaudited statements on a temporary basis .
the sec 's move is likely to increase the exodus of customers away from andersen , many of whose clients were reluctant to decamp during the reporting season .
job-hunting in the uk , where andersen chiefs are believed to have held tie-up talks with deloitte touche , the firm also faces a staff exodus , reports said .
" we are seeing an increasing number -lsb- of andersen staff -rsb- at all levels , " said martin purrier of recruitment firm hunter walker .
a boss at a rival uk accounting firm claimed that growing numbers of andersen employees , including senior partners , were seeking information on jobs .
the reports will disappoint andersen chiefs attempting to keep the network together after the indictment last week of andersen 's us business over claims it shredded " tons " of paperwork relating to the collapse of energy firm enron .
andersen also faces a one-year suspension on new us government business and has seen about 50 firms , including delta airlines and drugs firm merck , quit for other auditors .
pharmaceuticals company wyeth on monday became the latest firm to ditch andersen .

national operations revealed on monday to be holding independent merger talks included : switzerland , where partner edgar brandt was quoted as saying : " we 're studying all the options without panicking . "
china , where andersen bosses said the firm was " actively engaged in discussion about its future with other accounting firms in the country " .
australia , where regional boss gary hounsell said the firm was continuing " to canvas a range of local and regional options " .
poland , where the branch said it was " trying to take into account all possibilities " .
french operations were on monday declining to comment on reports of merger talks with competitor deloitte & touche .
andersen france chairman aldo cardoso said in an interview with monday 's les echos newspaper that european andersen operations wished " to continue to be part of the network " .
" of course certain firms could decide to leave , " he said .
" but in europe , apart from spain ... nobody has chosen this path . "
takeover prize the andersen worldwide network employs about 85,000 staff in 390 offices in 84 countries .
andersen worldwide chiefs have sought to find a buyer for large chunks of the network , or even all operations , to maximise selling power .
" in europe , andersen 's united force would be reduced by individual negotiations , " mr brandt of andersen switzerland said .
but the network 's structure means that individual offices have been able to undertake independent negotiations .
and , by distancing themselves from andersen 's beleaguered us business , regional offices have sought to secure a higher price , observers said .
risks and rewards andersen , as a partnership , splits profits between its 5,000 partners , rather than with shareholders as it would as a listed company .
the partnership structure , common in professions such as law and accountancy , can offer the chance for large rewards , and employees often pay to gain partnership status .
but with a split in profits comes joint liability , a prospect that , with andersen 's future clouded , is blamed for spurring interest in jobs elsewhere .

the enemy were relentless killers , but the us would be more relentless , he said .
earlier , us commanders had announced the end of the 17-day operation anaconda - an assault on al-qaeda and taleban fighters in the mountains of eastern afghanistan .
mr bush thanked the us troops who took part in the battle but said he was sure that more fighting would be necessary .
rebel forces had even sought to reinforce their comrades during the most intense fighting , he said .
" these are killers , they hate america , they are relentless .
but so are we , and we will be more relentless than they are . "
britain has also signalled there will be further fighting in afghanistan .
defence secretary geoff hoon has announced that the government will be sending 1,700 soldiers to join the fight against remaining al-qaeda and taleban forces . "
future operations are likely to be the same size as anaconda " general tommy franks in a separate development , us officials said american forces killed 16 people on monday in an attack on three vehicles thought to be carrying fleeing al-qaeda fighters in eastern afghanistan .
one person was wounded and another captured , in the attack on the convoy which took place on sunday , 70 kilometres -lrb- 45 miles -rrb- south-west of gardez .
continued threat speaking to journalists at bagram airbase on the outskirts of the afghan capital , kabul , general tommy franks said the threat of more al-qaeda and taleban attacks remained .
" it is possible for al-qaeda and taleban fighters to regroup in various parts of afghanistan and that is why we are not saying that this is over .
i suspect that this kind of operation could happen again , " he said .
us officials estimate 500 fighters have been killed during the offensive in the shah-i-kot valley and arma mountains , south of gardez .
but local afghan commanders have suggested that many of the guerrillas may have escaped into pakistan .
about 2,000 american and afghan government soldiers have taken part in the two-week operation anaconda .
at least 15 of them are thought to have died .
the most intense fighting , the largest us-led offensive in the afghan war , ended last wednesday .
since then , canadian and us soldiers have been working to flush out any remaining fighters .
" you did it on time , you did it with a good plan , you did it with violent execution , you did it taking care of one another , " general franks told troops at a ceremony where he awarded the bronze star to four us servicemen who took part in the operation .

this is the largest single event in a series of retreats by ice shelves in the peninsula over the last 30 years us national snow and ice data center uk scientists say the larsen b shelf on the eastern side of the antarctic peninsula has fragmented into small icebergs .
researchers from the british antarctic survey -lrb- bas -rrb- predicted in 1998 that several ice shelves around the peninsula were doomed because of rising temperatures in the region - but the speed with which the larsen b has gone has shocked them .
" we knew what was left would collapse eventually , but the speed of it is staggering , " said dr david vaughan , a glaciologist at the bas in cambridge .
" -lsb- it is hard -rsb- to believe that 500 billion tonnes of ice sheet has disintegrated in less than a month . "
faster flow the climate on the peninsula has changed rapidly in the last 50 years .
the region has experienced a 2.5-degree-celsius rise in average temperatures - an increase greater than for any location in the southern hemisphere .
however , the picture generally in antarctica is a complicated one with temperatures in the interior actually falling over the same period .
there is also some evidence that the retreat of the west antarctic ice sheet , on the other side of the peninsula to the larsen b shelf , has halted .
the larsen b was one of five ice shelves - huge masses of ice that are floating extensions of the ice sheets covering the land - that had been steadily shrinking because of climate change , dr vaughan said .
but the break up of the ice mass would not raise sea levels because the ice was already floating , he added .
sea levels would only be affected if the land ice behind it now began to flow more rapidly into the sea .
gather data the uk scientists were first alerted to the larsen b collapse by us colleagues studying images from the american space agency 's modis satellite .
the area is now littered with small icebergs the british antarctic survey then dispatched its research ship rrs james clark ross to the area to obtain photographs and samples .
scientists hope the data gathered on site will help them determine when such an event last happened and which ice shelves are threatened in future .
the us-based national snow and ice data center -lrb- nsidc -rrb- said on tuesday : " this is the largest single event in a series of retreats by ice shelves in the peninsula over the last 30 years .
" the retreats are attributed to a strong climate warming in the region . "
future predictions " we know that the climate in this area has been relatively stable for at least 1,800 years , but now it is starting to change , " dr vaughan told the bbc .
" has it been kicked off by -lrb- human induced -rrb- global warming or is it something a bit more natural ?
" for glaciologists this is fascinating because we can see the processes at work and we can predict with more certainty what is going to happen in the rest of antarctica .
" as far as global implications are concerned , there are few as far as the present event is concerned . "
locally , however , dr vaughan said there would be ecological changes as organisms moved into the seabed area no longer covered by ice .
big berg us scientists also reported on tuesday that an iceberg more than nine times larger than singapore had broken off antarctica .
this image of b-22 was taken on 11 march the national ice center said the berg , named b-22 , broke free from an ice tongue in the amundsen sea , an area of antarctica south of the pacific ocean .
it is more than 64 kilometres -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- wide and 85 kilometres -lrb- 53 miles -rrb- long , and covers an area of about 5,500 square kilometres .
icebergs are named for the section of antarctica where they are first sighted .
the b designation covers the amundsen and eastern ross seas and the 22 indicates it is the 22nd iceberg sighted there by the us national ice center . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's emma simpson " the larsen b ice shelf has been disintegrating for years " british antarctic survey 's dr david vaughan " a new area of seabed will be opened to colonisation " christine mcgourty in antarctica ice blockade tourism fears ice collapse climate clues secret base stuck in ice base clear-up penguin climate uk to rebuild lab shackleton island antarctic huts penguin mystery forum you quizzed the british base commander at rothera see also : 06 sep 01 -pipe- sci / tech rapid antarctic warming puzzle internet links : us national snow and ice data center us national ice center british antarctic survey the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top sci / tech stories now : astronomy 's next big thing ancient rock points to life 's origin mobile spam on the rise giant telescope project gets boost new hope for aids vaccine replace your mouse with your eye device could detect overdose drugs wireless internet arrives in china links to more sci / tech stories are at the foot of the page .

faster flow the climate on the peninsula has changed rapidly in the last 50 years .
the region has experienced a 2.5-degree-celsius rise in average temperatures - an increase greater than for any location in the southern hemisphere .
however , the picture generally in antarctica is a complicated one with temperatures in the interior actually falling over the same period .
there is also some evidence that the retreat of the west antarctic ice sheet , on the other side of the peninsula to the larsen b shelf , has halted .
the larsen b was one of five ice shelves - huge masses of ice that are floating extensions of the ice sheets covering the land - that had been steadily shrinking because of climate change , dr vaughan said .
but the break up of the ice mass would not raise sea levels because the ice was already floating , he added .
sea levels would only be affected if the land ice behind it now began to flow more rapidly into the sea .
gather data the uk scientists were first alerted to the larsen b collapse by us colleagues studying images from the american space agency 's modis satellite .
the british antarctic survey then dispatched its research ship rrs james clark ross to the area to obtain photographs and samples .
scientists hope the data gathered on site will help them determine when such an event last happened and which ice shelves are threatened in future .
the us-based national snow and ice data center -lrb- nsidc -rrb- said on tuesday : " this is the largest single event in a series of retreats by ice shelves in the peninsula over the last 30 years .
" the retreats are attributed to a strong climate warming in the region . "
future predictions " we know that the climate in this area has been relatively stable for at least 1,800 years , but now it is starting to change , " dr vaughan told the bbc .
" has it been kicked off by -lrb- human induced -rrb- global warming or is it something a bit more natural ?
" for glaciologists this is fascinating because we can see the processes at work and we can predict with more certainty what is going to happen in the rest of antarctica .
" as far as global implications are concerned , there are few as far as the present event is concerned . "
locally , however , dr vaughan said there would be ecological changes as organisms moved into the seabed area no longer covered by ice .
big berg us scientists also reported on tuesday that an iceberg more than nine times larger than singapore had broken off antarctica .
the national ice center said the berg , named b-22 , broke free from an ice tongue in the amundsen sea , an area of antarctica south of the pacific ocean .
it is more than 64 kilometres -lrb- 40 miles -rrb- wide and 85 kilometres -lrb- 53 miles -rrb- long , and covers an area of about 5,500 square kilometres .
icebergs are named for the section of antarctica where they are first sighted .
the b designation covers the amundsen and eastern ross seas and the 22 indicates it is the 22nd iceberg sighted there by the us national ice center .

labour 's newest mp , the member for ogmore , huw irranca-davies , agreed with them .
this was the third time mps had voted in favour of a ban , as the seesaw battle between the two houses of parliament continues .
the debate moves back to the house of lords on tuesday , which is expected to oppose a hunting with dogs ban .

" i have a lot of ideas because i have listened to a lot of people , " mr michael told the bbc .

anthony scrivener qc , who is a former chairman of the bar council , said the army 's own accident investigation team report revealed a catalogue of errors that amount to " gross negligence " .
wayne richards from cwmavon , near port talbot , was 17 when he was killed in march 2000 following a mix up between blank and live ammunition during a night-time training exercise .
he was fifth training death in four years at the commando training centre at lympstone , east devon .
an inquest into the teenager 's death , held in june last year , recorded a verdict of accidental death .
two years later his father alan said is still fighting for justice in his efforts to find out exactly what happened to his son .
his battle began when the crown prosecution service decided there was insufficient evidence for a criminal prosecution against two members of the training team .
" that particular training team was a shambles from start to finish .
safety was non-existent .
it has been a catalogue of errors which caused my son to be killed , " he said following the inquest .
" it should never have happened . "
bbc wales 's current affairs programme week in week out to be broadcast on tuesday , reveals breaches in procedures in the use of live and blank ammunition that led to wayne richard 's death and a similar shooting of another soldier on the brecon beacons .
twenty-two-year-old grenadier guardsman richard king from kent died after he was shot with a live round during an exercise at the sennybridge army ranges in february 1998 .
the crown prosecution service decided not to prosecute anyone over the death following an investigation by dyfed-powys police .
later an inquest failed to establish why army procedures had failed and the health and safety executive demanded improvements .
his family have now launched a civil action against the ministry of defence in an attempt to find out the truth about mr king 's death and to raise the profile of such accidents .
" we thought with the publicity that came with it , that it would prevent another family , or another soldier having to go through this , but it has n't , " said his sister liz bull .
last month another soldier received a gunshot wound and was seriously injured during an infantry training exercise at sennybridge .
" i mean there 's mr richards and his son wayne and four years almost to the day that my brother was killed at sennybridge another soldier has been injured , " ms bull added .
nobody has ever been court-martialled for mr king 's death and the only recommendations made by the army after his death were changes in a pamphlet dealing with the use of live and blank ammunition .
but two years after richard king 's death , wayne richards was fatally injured , again after a mix-up with live and blank ammunition .
his family are still waiting for the results of the mod 's board of inquiry and are still seeking justice for the death .
both families are calling for the military to control the use of live ammunition more closely so that accidents like this can not be repeated , and for those responsible to be tried in a civilian rather than a military court .
alan richards said : " i will go to any length it needs , any length at all and i 'll just take it to the next stage all the time , and i 'm not giving in . "
