young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .
attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits enjoyed by straight couples were struck down in the upper house of german parliament last year .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn encourages his team mates in front of a huge south korean flag during their 2002 world cup semifinal soccer match at the seoul world cup stadium in seoul , south korea , tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .
chancellor gerhard schröder was quick with congratulations , and said he hoped for a world cup victory .
his opponent in this september ’ s federal elections , edmund stoiber said the german side had " earned the victory . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of koreans jam the square in front of city hall in seoul , south korea tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
up to three million people were expected to crowd the streets of the city to watch the 2002 world cup semi-final match between south korea and germany on big screens later in the day .
south korea is the first asian team to make the semi-finals of the world cup .
-lrb- ap photo / greg baker -rrb- south korea , which saw its team exceed all expectations by reaching the semifinals , finally came back down to earth .
around 10,000 fans had gathered in the streets outside the stadium before the match , all dressed in the red that has hypnotized so many of their team ’ s opponents during this world cup .
after meier blew the final whistle , the fans continued to cheer their team on even as their dreams of a final lay dashed on the seoul stadium floor . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live global 3000 we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the war on terror will figure high on the agenda at this week 's summit of group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leaders in kananaskis , canada .
other issues like free trade and a aid for africa could be overshadowed . when the group of eight meets for their summit on wednesday and thursday in kananaskis , canada , one of the main topics on the agenda will be helping russia to remove its atomic weapons and safely store the nuclear material .
other issues , such as financial aid to africa , free trade , and the middle east , will most likely be pushed to the side , as the us-led war on terrorism threatens to dominate the group ’ s discussion rounds .
diplomats say senior canadian officials are privately musing whether the g8 has become the g1 , where the united states can do pretty much as it pleases while other nations stand on the sidelines .
" we all fear that this will turn into an ‘ everyone against bush ’ meeting , which is not good news , " one senior g8 diplomat told reuters news agency .
but at a pre-summit meeting with canadian minister jean chrétien on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said g8 leaders are united and share a consensus on supporting joint efforts to ensure that russia ’ s nuclear weapons do not fall into the hands of terrorists .
leaders from canada , italy , france , britain , germany , japan , the us and russia will have two days of talks in the secluded rocky mountain resort to focus on this phase of the american war on terrorism .
ten-year plan on his visit to berlin in may , the american president outlined a ten-year plan to drastically reduce russia ’ s existing nuclear arsenal and provide safe storage for nuclear material .
the plan calls for the united states , and the g8 members collectively , to each contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.3 billion euro -rrb- to the nuclear nonproliferation initiative .
the reduction of atomic missiles is part of the american war on terror .
in the aftermath of the september 11th terrorist attacks , the united states has increased efforts to prevent terrorists from obtaining nuclear , biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction .
the us is concerned that nuclear war heads or nuclear material that could turn conventional explosive devices into " dirty bombs " may fall into the hands of terrorists .
one point of discussion among the g8 leaders will be which nuclear nations should be included in the program .
still , the plan is unlikely to be ready for debate at the kananaskis summit , in part because other countries are reluctant to hand over such large amounts of money , and russia has not made it clear whether it would sign up for the deal .
trade without frontiers in whatever time remains for other issues , participants are expected to discuss the global economy and prospects for economic recovery .
free trade will likely be brought up in president bush ’ s presence .
in pre-summit discussions chancellor schröder and prime minister chrétien also criticized trade subsidies and trade barriers as a major obstacle to free international trade in their monday meeting .
recently imposed us steel tariffs and a farm subsidy plan have caused friction between the us and its european allies .
but the german chancellor downplayed the trade dispute between washington and brussels .
“ the differences will soon be resolved , ” he said .
a new partnership with africa if canadian head of state chrétien has his way , the summit will also take a closer look at developing a new partnership between the g8 nations and africa in terms of financial aid .
chrétien wants the second day of the summit to be devoted to a g8 africa action plan which includes measures to help fight poverty and control the hiv and aids crisis .
the plan calls for an ambitious annual foreign investment of $ 64 billion , more than seven times the total amount of african investment in 1999 .
the plan " will be designed to help african governments that are committed to working with , and on behalf of , all of their citizens , " said chrétien the prime minister emphasized that despite the war on terror and the escalation of hostilities in the middle east , the summit will not diverge from its focus on africa .
however , president bush has not come out with any statements on the topic , and his speech on monday unveiling a new middle east policy could further shift the summit ’ s focus away from africa .
pre-summit schedule after monday ’ s press conference with prime minister chrétien , chancellor schröder spent tuesday in montréal giving a speech before the conférence de montréal , a gathering of high-ranking representatives from the worlds of economics , politics and science .
afterwards schröder visited the canadian rail technology corporation bombardier .
earlier this year , chancellor schröder was instrumental in preventing the closure of the german branch of bombardier in the town of ammendorf in saxony-anhalt .
the plant , in one of germany ’ s weakest economic regions , had been threatened with closure and the loss of some 900 jobs until the chancellor stepped in .

young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .
attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits enjoyed by straight couples were struck down in the upper house of german parliament last year .
and unlike gay couples in neighbouring holland , german homosexual couples do not have the right to adopt children . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a summer awash in pink while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week .

that 's more bad news for the struggling retail industry , where 150,000 businesses face bankruptcy this year . germany ’ s economic slump has hit private businesses hard and consumer confidence took an unexpected turn for the worst , according to figures released this week .
almost 150,000 private businesses are facing bankruptcy this year due to the country ’ s high unemployment and low confidence in an economic turnaround .
the monday results , from the country ’ s association for german private businesses -lrb- hde -rrb- , came a day before the munich-based ifo institute revealed that consumer confidence had dipped from may to june .
the drop in confidence was directly connected to monday ’ s bad news .
a slump in the construction industry and private businesses were the reasons the confidence index slipped from 91.6 in june to 91.3 in may , according to the ifo figures .
forget that new suit " the consumer is bombarded with bad news , " said hermann franzen , of the hde .
" that 's no atmosphere in which to buy himself a new suit . "
big business doesn ’ t see any reason to be hopeful either .
companies polled by ifo said that they expected the economy to continue its slump .
" the slip is almost completely due to the not so fortunate expectations for the next six months , " hans werner-sin , ifo ’ s president , told reporters .
werner-sin said his institute , among the leading business forecasters in germany , remained optimistic that a turnaround was in sight .
his counterpart at the private business association wasn ’ t too sure .
political action needed franzen said major changes were still needed in germany ’ s labor market and appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government to initiate the structural reforms necessary .
" hope dies at the very end , " he said in a statement .
" business is living almost completely running on hope at the moment .
that ’ s why we hope things will change after the next election . "
germany has about 4 million unemployed at the moment , about 8.5 percent of the population .
that means less money to spend and a worsening prognosis for private business , said franzen .
exactly one third of the private businesses polled by the association are due to report a drop in annual income of 10 percent .
" we have never had such an unfortunate result , " franzen said in a statement .
euro not to blame the results , though , had little to do with the european union ’ s new currency , said franzen .
consumers have been grumbling since the introduction of the euro that private business has used the new currency to raise prices .
" the euro is only a building block for the downward trend , " said holger wenzel of the hde .
bad news for private business will mean good news for consumers , though .
the hde said it expects more sales in the coming months .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn encourages his team mates in front of a huge south korean flag during their 2002 world cup semifinal soccer match at the seoul world cup stadium in seoul , south korea , tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .
chancellor gerhard schröder was quick with congratulations , and said he hoped for a world cup victory .
his opponent in this september ’ s federal elections , edmund stoiber said the german side had " earned the victory . "

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "

germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .

young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .
attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits enjoyed by straight couples were struck down in the upper house of german parliament last year .
and unlike gay couples in neighbouring holland , german homosexual couples do not have the right to adopt children . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a summer awash in pink while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week .

that 's more bad news for the struggling retail industry , where 150,000 businesses face bankruptcy this year . germany ’ s economic slump has hit private businesses hard and consumer confidence took an unexpected turn for the worst , according to figures released this week .
almost 150,000 private businesses are facing bankruptcy this year due to the country ’ s high unemployment and low confidence in an economic turnaround .
the monday results , from the country ’ s association for german private businesses -lrb- hde -rrb- , came a day before the munich-based ifo institute revealed that consumer confidence had dipped from may to june .
the drop in confidence was directly connected to monday ’ s bad news .
a slump in the construction industry and private businesses were the reasons the confidence index slipped from 91.6 in june to 91.3 in may , according to the ifo figures .
forget that new suit " the consumer is bombarded with bad news , " said hermann franzen , of the hde .
" that 's no atmosphere in which to buy himself a new suit . "
big business doesn ’ t see any reason to be hopeful either .
companies polled by ifo said that they expected the economy to continue its slump .
" the slip is almost completely due to the not so fortunate expectations for the next six months , " hans werner-sin , ifo ’ s president , told reporters .
werner-sin said his institute , among the leading business forecasters in germany , remained optimistic that a turnaround was in sight .
his counterpart at the private business association wasn ’ t too sure .
political action needed franzen said major changes were still needed in germany ’ s labor market and appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government to initiate the structural reforms necessary .
" hope dies at the very end , " he said in a statement .
" business is living almost completely running on hope at the moment .
that ’ s why we hope things will change after the next election . "
germany has about 4 million unemployed at the moment , about 8.5 percent of the population .
that means less money to spend and a worsening prognosis for private business , said franzen .
exactly one third of the private businesses polled by the association are due to report a drop in annual income of 10 percent .
" we have never had such an unfortunate result , " franzen said in a statement .
euro not to blame the results , though , had little to do with the european union ’ s new currency , said franzen .
consumers have been grumbling since the introduction of the euro that private business has used the new currency to raise prices .
" the euro is only a building block for the downward trend , " said holger wenzel of the hde .
bad news for private business will mean good news for consumers , though .
the hde said it expects more sales in the coming months .

that 's more bad news for the struggling retail industry , where 150,000 businesses face bankruptcy this year . germany ’ s economic slump has hit private businesses hard and consumer confidence took an unexpected turn for the worst , according to figures released this week .
almost 150,000 private businesses are facing bankruptcy this year due to the country ’ s high unemployment and low confidence in an economic turnaround .
the monday results , from the country ’ s association for german private businesses -lrb- hde -rrb- , came a day before the munich-based ifo institute revealed that consumer confidence had dipped from may to june .
the drop in confidence was directly connected to monday ’ s bad news .
a slump in the construction industry and private businesses were the reasons the confidence index slipped from 91.6 in june to 91.3 in may , according to the ifo figures .
forget that new suit " the consumer is bombarded with bad news , " said hermann franzen , of the hde .
" that 's no atmosphere in which to buy himself a new suit . "
big business doesn ’ t see any reason to be hopeful either .
companies polled by ifo said that they expected the economy to continue its slump .
" the slip is almost completely due to the not so fortunate expectations for the next six months , " hans werner-sin , ifo ’ s president , told reporters .
werner-sin said his institute , among the leading business forecasters in germany , remained optimistic that a turnaround was in sight .
his counterpart at the private business association wasn ’ t too sure .
political action needed franzen said major changes were still needed in germany ’ s labor market and appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government to initiate the structural reforms necessary .
" hope dies at the very end , " he said in a statement .
" business is living almost completely running on hope at the moment .
that ’ s why we hope things will change after the next election . "
germany has about 4 million unemployed at the moment , about 8.5 percent of the population .
that means less money to spend and a worsening prognosis for private business , said franzen .
exactly one third of the private businesses polled by the association are due to report a drop in annual income of 10 percent .
" we have never had such an unfortunate result , " franzen said in a statement .
euro not to blame the results , though , had little to do with the european union ’ s new currency , said franzen .
consumers have been grumbling since the introduction of the euro that private business has used the new currency to raise prices .
" the euro is only a building block for the downward trend , " said holger wenzel of the hde .

the war on terror will figure high on the agenda at this week 's summit of group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leaders in kananaskis , canada .
other issues like free trade and a aid for africa could be overshadowed . when the group of eight meets for their summit on wednesday and thursday in kananaskis , canada , one of the main topics on the agenda will be helping russia to remove its atomic weapons and safely store the nuclear material .
other issues , such as financial aid to africa , free trade , and the middle east , will most likely be pushed to the side , as the us-led war on terrorism threatens to dominate the group ’ s discussion rounds .
diplomats say senior canadian officials are privately musing whether the g8 has become the g1 , where the united states can do pretty much as it pleases while other nations stand on the sidelines .
" we all fear that this will turn into an ‘ everyone against bush ’ meeting , which is not good news , " one senior g8 diplomat told reuters news agency .
but at a pre-summit meeting with canadian minister jean chrétien on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said g8 leaders are united and share a consensus on supporting joint efforts to ensure that russia ’ s nuclear weapons do not fall into the hands of terrorists .
leaders from canada , italy , france , britain , germany , japan , the us and russia will have two days of talks in the secluded rocky mountain resort to focus on this phase of the american war on terrorism .
ten-year plan on his visit to berlin in may , the american president outlined a ten-year plan to drastically reduce russia ’ s existing nuclear arsenal and provide safe storage for nuclear material .
the plan calls for the united states , and the g8 members collectively , to each contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.3 billion euro -rrb- to the nuclear nonproliferation initiative .
the reduction of atomic missiles is part of the american war on terror .
in the aftermath of the september 11th terrorist attacks , the united states has increased efforts to prevent terrorists from obtaining nuclear , biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction .
the us is concerned that nuclear war heads or nuclear material that could turn conventional explosive devices into " dirty bombs " may fall into the hands of terrorists .
one point of discussion among the g8 leaders will be which nuclear nations should be included in the program .
still , the plan is unlikely to be ready for debate at the kananaskis summit , in part because other countries are reluctant to hand over such large amounts of money , and russia has not made it clear whether it would sign up for the deal .
trade without frontiers in whatever time remains for other issues , participants are expected to discuss the global economy and prospects for economic recovery .
free trade will likely be brought up in president bush ’ s presence .
in pre-summit discussions chancellor schröder and prime minister chrétien also criticized trade subsidies and trade barriers as a major obstacle to free international trade in their monday meeting .
recently imposed us steel tariffs and a farm subsidy plan have caused friction between the us and its european allies .
but the german chancellor downplayed the trade dispute between washington and brussels .
“ the differences will soon be resolved , ” he said .
a new partnership with africa if canadian head of state chrétien has his way , the summit will also take a closer look at developing a new partnership between the g8 nations and africa in terms of financial aid .
chrétien wants the second day of the summit to be devoted to a g8 africa action plan which includes measures to help fight poverty and control the hiv and aids crisis .
the plan calls for an ambitious annual foreign investment of $ 64 billion , more than seven times the total amount of african investment in 1999 .
the plan " will be designed to help african governments that are committed to working with , and on behalf of , all of their citizens , " said chrétien the prime minister emphasized that despite the war on terror and the escalation of hostilities in the middle east , the summit will not diverge from its focus on africa .
however , president bush has not come out with any statements on the topic , and his speech on monday unveiling a new middle east policy could further shift the summit ’ s focus away from africa .
pre-summit schedule after monday ’ s press conference with prime minister chrétien , chancellor schröder spent tuesday in montréal giving a speech before the conférence de montréal , a gathering of high-ranking representatives from the worlds of economics , politics and science .
afterwards schröder visited the canadian rail technology corporation bombardier .
earlier this year , chancellor schröder was instrumental in preventing the closure of the german branch of bombardier in the town of ammendorf in saxony-anhalt .
the plant , in one of germany ’ s weakest economic regions , had been threatened with closure and the loss of some 900 jobs until the chancellor stepped in .

ten-year plan on his visit to berlin in may , the american president outlined a ten-year plan to drastically reduce russia ’ s existing nuclear arsenal and provide safe storage for nuclear material .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "

germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .

the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .

" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "

christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.06.2002 everyday isn ’ t christopher street day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is n't only what homosexuality is about csd may have attracted thousands to its glitzy celebrations this year , but homosexual reality is far from colourful .
young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .

young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .

young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .
attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits enjoyed by straight couples were struck down in the upper house of german parliament last year .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "

germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.06.2002 germany has the shopping blues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for the sales to arrive in german stores figures released on tuesday said german consumer confidence remained low .
that 's more bad news for the struggling retail industry , where 150,000 businesses face bankruptcy this year . germany ’ s economic slump has hit private businesses hard and consumer confidence took an unexpected turn for the worst , according to figures released this week .
almost 150,000 private businesses are facing bankruptcy this year due to the country ’ s high unemployment and low confidence in an economic turnaround .
the monday results , from the country ’ s association for german private businesses -lrb- hde -rrb- , came a day before the munich-based ifo institute revealed that consumer confidence had dipped from may to june .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn encourages his team mates in front of a huge south korean flag during their 2002 world cup semifinal soccer match at the seoul world cup stadium in seoul , south korea , tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .
chancellor gerhard schröder was quick with congratulations , and said he hoped for a world cup victory .
his opponent in this september ’ s federal elections , edmund stoiber said the german side had " earned the victory . "

up to three million people were expected to crowd the streets of the city to watch the 2002 world cup semi-final match between south korea and germany on big screens later in the day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.06.2002 everyday isn ’ t christopher street day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is n't only what homosexuality is about csd may have attracted thousands to its glitzy celebrations this year , but homosexual reality is far from colourful .
young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .
attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits enjoyed by straight couples were struck down in the upper house of german parliament last year .
and unlike gay couples in neighbouring holland , german homosexual couples do not have the right to adopt children . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a summer awash in pink while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week .

the war on terror will figure high on the agenda at this week 's summit of group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leaders in kananaskis , canada .
other issues like free trade and a aid for africa could be overshadowed . when the group of eight meets for their summit on wednesday and thursday in kananaskis , canada , one of the main topics on the agenda will be helping russia to remove its atomic weapons and safely store the nuclear material .
other issues , such as financial aid to africa , free trade , and the middle east , will most likely be pushed to the side , as the us-led war on terrorism threatens to dominate the group ’ s discussion rounds .
diplomats say senior canadian officials are privately musing whether the g8 has become the g1 , where the united states can do pretty much as it pleases while other nations stand on the sidelines .
" we all fear that this will turn into an ‘ everyone against bush ’ meeting , which is not good news , " one senior g8 diplomat told reuters news agency .
but at a pre-summit meeting with canadian minister jean chrétien on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said g8 leaders are united and share a consensus on supporting joint efforts to ensure that russia ’ s nuclear weapons do not fall into the hands of terrorists .
leaders from canada , italy , france , britain , germany , japan , the us and russia will have two days of talks in the secluded rocky mountain resort to focus on this phase of the american war on terrorism .
ten-year plan on his visit to berlin in may , the american president outlined a ten-year plan to drastically reduce russia ’ s existing nuclear arsenal and provide safe storage for nuclear material .
the plan calls for the united states , and the g8 members collectively , to each contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.3 billion euro -rrb- to the nuclear nonproliferation initiative .
the reduction of atomic missiles is part of the american war on terror .
in the aftermath of the september 11th terrorist attacks , the united states has increased efforts to prevent terrorists from obtaining nuclear , biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction .
the us is concerned that nuclear war heads or nuclear material that could turn conventional explosive devices into " dirty bombs " may fall into the hands of terrorists .
one point of discussion among the g8 leaders will be which nuclear nations should be included in the program .
still , the plan is unlikely to be ready for debate at the kananaskis summit , in part because other countries are reluctant to hand over such large amounts of money , and russia has not made it clear whether it would sign up for the deal .
trade without frontiers in whatever time remains for other issues , participants are expected to discuss the global economy and prospects for economic recovery .
free trade will likely be brought up in president bush ’ s presence .
in pre-summit discussions chancellor schröder and prime minister chrétien also criticized trade subsidies and trade barriers as a major obstacle to free international trade in their monday meeting .
recently imposed us steel tariffs and a farm subsidy plan have caused friction between the us and its european allies .
but the german chancellor downplayed the trade dispute between washington and brussels .
“ the differences will soon be resolved , ” he said .
a new partnership with africa if canadian head of state chrétien has his way , the summit will also take a closer look at developing a new partnership between the g8 nations and africa in terms of financial aid .
chrétien wants the second day of the summit to be devoted to a g8 africa action plan which includes measures to help fight poverty and control the hiv and aids crisis .
the plan calls for an ambitious annual foreign investment of $ 64 billion , more than seven times the total amount of african investment in 1999 .
the plan " will be designed to help african governments that are committed to working with , and on behalf of , all of their citizens , " said chrétien the prime minister emphasized that despite the war on terror and the escalation of hostilities in the middle east , the summit will not diverge from its focus on africa .
however , president bush has not come out with any statements on the topic , and his speech on monday unveiling a new middle east policy could further shift the summit ’ s focus away from africa .
pre-summit schedule after monday ’ s press conference with prime minister chrétien , chancellor schröder spent tuesday in montréal giving a speech before the conférence de montréal , a gathering of high-ranking representatives from the worlds of economics , politics and science .
afterwards schröder visited the canadian rail technology corporation bombardier .
earlier this year , chancellor schröder was instrumental in preventing the closure of the german branch of bombardier in the town of ammendorf in saxony-anhalt .
the plant , in one of germany ’ s weakest economic regions , had been threatened with closure and the loss of some 900 jobs until the chancellor stepped in .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn encourages his team mates in front of a huge south korean flag during their 2002 world cup semifinal soccer match at the seoul world cup stadium in seoul , south korea , tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .
chancellor gerhard schröder was quick with congratulations , and said he hoped for a world cup victory .
his opponent in this september ’ s federal elections , edmund stoiber said the german side had " earned the victory . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of koreans jam the square in front of city hall in seoul , south korea tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
up to three million people were expected to crowd the streets of the city to watch the 2002 world cup semi-final match between south korea and germany on big screens later in the day .
south korea is the first asian team to make the semi-finals of the world cup .
-lrb- ap photo / greg baker -rrb- south korea , which saw its team exceed all expectations by reaching the semifinals , finally came back down to earth .
around 10,000 fans had gathered in the streets outside the stadium before the match , all dressed in the red that has hypnotized so many of their team ’ s opponents during this world cup .

the war on terror will figure high on the agenda at this week 's summit of group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leaders in kananaskis , canada .
other issues like free trade and a aid for africa could be overshadowed . when the group of eight meets for their summit on wednesday and thursday in kananaskis , canada , one of the main topics on the agenda will be helping russia to remove its atomic weapons and safely store the nuclear material .
other issues , such as financial aid to africa , free trade , and the middle east , will most likely be pushed to the side , as the us-led war on terrorism threatens to dominate the group ’ s discussion rounds .
diplomats say senior canadian officials are privately musing whether the g8 has become the g1 , where the united states can do pretty much as it pleases while other nations stand on the sidelines .
" we all fear that this will turn into an ‘ everyone against bush ’ meeting , which is not good news , " one senior g8 diplomat told reuters news agency .
but at a pre-summit meeting with canadian minister jean chrétien on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said g8 leaders are united and share a consensus on supporting joint efforts to ensure that russia ’ s nuclear weapons do not fall into the hands of terrorists .
leaders from canada , italy , france , britain , germany , japan , the us and russia will have two days of talks in the secluded rocky mountain resort to focus on this phase of the american war on terrorism .
ten-year plan on his visit to berlin in may , the american president outlined a ten-year plan to drastically reduce russia ’ s existing nuclear arsenal and provide safe storage for nuclear material .
the plan calls for the united states , and the g8 members collectively , to each contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.3 billion euro -rrb- to the nuclear nonproliferation initiative .
the reduction of atomic missiles is part of the american war on terror .
in the aftermath of the september 11th terrorist attacks , the united states has increased efforts to prevent terrorists from obtaining nuclear , biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction .
the us is concerned that nuclear war heads or nuclear material that could turn conventional explosive devices into " dirty bombs " may fall into the hands of terrorists .
one point of discussion among the g8 leaders will be which nuclear nations should be included in the program .
still , the plan is unlikely to be ready for debate at the kananaskis summit , in part because other countries are reluctant to hand over such large amounts of money , and russia has not made it clear whether it would sign up for the deal .
trade without frontiers in whatever time remains for other issues , participants are expected to discuss the global economy and prospects for economic recovery .
free trade will likely be brought up in president bush ’ s presence .
in pre-summit discussions chancellor schröder and prime minister chrétien also criticized trade subsidies and trade barriers as a major obstacle to free international trade in their monday meeting .
recently imposed us steel tariffs and a farm subsidy plan have caused friction between the us and its european allies .
but the german chancellor downplayed the trade dispute between washington and brussels .
“ the differences will soon be resolved , ” he said .
a new partnership with africa if canadian head of state chrétien has his way , the summit will also take a closer look at developing a new partnership between the g8 nations and africa in terms of financial aid .
chrétien wants the second day of the summit to be devoted to a g8 africa action plan which includes measures to help fight poverty and control the hiv and aids crisis .
the plan calls for an ambitious annual foreign investment of $ 64 billion , more than seven times the total amount of african investment in 1999 .
the plan " will be designed to help african governments that are committed to working with , and on behalf of , all of their citizens , " said chrétien the prime minister emphasized that despite the war on terror and the escalation of hostilities in the middle east , the summit will not diverge from its focus on africa .
however , president bush has not come out with any statements on the topic , and his speech on monday unveiling a new middle east policy could further shift the summit ’ s focus away from africa .
pre-summit schedule after monday ’ s press conference with prime minister chrétien , chancellor schröder spent tuesday in montréal giving a speech before the conférence de montréal , a gathering of high-ranking representatives from the worlds of economics , politics and science .
afterwards schröder visited the canadian rail technology corporation bombardier .
earlier this year , chancellor schröder was instrumental in preventing the closure of the german branch of bombardier in the town of ammendorf in saxony-anhalt .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "

germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.06.2002 everyday isn ’ t christopher street day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is n't only what homosexuality is about csd may have attracted thousands to its glitzy celebrations this year , but homosexual reality is far from colourful .
young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .
attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits enjoyed by straight couples were struck down in the upper house of german parliament last year .
and unlike gay couples in neighbouring holland , german homosexual couples do not have the right to adopt children . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a summer awash in pink while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn encourages his team mates in front of a huge south korean flag during their 2002 world cup semifinal soccer match at the seoul world cup stadium in seoul , south korea , tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .
chancellor gerhard schröder was quick with congratulations , and said he hoped for a world cup victory .
his opponent in this september ’ s federal elections , edmund stoiber said the german side had " earned the victory . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of koreans jam the square in front of city hall in seoul , south korea tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
up to three million people were expected to crowd the streets of the city to watch the 2002 world cup semi-final match between south korea and germany on big screens later in the day .
south korea is the first asian team to make the semi-finals of the world cup .
-lrb- ap photo / greg baker -rrb- south korea , which saw its team exceed all expectations by reaching the semifinals , finally came back down to earth .
around 10,000 fans had gathered in the streets outside the stadium before the match , all dressed in the red that has hypnotized so many of their team ’ s opponents during this world cup .

that 's more bad news for the struggling retail industry , where 150,000 businesses face bankruptcy this year . germany ’ s economic slump has hit private businesses hard and consumer confidence took an unexpected turn for the worst , according to figures released this week .
almost 150,000 private businesses are facing bankruptcy this year due to the country ’ s high unemployment and low confidence in an economic turnaround .
the monday results , from the country ’ s association for german private businesses -lrb- hde -rrb- , came a day before the munich-based ifo institute revealed that consumer confidence had dipped from may to june .
the drop in confidence was directly connected to monday ’ s bad news .
a slump in the construction industry and private businesses were the reasons the confidence index slipped from 91.6 in june to 91.3 in may , according to the ifo figures .
forget that new suit " the consumer is bombarded with bad news , " said hermann franzen , of the hde .
" that 's no atmosphere in which to buy himself a new suit . "
big business doesn ’ t see any reason to be hopeful either .
companies polled by ifo said that they expected the economy to continue its slump .
" the slip is almost completely due to the not so fortunate expectations for the next six months , " hans werner-sin , ifo ’ s president , told reporters .
werner-sin said his institute , among the leading business forecasters in germany , remained optimistic that a turnaround was in sight .
his counterpart at the private business association wasn ’ t too sure .
political action needed franzen said major changes were still needed in germany ’ s labor market and appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government to initiate the structural reforms necessary .
" hope dies at the very end , " he said in a statement .
" business is living almost completely running on hope at the moment .
that ’ s why we hope things will change after the next election . "
germany has about 4 million unemployed at the moment , about 8.5 percent of the population .
that means less money to spend and a worsening prognosis for private business , said franzen .
exactly one third of the private businesses polled by the association are due to report a drop in annual income of 10 percent .
" we have never had such an unfortunate result , " franzen said in a statement .
euro not to blame the results , though , had little to do with the european union ’ s new currency , said franzen .
consumers have been grumbling since the introduction of the euro that private business has used the new currency to raise prices .
" the euro is only a building block for the downward trend , " said holger wenzel of the hde .
bad news for private business will mean good news for consumers , though .
the hde said it expects more sales in the coming months .

forget that new suit " the consumer is bombarded with bad news , " said hermann franzen , of the hde .
" that 's no atmosphere in which to buy himself a new suit . "
big business doesn ’ t see any reason to be hopeful either .
companies polled by ifo said that they expected the economy to continue its slump .
" the slip is almost completely due to the not so fortunate expectations for the next six months , " hans werner-sin , ifo ’ s president , told reporters .
werner-sin said his institute , among the leading business forecasters in germany , remained optimistic that a turnaround was in sight .
his counterpart at the private business association wasn ’ t too sure .
political action needed franzen said major changes were still needed in germany ’ s labor market and appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government to initiate the structural reforms necessary .
" hope dies at the very end , " he said in a statement .
" business is living almost completely running on hope at the moment .
that ’ s why we hope things will change after the next election . "
germany has about 4 million unemployed at the moment , about 8.5 percent of the population .
that means less money to spend and a worsening prognosis for private business , said franzen .
exactly one third of the private businesses polled by the association are due to report a drop in annual income of 10 percent .
" we have never had such an unfortunate result , " franzen said in a statement .
euro not to blame the results , though , had little to do with the european union ’ s new currency , said franzen .
consumers have been grumbling since the introduction of the euro that private business has used the new currency to raise prices .
" the euro is only a building block for the downward trend , " said holger wenzel of the hde .
bad news for private business will mean good news for consumers , though .
the hde said it expects more sales in the coming months .
it might be time to buy that new suit , after all . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .

germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn encourages his team mates in front of a huge south korean flag during their 2002 world cup semifinal soccer match at the seoul world cup stadium in seoul , south korea , tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .
chancellor gerhard schröder was quick with congratulations , and said he hoped for a world cup victory .
his opponent in this september ’ s federal elections , edmund stoiber said the german side had " earned the victory . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of koreans jam the square in front of city hall in seoul , south korea tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
up to three million people were expected to crowd the streets of the city to watch the 2002 world cup semi-final match between south korea and germany on big screens later in the day .
south korea is the first asian team to make the semi-finals of the world cup .
-lrb- ap photo / greg baker -rrb- south korea , which saw its team exceed all expectations by reaching the semifinals , finally came back down to earth .
around 10,000 fans had gathered in the streets outside the stadium before the match , all dressed in the red that has hypnotized so many of their team ’ s opponents during this world cup .
after meier blew the final whistle , the fans continued to cheer their team on even as their dreams of a final lay dashed on the seoul stadium floor . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .
attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits enjoyed by straight couples were struck down in the upper house of german parliament last year .

that 's more bad news for the struggling retail industry , where 150,000 businesses face bankruptcy this year . germany ’ s economic slump has hit private businesses hard and consumer confidence took an unexpected turn for the worst , according to figures released this week .
almost 150,000 private businesses are facing bankruptcy this year due to the country ’ s high unemployment and low confidence in an economic turnaround .
the monday results , from the country ’ s association for german private businesses -lrb- hde -rrb- , came a day before the munich-based ifo institute revealed that consumer confidence had dipped from may to june .
the drop in confidence was directly connected to monday ’ s bad news .
a slump in the construction industry and private businesses were the reasons the confidence index slipped from 91.6 in june to 91.3 in may , according to the ifo figures .
forget that new suit " the consumer is bombarded with bad news , " said hermann franzen , of the hde .
" that 's no atmosphere in which to buy himself a new suit . "
big business doesn ’ t see any reason to be hopeful either .
companies polled by ifo said that they expected the economy to continue its slump .
" the slip is almost completely due to the not so fortunate expectations for the next six months , " hans werner-sin , ifo ’ s president , told reporters .
werner-sin said his institute , among the leading business forecasters in germany , remained optimistic that a turnaround was in sight .
his counterpart at the private business association wasn ’ t too sure .
political action needed franzen said major changes were still needed in germany ’ s labor market and appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government to initiate the structural reforms necessary .
" hope dies at the very end , " he said in a statement .
" business is living almost completely running on hope at the moment .
that ’ s why we hope things will change after the next election . "
germany has about 4 million unemployed at the moment , about 8.5 percent of the population .
that means less money to spend and a worsening prognosis for private business , said franzen .
exactly one third of the private businesses polled by the association are due to report a drop in annual income of 10 percent .
" we have never had such an unfortunate result , " franzen said in a statement .
euro not to blame the results , though , had little to do with the european union ’ s new currency , said franzen .
consumers have been grumbling since the introduction of the euro that private business has used the new currency to raise prices .
" the euro is only a building block for the downward trend , " said holger wenzel of the hde .
bad news for private business will mean good news for consumers , though .
the hde said it expects more sales in the coming months .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn encourages his team mates in front of a huge south korean flag during their 2002 world cup semifinal soccer match at the seoul world cup stadium in seoul , south korea , tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .
chancellor gerhard schröder was quick with congratulations , and said he hoped for a world cup victory .
his opponent in this september ’ s federal elections , edmund stoiber said the german side had " earned the victory . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of koreans jam the square in front of city hall in seoul , south korea tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
up to three million people were expected to crowd the streets of the city to watch the 2002 world cup semi-final match between south korea and germany on big screens later in the day .
south korea is the first asian team to make the semi-finals of the world cup .
-lrb- ap photo / greg baker -rrb- south korea , which saw its team exceed all expectations by reaching the semifinals , finally came back down to earth .
around 10,000 fans had gathered in the streets outside the stadium before the match , all dressed in the red that has hypnotized so many of their team ’ s opponents during this world cup .

young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .

germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .

klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn encourages his team mates in front of a huge south korean flag during their 2002 world cup semifinal soccer match at the seoul world cup stadium in seoul , south korea , tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .
chancellor gerhard schröder was quick with congratulations , and said he hoped for a world cup victory .
his opponent in this september ’ s federal elections , edmund stoiber said the german side had " earned the victory . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of koreans jam the square in front of city hall in seoul , south korea tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
up to three million people were expected to crowd the streets of the city to watch the 2002 world cup semi-final match between south korea and germany on big screens later in the day .
south korea is the first asian team to make the semi-finals of the world cup .
-lrb- ap photo / greg baker -rrb- south korea , which saw its team exceed all expectations by reaching the semifinals , finally came back down to earth .
around 10,000 fans had gathered in the streets outside the stadium before the match , all dressed in the red that has hypnotized so many of their team ’ s opponents during this world cup .
after meier blew the final whistle , the fans continued to cheer their team on even as their dreams of a final lay dashed on the seoul stadium floor . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .
attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits enjoyed by straight couples were struck down in the upper house of german parliament last year .

the war on terror will figure high on the agenda at this week 's summit of group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leaders in kananaskis , canada .
other issues like free trade and a aid for africa could be overshadowed . when the group of eight meets for their summit on wednesday and thursday in kananaskis , canada , one of the main topics on the agenda will be helping russia to remove its atomic weapons and safely store the nuclear material .
other issues , such as financial aid to africa , free trade , and the middle east , will most likely be pushed to the side , as the us-led war on terrorism threatens to dominate the group ’ s discussion rounds .
diplomats say senior canadian officials are privately musing whether the g8 has become the g1 , where the united states can do pretty much as it pleases while other nations stand on the sidelines .
" we all fear that this will turn into an ‘ everyone against bush ’ meeting , which is not good news , " one senior g8 diplomat told reuters news agency .
but at a pre-summit meeting with canadian minister jean chrétien on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said g8 leaders are united and share a consensus on supporting joint efforts to ensure that russia ’ s nuclear weapons do not fall into the hands of terrorists .
leaders from canada , italy , france , britain , germany , japan , the us and russia will have two days of talks in the secluded rocky mountain resort to focus on this phase of the american war on terrorism .
ten-year plan on his visit to berlin in may , the american president outlined a ten-year plan to drastically reduce russia ’ s existing nuclear arsenal and provide safe storage for nuclear material .
the plan calls for the united states , and the g8 members collectively , to each contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.3 billion euro -rrb- to the nuclear nonproliferation initiative .
the reduction of atomic missiles is part of the american war on terror .
in the aftermath of the september 11th terrorist attacks , the united states has increased efforts to prevent terrorists from obtaining nuclear , biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction .
the us is concerned that nuclear war heads or nuclear material that could turn conventional explosive devices into " dirty bombs " may fall into the hands of terrorists .
one point of discussion among the g8 leaders will be which nuclear nations should be included in the program .
still , the plan is unlikely to be ready for debate at the kananaskis summit , in part because other countries are reluctant to hand over such large amounts of money , and russia has not made it clear whether it would sign up for the deal .
trade without frontiers in whatever time remains for other issues , participants are expected to discuss the global economy and prospects for economic recovery .
free trade will likely be brought up in president bush ’ s presence .
in pre-summit discussions chancellor schröder and prime minister chrétien also criticized trade subsidies and trade barriers as a major obstacle to free international trade in their monday meeting .
recently imposed us steel tariffs and a farm subsidy plan have caused friction between the us and its european allies .
but the german chancellor downplayed the trade dispute between washington and brussels .
“ the differences will soon be resolved , ” he said .
a new partnership with africa if canadian head of state chrétien has his way , the summit will also take a closer look at developing a new partnership between the g8 nations and africa in terms of financial aid .
chrétien wants the second day of the summit to be devoted to a g8 africa action plan which includes measures to help fight poverty and control the hiv and aids crisis .
the plan calls for an ambitious annual foreign investment of $ 64 billion , more than seven times the total amount of african investment in 1999 .
the plan " will be designed to help african governments that are committed to working with , and on behalf of , all of their citizens , " said chrétien the prime minister emphasized that despite the war on terror and the escalation of hostilities in the middle east , the summit will not diverge from its focus on africa .
however , president bush has not come out with any statements on the topic , and his speech on monday unveiling a new middle east policy could further shift the summit ’ s focus away from africa .
pre-summit schedule after monday ’ s press conference with prime minister chrétien , chancellor schröder spent tuesday in montréal giving a speech before the conférence de montréal , a gathering of high-ranking representatives from the worlds of economics , politics and science .
afterwards schröder visited the canadian rail technology corporation bombardier .
earlier this year , chancellor schröder was instrumental in preventing the closure of the german branch of bombardier in the town of ammendorf in saxony-anhalt .
the plant , in one of germany ’ s weakest economic regions , had been threatened with closure and the loss of some 900 jobs until the chancellor stepped in .

the war on terror will figure high on the agenda at this week 's summit of group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leaders in kananaskis , canada .
other issues like free trade and a aid for africa could be overshadowed . when the group of eight meets for their summit on wednesday and thursday in kananaskis , canada , one of the main topics on the agenda will be helping russia to remove its atomic weapons and safely store the nuclear material .
other issues , such as financial aid to africa , free trade , and the middle east , will most likely be pushed to the side , as the us-led war on terrorism threatens to dominate the group ’ s discussion rounds .
diplomats say senior canadian officials are privately musing whether the g8 has become the g1 , where the united states can do pretty much as it pleases while other nations stand on the sidelines .
" we all fear that this will turn into an ‘ everyone against bush ’ meeting , which is not good news , " one senior g8 diplomat told reuters news agency .
but at a pre-summit meeting with canadian minister jean chrétien on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said g8 leaders are united and share a consensus on supporting joint efforts to ensure that russia ’ s nuclear weapons do not fall into the hands of terrorists .
leaders from canada , italy , france , britain , germany , japan , the us and russia will have two days of talks in the secluded rocky mountain resort to focus on this phase of the american war on terrorism .
ten-year plan on his visit to berlin in may , the american president outlined a ten-year plan to drastically reduce russia ’ s existing nuclear arsenal and provide safe storage for nuclear material .
the plan calls for the united states , and the g8 members collectively , to each contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.3 billion euro -rrb- to the nuclear nonproliferation initiative .
the reduction of atomic missiles is part of the american war on terror .
in the aftermath of the september 11th terrorist attacks , the united states has increased efforts to prevent terrorists from obtaining nuclear , biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction .
the us is concerned that nuclear war heads or nuclear material that could turn conventional explosive devices into " dirty bombs " may fall into the hands of terrorists .
one point of discussion among the g8 leaders will be which nuclear nations should be included in the program .
still , the plan is unlikely to be ready for debate at the kananaskis summit , in part because other countries are reluctant to hand over such large amounts of money , and russia has not made it clear whether it would sign up for the deal .
trade without frontiers in whatever time remains for other issues , participants are expected to discuss the global economy and prospects for economic recovery .
free trade will likely be brought up in president bush ’ s presence .
in pre-summit discussions chancellor schröder and prime minister chrétien also criticized trade subsidies and trade barriers as a major obstacle to free international trade in their monday meeting .
recently imposed us steel tariffs and a farm subsidy plan have caused friction between the us and its european allies .
but the german chancellor downplayed the trade dispute between washington and brussels .
“ the differences will soon be resolved , ” he said .
a new partnership with africa if canadian head of state chrétien has his way , the summit will also take a closer look at developing a new partnership between the g8 nations and africa in terms of financial aid .
chrétien wants the second day of the summit to be devoted to a g8 africa action plan which includes measures to help fight poverty and control the hiv and aids crisis .
the plan calls for an ambitious annual foreign investment of $ 64 billion , more than seven times the total amount of african investment in 1999 .
the plan " will be designed to help african governments that are committed to working with , and on behalf of , all of their citizens , " said chrétien the prime minister emphasized that despite the war on terror and the escalation of hostilities in the middle east , the summit will not diverge from its focus on africa .
however , president bush has not come out with any statements on the topic , and his speech on monday unveiling a new middle east policy could further shift the summit ’ s focus away from africa .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "

germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .

that 's more bad news for the struggling retail industry , where 150,000 businesses face bankruptcy this year . germany ’ s economic slump has hit private businesses hard and consumer confidence took an unexpected turn for the worst , according to figures released this week .
almost 150,000 private businesses are facing bankruptcy this year due to the country ’ s high unemployment and low confidence in an economic turnaround .
the monday results , from the country ’ s association for german private businesses -lrb- hde -rrb- , came a day before the munich-based ifo institute revealed that consumer confidence had dipped from may to june .
the drop in confidence was directly connected to monday ’ s bad news .
a slump in the construction industry and private businesses were the reasons the confidence index slipped from 91.6 in june to 91.3 in may , according to the ifo figures .
forget that new suit " the consumer is bombarded with bad news , " said hermann franzen , of the hde .
" that 's no atmosphere in which to buy himself a new suit . "
big business doesn ’ t see any reason to be hopeful either .
companies polled by ifo said that they expected the economy to continue its slump .
" the slip is almost completely due to the not so fortunate expectations for the next six months , " hans werner-sin , ifo ’ s president , told reporters .
werner-sin said his institute , among the leading business forecasters in germany , remained optimistic that a turnaround was in sight .
his counterpart at the private business association wasn ’ t too sure .
political action needed franzen said major changes were still needed in germany ’ s labor market and appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government to initiate the structural reforms necessary .
" hope dies at the very end , " he said in a statement .
" business is living almost completely running on hope at the moment .
that ’ s why we hope things will change after the next election . "
germany has about 4 million unemployed at the moment , about 8.5 percent of the population .
that means less money to spend and a worsening prognosis for private business , said franzen .
exactly one third of the private businesses polled by the association are due to report a drop in annual income of 10 percent .
" we have never had such an unfortunate result , " franzen said in a statement .
euro not to blame the results , though , had little to do with the european union ’ s new currency , said franzen .
consumers have been grumbling since the introduction of the euro that private business has used the new currency to raise prices .
" the euro is only a building block for the downward trend , " said holger wenzel of the hde .
bad news for private business will mean good news for consumers , though .

the war on terror will figure high on the agenda at this week 's summit of group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leaders in kananaskis , canada .
other issues like free trade and a aid for africa could be overshadowed . when the group of eight meets for their summit on wednesday and thursday in kananaskis , canada , one of the main topics on the agenda will be helping russia to remove its atomic weapons and safely store the nuclear material .
other issues , such as financial aid to africa , free trade , and the middle east , will most likely be pushed to the side , as the us-led war on terrorism threatens to dominate the group ’ s discussion rounds .
diplomats say senior canadian officials are privately musing whether the g8 has become the g1 , where the united states can do pretty much as it pleases while other nations stand on the sidelines .
" we all fear that this will turn into an ‘ everyone against bush ’ meeting , which is not good news , " one senior g8 diplomat told reuters news agency .
but at a pre-summit meeting with canadian minister jean chrétien on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said g8 leaders are united and share a consensus on supporting joint efforts to ensure that russia ’ s nuclear weapons do not fall into the hands of terrorists .
leaders from canada , italy , france , britain , germany , japan , the us and russia will have two days of talks in the secluded rocky mountain resort to focus on this phase of the american war on terrorism .
ten-year plan on his visit to berlin in may , the american president outlined a ten-year plan to drastically reduce russia ’ s existing nuclear arsenal and provide safe storage for nuclear material .
the plan calls for the united states , and the g8 members collectively , to each contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.3 billion euro -rrb- to the nuclear nonproliferation initiative .
the reduction of atomic missiles is part of the american war on terror .
in the aftermath of the september 11th terrorist attacks , the united states has increased efforts to prevent terrorists from obtaining nuclear , biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction .
the us is concerned that nuclear war heads or nuclear material that could turn conventional explosive devices into " dirty bombs " may fall into the hands of terrorists .
one point of discussion among the g8 leaders will be which nuclear nations should be included in the program .
still , the plan is unlikely to be ready for debate at the kananaskis summit , in part because other countries are reluctant to hand over such large amounts of money , and russia has not made it clear whether it would sign up for the deal .
trade without frontiers in whatever time remains for other issues , participants are expected to discuss the global economy and prospects for economic recovery .
free trade will likely be brought up in president bush ’ s presence .
in pre-summit discussions chancellor schröder and prime minister chrétien also criticized trade subsidies and trade barriers as a major obstacle to free international trade in their monday meeting .
recently imposed us steel tariffs and a farm subsidy plan have caused friction between the us and its european allies .
but the german chancellor downplayed the trade dispute between washington and brussels .
“ the differences will soon be resolved , ” he said .
a new partnership with africa if canadian head of state chrétien has his way , the summit will also take a closer look at developing a new partnership between the g8 nations and africa in terms of financial aid .
chrétien wants the second day of the summit to be devoted to a g8 africa action plan which includes measures to help fight poverty and control the hiv and aids crisis .
the plan calls for an ambitious annual foreign investment of $ 64 billion , more than seven times the total amount of african investment in 1999 .
the plan " will be designed to help african governments that are committed to working with , and on behalf of , all of their citizens , " said chrétien the prime minister emphasized that despite the war on terror and the escalation of hostilities in the middle east , the summit will not diverge from its focus on africa .
however , president bush has not come out with any statements on the topic , and his speech on monday unveiling a new middle east policy could further shift the summit ’ s focus away from africa .
pre-summit schedule after monday ’ s press conference with prime minister chrétien , chancellor schröder spent tuesday in montréal giving a speech before the conférence de montréal , a gathering of high-ranking representatives from the worlds of economics , politics and science .
afterwards schröder visited the canadian rail technology corporation bombardier .
earlier this year , chancellor schröder was instrumental in preventing the closure of the german branch of bombardier in the town of ammendorf in saxony-anhalt .
the plant , in one of germany ’ s weakest economic regions , had been threatened with closure and the loss of some 900 jobs until the chancellor stepped in .

the war on terror will figure high on the agenda at this week 's summit of group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- leaders in kananaskis , canada .
other issues like free trade and a aid for africa could be overshadowed . when the group of eight meets for their summit on wednesday and thursday in kananaskis , canada , one of the main topics on the agenda will be helping russia to remove its atomic weapons and safely store the nuclear material .
other issues , such as financial aid to africa , free trade , and the middle east , will most likely be pushed to the side , as the us-led war on terrorism threatens to dominate the group ’ s discussion rounds .
diplomats say senior canadian officials are privately musing whether the g8 has become the g1 , where the united states can do pretty much as it pleases while other nations stand on the sidelines .
" we all fear that this will turn into an ‘ everyone against bush ’ meeting , which is not good news , " one senior g8 diplomat told reuters news agency .
but at a pre-summit meeting with canadian minister jean chrétien on monday , german chancellor gerhard schröder said g8 leaders are united and share a consensus on supporting joint efforts to ensure that russia ’ s nuclear weapons do not fall into the hands of terrorists .
leaders from canada , italy , france , britain , germany , japan , the us and russia will have two days of talks in the secluded rocky mountain resort to focus on this phase of the american war on terrorism .
ten-year plan on his visit to berlin in may , the american president outlined a ten-year plan to drastically reduce russia ’ s existing nuclear arsenal and provide safe storage for nuclear material .
the plan calls for the united states , and the g8 members collectively , to each contribute $ 10 billion -lrb- 10.3 billion euro -rrb- to the nuclear nonproliferation initiative .
the reduction of atomic missiles is part of the american war on terror .
in the aftermath of the september 11th terrorist attacks , the united states has increased efforts to prevent terrorists from obtaining nuclear , biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction .
the us is concerned that nuclear war heads or nuclear material that could turn conventional explosive devices into " dirty bombs " may fall into the hands of terrorists .
one point of discussion among the g8 leaders will be which nuclear nations should be included in the program .
still , the plan is unlikely to be ready for debate at the kananaskis summit , in part because other countries are reluctant to hand over such large amounts of money , and russia has not made it clear whether it would sign up for the deal .
trade without frontiers in whatever time remains for other issues , participants are expected to discuss the global economy and prospects for economic recovery .
free trade will likely be brought up in president bush ’ s presence .
in pre-summit discussions chancellor schröder and prime minister chrétien also criticized trade subsidies and trade barriers as a major obstacle to free international trade in their monday meeting .
recently imposed us steel tariffs and a farm subsidy plan have caused friction between the us and its european allies .
but the german chancellor downplayed the trade dispute between washington and brussels .
“ the differences will soon be resolved , ” he said .
a new partnership with africa if canadian head of state chrétien has his way , the summit will also take a closer look at developing a new partnership between the g8 nations and africa in terms of financial aid .
chrétien wants the second day of the summit to be devoted to a g8 africa action plan which includes measures to help fight poverty and control the hiv and aids crisis .
the plan calls for an ambitious annual foreign investment of $ 64 billion , more than seven times the total amount of african investment in 1999 .
the plan " will be designed to help african governments that are committed to working with , and on behalf of , all of their citizens , " said chrétien the prime minister emphasized that despite the war on terror and the escalation of hostilities in the middle east , the summit will not diverge from its focus on africa .
however , president bush has not come out with any statements on the topic , and his speech on monday unveiling a new middle east policy could further shift the summit ’ s focus away from africa .
pre-summit schedule after monday ’ s press conference with prime minister chrétien , chancellor schröder spent tuesday in montréal giving a speech before the conférence de montréal , a gathering of high-ranking representatives from the worlds of economics , politics and science .
afterwards schröder visited the canadian rail technology corporation bombardier .
earlier this year , chancellor schröder was instrumental in preventing the closure of the german branch of bombardier in the town of ammendorf in saxony-anhalt .
the plant , in one of germany ’ s weakest economic regions , had been threatened with closure and the loss of some 900 jobs until the chancellor stepped in .
the chancellor will arrive at kananaskis on tuesday night where conference participants will get together for informal talks before the official opening on wednesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .
attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits enjoyed by straight couples were struck down in the upper house of german parliament last year .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .

the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .

kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .

kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .
chancellor gerhard schröder was quick with congratulations , and said he hoped for a world cup victory .
his opponent in this september ’ s federal elections , edmund stoiber said the german side had " earned the victory . "

young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .
attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits enjoyed by straight couples were struck down in the upper house of german parliament last year .

that 's more bad news for the struggling retail industry , where 150,000 businesses face bankruptcy this year . germany ’ s economic slump has hit private businesses hard and consumer confidence took an unexpected turn for the worst , according to figures released this week .
almost 150,000 private businesses are facing bankruptcy this year due to the country ’ s high unemployment and low confidence in an economic turnaround .
the monday results , from the country ’ s association for german private businesses -lrb- hde -rrb- , came a day before the munich-based ifo institute revealed that consumer confidence had dipped from may to june .
the drop in confidence was directly connected to monday ’ s bad news .
a slump in the construction industry and private businesses were the reasons the confidence index slipped from 91.6 in june to 91.3 in may , according to the ifo figures .
forget that new suit " the consumer is bombarded with bad news , " said hermann franzen , of the hde .
" that 's no atmosphere in which to buy himself a new suit . "
big business doesn ’ t see any reason to be hopeful either .
companies polled by ifo said that they expected the economy to continue its slump .
" the slip is almost completely due to the not so fortunate expectations for the next six months , " hans werner-sin , ifo ’ s president , told reporters .
werner-sin said his institute , among the leading business forecasters in germany , remained optimistic that a turnaround was in sight .
his counterpart at the private business association wasn ’ t too sure .

" hope dies at the very end , " he said in a statement .
" business is living almost completely running on hope at the moment .
that ’ s why we hope things will change after the next election . "
germany has about 4 million unemployed at the moment , about 8.5 percent of the population .
that means less money to spend and a worsening prognosis for private business , said franzen .
exactly one third of the private businesses polled by the association are due to report a drop in annual income of 10 percent .
" we have never had such an unfortunate result , " franzen said in a statement .
euro not to blame the results , though , had little to do with the european union ’ s new currency , said franzen .
consumers have been grumbling since the introduction of the euro that private business has used the new currency to raise prices .
" the euro is only a building block for the downward trend , " said holger wenzel of the hde .

young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .
attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits enjoyed by straight couples were struck down in the upper house of german parliament last year .
and unlike gay couples in neighbouring holland , german homosexual couples do not have the right to adopt children . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a summer awash in pink while politicians meet in brussels to flesh out the future of europe , a european summit of quite a different kind convenes in cologne : europride , the old country 's gigantic gay-lesbian fest kicks off this week .

that 's more bad news for the struggling retail industry , where 150,000 businesses face bankruptcy this year . germany ’ s economic slump has hit private businesses hard and consumer confidence took an unexpected turn for the worst , according to figures released this week .
almost 150,000 private businesses are facing bankruptcy this year due to the country ’ s high unemployment and low confidence in an economic turnaround .
the monday results , from the country ’ s association for german private businesses -lrb- hde -rrb- , came a day before the munich-based ifo institute revealed that consumer confidence had dipped from may to june .
the drop in confidence was directly connected to monday ’ s bad news .
a slump in the construction industry and private businesses were the reasons the confidence index slipped from 91.6 in june to 91.3 in may , according to the ifo figures .
forget that new suit " the consumer is bombarded with bad news , " said hermann franzen , of the hde .
" that 's no atmosphere in which to buy himself a new suit . "
big business doesn ’ t see any reason to be hopeful either .
companies polled by ifo said that they expected the economy to continue its slump .
" the slip is almost completely due to the not so fortunate expectations for the next six months , " hans werner-sin , ifo ’ s president , told reporters .
werner-sin said his institute , among the leading business forecasters in germany , remained optimistic that a turnaround was in sight .
his counterpart at the private business association wasn ’ t too sure .
political action needed franzen said major changes were still needed in germany ’ s labor market and appealed to chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government to initiate the structural reforms necessary .
" hope dies at the very end , " he said in a statement .
" business is living almost completely running on hope at the moment .
that ’ s why we hope things will change after the next election . "
germany has about 4 million unemployed at the moment , about 8.5 percent of the population .
that means less money to spend and a worsening prognosis for private business , said franzen .
exactly one third of the private businesses polled by the association are due to report a drop in annual income of 10 percent .
" we have never had such an unfortunate result , " franzen said in a statement .
euro not to blame the results , though , had little to do with the european union ’ s new currency , said franzen .
consumers have been grumbling since the introduction of the euro that private business has used the new currency to raise prices .
" the euro is only a building block for the downward trend , " said holger wenzel of the hde .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "

germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .

germany wasn ’ t supposed to go this far .
injured starters , a difficult qualifying round and the lack of a obvious goal-scorer were supposed to doom the german side to the round of 16 in this year ’ s world cup at best .
world cup dreaming was supposed to take place in 2006 , when the tournament came to germany .
yet there they stood , hugging and crying as the around 1,000 german fans in the packed seoul stadium outcheered the 64,000-strong south korean fans for the first time in the game 's 93 minutes .
germany , with a 1-0 victory over upstart south korea , is heading to the world cup final .
the difference was scored by midfielder michael ballack in the 75th minute .
the injury-plagued ballack took a nice cross from oliver neuville as he charged into the box .
he struck with his right foot , was blocked by south korea ’ s jae woon lee , and then put the rebound in the back of the net with the other foot .
the score was the reward of one of the most aggressive games germany has played in this world cup .
germany spent a great amount of time in the south korean side of the field , pulling midfield and defender christoph metzelder forward to increase their size advantage .
taking advantage of korean fatigue the relentless attack was the result of thorough research before the game , said captain oliver kahn .
" we saw that from game to game they lost something , " said the goalkeeper .
" we knew that if we stayed halfway together , it would be enough . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german captain and goalkeeper oliver kahn encourages his team mates in front of a huge south korean flag during their 2002 world cup semifinal soccer match at the seoul world cup stadium in seoul , south korea , tuesday june 25 , 2002 .
germany did have to rely on kahn ’ s spectacular goal keeping at least once .
in the 8th minute the keeper made a diving one-handed save to his right on a powerfully struck ball from korea ’ s soo chun lee .
kahn kept his trademark aggresiveness throughout the game , charging out from the goal to stifle the speedy south korean attack .
defense steps up but kahn could rely on his defenders a lot more than in the usa match , where he withstood and onslaught of shots .
christoph metzelder , the 21-year-old yearling who stepped in when injuries struck the german side before the cup began continued the fantastic tournament he ’ s had .
metzelder not only used his size to stop korean attackers on defense , he also showed some offensive prowess , setting up decent chances in the first half .
" the secret of our success today was the four-man backfield , " metzelder said .
" we fought hard . "
referee urs meier , closely watched after accusations that fifa referees were favoring the korean team , was restrained in his whistle-blowing .
he gave out only three yellow cards , but one of them was to ballack who , following his yellow in the usa game must sit out the final .
it ’ s still too early to tell how the absence of germany ’ s play-making star will hurt the team .
for now , though , germany is celebrating its unexpected final appearance , where it will face either brazil or turkey .
celebrations in germany thousands of fans celebrated across germany .
traffic came to a standstill in berlin ’ s shopping district , the kufürstendamm , as hundreds of fans walked through the streets waving german flags .
chancellor gerhard schröder was quick with congratulations , and said he hoped for a world cup victory .
his opponent in this september ’ s federal elections , edmund stoiber said the german side had " earned the victory . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.06.2002 germany has the shopping blues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting for the sales to arrive in german stores figures released on tuesday said german consumer confidence remained low .
that 's more bad news for the struggling retail industry , where 150,000 businesses face bankruptcy this year . germany ’ s economic slump has hit private businesses hard and consumer confidence took an unexpected turn for the worst , according to figures released this week .
almost 150,000 private businesses are facing bankruptcy this year due to the country ’ s high unemployment and low confidence in an economic turnaround .
the monday results , from the country ’ s association for german private businesses -lrb- hde -rrb- , came a day before the munich-based ifo institute revealed that consumer confidence had dipped from may to june .
the drop in confidence was directly connected to monday ’ s bad news .
a slump in the construction industry and private businesses were the reasons the confidence index slipped from 91.6 in june to 91.3 in may , according to the ifo figures .
forget that new suit " the consumer is bombarded with bad news , " said hermann franzen , of the hde .
" that 's no atmosphere in which to buy himself a new suit . "

that 's more bad news for the struggling retail industry , where 150,000 businesses face bankruptcy this year . germany ’ s economic slump has hit private businesses hard and consumer confidence took an unexpected turn for the worst , according to figures released this week .
almost 150,000 private businesses are facing bankruptcy this year due to the country ’ s high unemployment and low confidence in an economic turnaround .
the monday results , from the country ’ s association for german private businesses -lrb- hde -rrb- , came a day before the munich-based ifo institute revealed that consumer confidence had dipped from may to june .
the drop in confidence was directly connected to monday ’ s bad news .
a slump in the construction industry and private businesses were the reasons the confidence index slipped from 91.6 in june to 91.3 in may , according to the ifo figures .
forget that new suit " the consumer is bombarded with bad news , " said hermann franzen , of the hde .
" that 's no atmosphere in which to buy himself a new suit . "
big business doesn ’ t see any reason to be hopeful either .

young gays and lesbians in germany still face social discrimination , says a recent study . pink wigs , feather boas , fake lashes , leather pants and glitter on naked skin – berlin was transformed into a garish spectacle of body-worshippers , drag queens , and homosexuals cheering and swaying to the music on christopher street day on saturday .
but away from the excessive partying and uninhibited display of gay pride at homosexual festivities , young gays and lesbians in germany often face discriminatory attitudes and deeply-entrenched prejudices .
this has been reinforced by a recent study published by the lower saxony ministry for women , work and social affairs .
loneliness and fear of rejection overshadow " coming-out " phase the study concludes that most homosexual youth suffer from loneliness and severe identity problems in the crucial " coming-out " phase between the ages of 14 and 17 , when consciousness about one ’ s homosexuality sets in .
the discovery of one ’ s homosexuality involves the the same kind of insecurity and fear as was the case 30 years ago , the study reports .
as both homosexual girls and boys find it difficult to openly admit their sexuality and find their way in life during this period , experimenting with sex and love relationships begins on average at the age of 19,3 – 2,5 years later than among heterosexual youth .
the study points that a lack of acceptance of homosexuality in society is the main reason why almost half the gays and lesbians interviewed between the ages of 15 and 25 are afraid to reveal their true sexual orientation to their fathers .
among those who do disclose their homosexuality , over a quarter were never accepted by their fathers .
targets of ridicule and jokes the survey also found that homosexual students are often the target of mean jokes , clichés and disrespectful comments in school .
more than half the youth questioned in the lower saxony study admitted to being ridiculed by their peers and abandoned by friends .
about 11 percent said that they had experienced one or more instances of sexual violence .
the most frequent problems listed by those questioned included partnership and love problems , loneliness , worries about aids , getting to know other homosexuals , dissatisfaction with their sex lives and coming out to their families .
homosexuality not dealt with in schools klaus jetz , the press spokesperson of the lesbian and gay federation in germany -lrb- lsvd -rrb- told dw-world that much more needs to be done in german schools to bring about more tolerance for homosexual students .
" homosexuality is not given the same importance as heterosexuality in biology and sex education class in schools " , he alleges .
heiko kleyböcker , the head of the youth network lambda berlin - which offers counselling and a hotline service for young gays , lesbians and bisexuals - agrees .
" several teachers , especially the male ones are reluctant to address the topic of homosexuality in the classroom , for fear of being labelled a ' gay " ' , he told dw-world .
berlin introduced new legislation on may 1 this year , which mandates that homosexuality as heterosexuality should be dealt with in the same way in sex education classes .
however , few schools follow the new rules , he says .
older homosexuals feel discriminated too klaus jetz says that it ’ s not just young gays and lesbians that face discrimination , but also older ones .
" the youth cult is very dominant in the homosexual scene " , he says .
the display of predominantly young , naked and well-toned skin at the christopher street day parades are proof of that .
much of the gay and lesbian infrastructure in big cities tends to cater to young homosexuals . as a result older homosexuals feel isolated , he says .
media tends to send out the wrong message a further problem , says heiko kleyböcker , is the way the media tends to seize upon images of young outrageously dressed and garishly made-up gays in drag strutting at parades and parties .
by constantly flashing these colourful images at the world at the mere mention of homosexuality , the media ends up distorting the image of gays and lesbians , most of whom look , dress and act like any other heterosexual person .
they also cater to wide-spread societal clichés about homosexuality .
at the same time , kleyböcker says that the images are important to show homosexuality in all its variety .
" it 's important that the general public see how free a man can feel in women 's clothes .
but i agree that there should n't be just a overdose of such pictures , rather a balance " .
some progress in homosexual rights , more to go germany has come a long way since the time when homosexuals were persecuted and jailed by the national socialists during the nazi reign .
gay campaigners rejoiced when on august 1 , 2001 , germany joined the ranks of countries such as holland and sweden when it passed a law approving same-sex marriages .
germany ’ s version of gay marriage gives homosexual couples the same inheritance and tenants ’ rights as heterosexual couples .
it also gives a foreign spouse in a same-sex marriage the right to gain german citizenship .
klaus jetz of the lsvd calls the gay marriage law a " milestone " , but says that much more legislation is needed to complete the process of equal legal rights for gays and lesbians .
more is needed particularly in the fields of taxation and adoption rights .
attempts to give same-sex partners the same tax and welfare benefits enjoyed by straight couples were struck down in the upper house of german parliament last year .

shadow health secretary dr liam fox used a keynote speech on tuesday to say the care in the community policy - introduced by the tories - has gone too far and is a threat to patients and the public .
he told guests at the second conservative mental health summit that the policy is discredited and needs to be overhauled .
care in the community has been discredited in the public mind by a series of crimes committed by the mentally ill dr liam fox shadow health secretary the speech is the latest move by the tories to spell out an alternative health policy and comes ahead of an expected government announcement on a new mental health bill later this week .
dr fox called for mentally ill patients to receive more appropriate care .

shadow health secretary dr liam fox used a keynote speech on tuesday to say the care in the community policy - introduced by the tories - has gone too far and is a threat to patients and the public .
he told guests at the second conservative mental health summit that the policy is discredited and needs to be overhauled . "

mr blair has given his backing to a £ 4bn plan to rescue the world 's poorest countries .
in the past , mr blair has promised to heal the " scar " of african poverty and - on a visit there earlier this year - he pledged a " new start " for the continent .
but his cash call is believed to have met stiff opposition in washington and tokyo .
top of the agenda us president george w bush has already offered a $ 5bn boost in us foreign aid from 2004 , if developing countries pledge to respect human rights and root out corruption .
canada and the uk have been pushing for the eu and us to come up with half of the extra £ 8bn aid they jointly pledged at a un conference earlier this year .
negotiations between uk officials and the white house are reported to have been going on right up to the last minute in an effort to secure the best deal for africa .
but it is thought washington is reluctant to commit further funds and will want to spend its foreign aid unilaterally , rather than committing itself to a joint programme .
meanwhile , japan is scaling back its foreign aid programme in the teeth of a domestic recession .
tony blair has promised african aid will be at the top of the agenda when the leaders of the world 's most powerful countries meet in kananaskis .
he has thrown his weight behind a so-called marshall plan for africa , named after the us programme that helped rebuild europe after the devastation of the second world war .
under the new partnership for africa 's development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , countries will get aid and investment in return for better governance .

earlier this year scottish education minister cathy jamieson called for a national debate on the future of education .
this week on bbc radio scotland 's good morning scotland programme and on bbc news online , i will be looking at key aspects of the education system north of the border .
the first question addressed , on tuesday , is that of exams and whether or not the pressure for success is a driving force in the system .
even before they sit their first external exams - traditionally the standard grade in s4 - pupils these days have already been tested frequently to check their progress through the 5-14 curriculum .
cathy jamieson launched the consultation in all schools in edinburgh , pupils are assessed in maths and english twice at the end of s2 .
the first test is to satisfy scottish executive needs , while the second is an independent test that the local council regards as a more reliable benchmark of pupil ability .
the pressure to achieve is constantly in the background for pupils , teachers and schools .
but the scottish parent teacher council is concerned that exams are driving forward the education system .
they fear that instead of gaining a solid education in their subjects , pupils can end up being coached to pass tests .
they are concerned , too , that too much emphasis on passing exams can leave some less able pupils feeling like failures .
flexibility is the buzz-word in today 's constantly changing world and for many within the education sector , it is regarded as key to the future of learning and teaching the higher still programme saw the introduction of new national qualifications to suit a range of abilities , from access and intermediate to higher and advanced higher .
combined with greater flexibility in the curriculum , it has led to more schools mixing and matching exams to the needs of their pupils .
at the eis union conference in dundee earlier this month , it became clear that the practice has already become widespread .
at firrhill high school in edinburgh they have dropped standard grade in 12 subjects and replaced it with the new intermediate two exam .
the headteacher , pat cairns , believes the content of some of the standard grades is now too dated .
not surprising , when you realise that they replaced the ' o ' grade 20 years ago .
some people want greater flexibility the school has stuck with standard grade in the maths department .
but that too has been adapted to their own needs .
what started as an experiment involving 60 pupils three years ago has now led to all pupils starting their standard grade maths course a year early , in s2 .
by the time they have reached s4 , pupils have not only finished the standard grade , but also completed one component of higher maths .
the results are good , with pupils performing as well and in many cases better than those who took the traditional learning timetable .
perhaps more importantly , though , it eliminates the effect of the ' two-term-dash ' where pupils are under pressure to complete their entire higher studies in two-thirds of the academic year , ahead of study leave and , of course , the exams .
challenging our attitudes flexibility is the buzz-word in today 's constantly changing world and for many within the education sector , it is regarded as key to the future of learning and teaching .
for some , that means radical thinking and a departure from the traditional education methods .
roy jobson , director of education at edinburgh city council believes that as the system becomes more focused on the learner , the time will come when pupils will sit their exams whenever they are ready , much like a driving test .
exams will always have a place within the education system , but for many the question is exactly where that place should be .
changing the emphasis we place on results means challenging our attitudes towards the purpose of education and asking whether good grades are always the most important outcome for our pupils .

the deal , the biggest trade sale in australian history , gives the southern cross consortium full control of sydney airport corporations , the airport 's managing company , and the first right to build a second sydney airport .
southern cross , which beat off two other bidders for the airport , also includes german construction company hochtief and the commonwealth bank of australia .
the government has already sold the country 's other major airports , in melbourne , brisbane and perth .
but sydney is the nation 's largest , having served about 26 million passengers last year .
big deal the deal was originally launched last summer , but the government delayed completion amid uncertainty after 11 september .
despite the lingering uncertainty in the airline industry , the price achieved was considerably higher than expected , possibly reflecting the booming australian economy .
nicholas moore , head of macquarie 's investment banking group , said passengers would see very little change to the airport , at least in the short term .
southern cross is considering tweaking the airport 's retail area , and plans to widen runways to accommodate more modern aircraft .
the airport sale is one of the last stages in the government 's ongoing privatisation programme , with funds raised earmarked to pay some a $ 4.2bn its a $ 40bn debt .
now , the australian government owns only two significant corporate assets - a 50.1 % stake in dominant telecom firm telstra and all of the country 's largest private medical insurer , medibank private .

"
when the palestinians have new leaders , institutions and security arrangements , the us will support the creation of a palestinian state " george w bush mr bush urged the palestinian people to replace yasser arafat , who has led them for decades , with a leader " not compromised by terror " .
he did not mention mr arafat by name , but correspondents say his message was brutally clear .
most palestinian leaders were outraged by the speech , although support came from an unexpected corner .
mr arafat described the speech as " a serious effort to push the peace process forward " .
israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's spokesman , raanan gissin , welcomed the call for a new palestinian leader .
just hours after the speech , israeli tanks swept into the west bank city of hebron sparking clashes with palestinian gunmen .
israeli offensive palestinian security officials reported that two palestinians had been killed during exchanges of fire in the city .
hebron is the seventh west bank town the israeli army has moved into as part of an offensive it says is aimed at curbing suicide bombings . "
palestinian leaders do n't drop from parachutes from washington or anywhere else .
palestinian leaders are chosen by the palestinian people " saeb erekat , palestinian minister during his speech , mr bush said peace required a " new and different palestinian leadership " which could lead the palestinians to their own state .
" if palestinians embrace democracy , confront corruption , and firmly reject terror , they can count on america 's support for creation of a provisional state of palestine , " he said .
but mr bush said us support for provisional palestinian statehood would only come after the palestinians elected new leaders , built new institutions and new security arrangements to protect israel from terrorist attacks .
opposing views the future borders of the palestinian entity and " certain aspects of its sovereignty " would be provisional until resolved as part of a final settlement in the middle east .
despite mr arafat 's statement supporting mr bush 's speech , other palestinian leaders were far from happy .
palestinian cabinet minister saeb erekat said the call for a new leadership was " not acceptable " , while palestinian cabinet secretary ahmed abdel rahman said that mr bush had " mixed up " the concepts of terrorism and resistance to israeli occupation .
mr erekat insisted that mr arafat was the palestinians ' " directly elected leader in free and fair elections ... and president bush must respect the choice of the palestinian people " .
upsurge in violence " when they chose arafat , they chose a strategy of terror , and they chose to continue sending suicide and homicide bombers to israel , " raanan gissin , a spokesman for the israeli prime minister said .
mr bush 's announcement comes a week after two devastating palestinian suicide attacks on israel , which delayed the speech .
it also comes against the backdrop of major israeli incursions into palestinian-controlled land .
mr bush made it clear that he believed the palestinian leader and his administration to be entirely responsible for the current bloodshed .
officials in washington said that , if mr bush 's conditions were met , a provisional palestinian state could be established in 18 months and then made permanent in about three years as part of a final middle east settlement .
