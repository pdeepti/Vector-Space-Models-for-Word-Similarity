bbc news -pipe- uk politics -pipe- row over threat to tearaways ' benefits high graphics -pipe- bbc sport > > front page -pipe- world -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- business -pipe- sci / tech -pipe- health -pipe- education -pipe- entertainment -pipe- talking point -pipe- audiovideo -pipe- uk politics contents : interviews -pipe- bbc news online : uk politics monday , 29 april , 2002 , 05:44 gmt 06:44 uk row over threat to tearaways ' benefits a proposal by tony blair to stop child benefit for the parents of out-of-control children has been met with an angry broadside .
members of labour 's backbenches , alongside campaigners against child poverty , turned on the government as news of the idea emerged on sunday . "
we are not talking about your child off school for a day with a cold and you lose your child benefit or are financially penalised " estelle morris the liberal democrats and conservatives also lined up to attack it as nothing more than a gimmick ahead of thursday 's local elections .
even deputy prime minister john prescott , speaking on bbc one 's on the record programme , was lukewarm about the proposal .
" we need to tackle the truancy - if that is a possibility of how you might deal with it , i would be prepared to consider it as a possibility , " he said .
the prime minister is understood to have asked government officials to examine the idea as part of a range of measures to ensure parents take greater responsibility for their children .
the plan was discussed as part of a crime summit at downing street earlier this week .
blair 's shock the aim would be to see whether a financial penalty - like the withdrawal of benefit - could strengthen orders already made by the courts in an attempt to force parents to be stricter with offspring who play truant or commit crimes .
mr blair is said to have been shocked to discover that 80 % of school children stopped by police in daytime truancy sweeps were accompanied by an adult .
but labour mp diane abbott has called his proposal " nothing more than a gimmick which will look good on the front pages " .
her backbench colleague alice mahon said the " daft " idea - which she blamed on an " overpaid adviser " - would face huge opposition within labour .
tory leader iain duncan smith , appearing on bbc one 's breakfast with frost , said : " it 's just an announcement to get the press off their backs for five or six days -lsb- in the run up -rsb- to the local elections . "
the plan received a rough ride in the press on monday , with the times saying it was uneccesarily cruel and had " blown up in the government 's face " .
the independent predicted a backbench rebellion if labour pressed ahead with it .
chancellor gordon brown and work and pensions secretary alistair darling are also reported to be opposed to the idea .
truancy figures and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy predicted the proposal will " die a death " .
as the critics lined up on sunday , education secretary estelle morris moved to defend the idea , saying parents had responsibilities .
" we are not talking about your child off school for a day with a cold and you lose your child benefit or are financially penalised , " she told bbc news .
" we are talking about when parents have been warned again and again . "
" taking away child benefit is going to penalise children for which it is intended for the circumstances in which they live " mike aaronson save the children many families , especially those on low incomes , depend on child benefit - £ 15.75 a week for the first child , and £ 10.55 for each additional child .
it rises to £ 17.55 a week for a lone parent with one child .
the child poverty action group -lrb- cpag -rrb- said it was " short-sighted " of the government to float the possibility it could be cut .
" parents do have a responsibility for their children but forcing low-income families deeper into poverty is not going to make the job of parenting any easier , " said cpag director martin barnes .
a spokesman for the national association for the care and resettlement of offenders warned the idea , if implemented , was more likely to increase youth offending than anything else .
and the charity save the children , which launches a campaign against child poverty on monday , described the suggestion on child benefit as a " blunt instrument " .
director general mike aaronson told bbc news : " taking away child benefit is going to penalise children for which it is intended for the circumstances in which they live . "
the low pay unit dismissed the idea as " gesture politics " and said it would be counterproductive in the long run .
