last week , fiat announced last week it would lay off some 8,100 jobs , around 20 per cent of its italian workforce , to cut capacities in an ongoing sales slump , and as part of plans to make fiat auto more attractive to a possible bidder .
italy 's biggest employer fiat workers staged nationwide strikes through last week , and are planning to continue with demonstrations on friday .
amid protests , prime minister silvio berlusconi met fiat executives on sunday to discuss possible state aid .
after hours of talks , berlusconi said in a statement the government was considering possibilities for " a strategic strengthening of the sector " , and that all the measures were " market solutions " , an apparent reference to concerns that italy could break european union rules if it resorted to the kind of direct protection otherwise given by previous italian governments .
" the industrial and financial plan " - due before the end of october – would allow for a " new path " to boost innovation and " improve " on existing fiat support plan , the statement said , adding it would " safeguard the manufacturing centres " .
under the plan , the government is considering extending an incentive plan to trade in old cars , but will also add more weight to direct help to workers and the company .
media reports over the weekend said the government might opt to inject the fiat group with cash or that fiat , which sold 20 per cent of fiat auto to general motors corp. in 2000 would otherwise have to sell the rest to the world 's biggest carmaker by 2004 .
best known symbol once europe 's biggest carmaker , fiat has been forced to cut jobs and output as sales of its once successful branch fiat auto slumped in italy .
the crisis is more than a matter of economic failure , as fiat still remains to be italy 's best know symbol worldwide .
despite its steady decline in sales and increasing losses , fiat still remains italy 's biggest private sector employer .
without state aid , thousands will lose their jobs across the country .
worst hit will be southern italy where two of fiat 's italian car plants , including sicily , one of europe 's poorest regions , face closure .
here , unemployment levels are up to 27 per cent , compared to a 9 per cent national average .
the archbishop of palermo in sicily has already warned that the closure of the termini plant and the resulting loss in 2,000 jobs could lead to a serious rise in unemployment , providing " fertile ground " for the mafia and more crime in the area . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.10.2002 chancellor schröder announces germany ’ s new cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy times : gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and his deputy , joschka fischer after two weeks of negotiations , germany ’ s social democrats and greens have inked an agreement that maps what 's sure to be a rocky path for the next four years . " we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .

" we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .

the american chamber of commerce says the coalition will harm germany ’ s global economic position . german finance minister hans eichel sought to reassure his countrymen and women on tuesday that the austerity deal worked out between the social democrats and the greens will provide a solid basis for future growth .
however , the core component of the plan , the decision to increase taxes , has not been well received by the german and international business community , which fears the new changes will discourage investment .
one of the main points of criticism is the introduction of a minimum tax for large corporations , which would require a company to pay taxes on at least half of its profits .
only the second half could be offset by losses from previous years .
but industry lobbyists say companies recording losses should not have to pay taxes , because it reduces their profit margin and room for investment .
in the long-run , such a tax would hinder corporations ’ growth .
dieter hundt , president of the german employer ’ s association , told the “ financial times deutschland ” that the “ increase in taxes would hinder overall economic growth . ”
ludwig georg braun , president of the german association of industry , trade and commerce , told dw-tv that the current situation is one of “ unease , if not outright fear in the business sector , because there was no hint that this was going to take place . ”
criticism from international community the american chamber of commerce in germany has also criticized the coalition ’ s tax plans , saying they would discourage foreign investment and hamper overall economic growth .
“ the tax increases present a barrier to investment , which will have negative consequences for the entire economy , ” rainer mück , chair of the chamber ’ s tax committee , told the “ financial times deutschland . ”
especially harmful for long-term growth are the plans for limiting the amount of losses a company can deduct from annual profits prior to taxation .
“ here , profits will be taxed before they ’ ve even been made , ” mück said , referring to the new minimum tax requirement .
as a result foreign investors , who operate on a slim profit margin , will look to other locations outside of germany for setting up businesses .
hardly any other eu member state has a minimum tax on corporations , making it extremely difficult for germany to remain competitive .
“ in the context of the current unemployment situation , the question must be raised , whether germany can afford to institute such measures ” that ultimately send foreign employers else where , mück said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.10.2002 dutch coalition government resigns after three months großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little to smile about : prime minister jan-peter balkenende after just three months in office , the dutch coalition government collapsed on wednesday amid tales of in-fighting between members of murdered populist politician pim fortuyn 's lpf party . internal feuding has been blamed for the collapse of the dutch parliament 's coalition government after just three months in office .
prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .
the lpf never puts its chaos aside .

prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .
the lpf never puts its chaos aside .

telepay is designed so that the customer simply sends a text message -lrb- sms -rrb- to a particular telephone number , depending on the sort of ticket he or she wants to buy .
he or she will then receive an answering text message in return which is actually the ticket purchased .
if the customer has to show the ticket to a bus driver , they just display the text message of the mobile phone ’ s screen , which is recognized as proof of the ticket purchase .
at the end of the month , the cost of the ticket appears on the customer ’ s mobile phone bill .
the pilot project , which runs until the end of the month , is intended to test the system ’ s technical functions – for example , the time it takes to get a ticket , or whether it is correctly billed .
but it will be also assessing human factors such as whether train guards and bus drivers can deal with the new type of ticket – let alone the customers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s best-known living writer celebrates his 75th birthday on october 16 and shows no sign of slowing down . this week has seen a wave of tributes to the german writer and artist günter grass , who celebrates his 75th birthday on wednesday .
a towering literary figure in germany for the last four decades , grass has also used his prominence as a platform for incisive political commentary – most recently speaking out in favor of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition and against military action in iraq .
a danzig childhood the son of a grocer , grass grew up in danzig , in present day poland .
he joined the hitler youth in the 1930s and served in the german army during world war ii .
afterwards , he studied painting and sculpture and wrote verse and plays before publishing his hugely successful first novel , the tin drum in1959 .
a 1979 film version of the novel by german director volker schlöndorff was an international success and brought grass acclaim abroad .

his latest novel , im krebsgang , -lrb- “ crabwalk , ” 2002 – english translation due in april 2003 -rrb- , broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii .
by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship “ wilhelm gustloff ” in the baltic , grass is able to trace the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .

last week , fiat announced last week it would lay off some 8,100 jobs , around 20 per cent of its italian workforce , to cut capacities in an ongoing sales slump , and as part of plans to make fiat auto more attractive to a possible bidder .
italy 's biggest employer fiat workers staged nationwide strikes through last week , and are planning to continue with demonstrations on friday .
amid protests , prime minister silvio berlusconi met fiat executives on sunday to discuss possible state aid .
after hours of talks , berlusconi said in a statement the government was considering possibilities for " a strategic strengthening of the sector " , and that all the measures were " market solutions " , an apparent reference to concerns that italy could break european union rules if it resorted to the kind of direct protection otherwise given by previous italian governments .
" the industrial and financial plan " - due before the end of october – would allow for a " new path " to boost innovation and " improve " on existing fiat support plan , the statement said , adding it would " safeguard the manufacturing centres " .
under the plan , the government is considering extending an incentive plan to trade in old cars , but will also add more weight to direct help to workers and the company .
media reports over the weekend said the government might opt to inject the fiat group with cash or that fiat , which sold 20 per cent of fiat auto to general motors corp. in 2000 would otherwise have to sell the rest to the world 's biggest carmaker by 2004 .
best known symbol once europe 's biggest carmaker , fiat has been forced to cut jobs and output as sales of its once successful branch fiat auto slumped in italy .
the crisis is more than a matter of economic failure , as fiat still remains to be italy 's best know symbol worldwide .
despite its steady decline in sales and increasing losses , fiat still remains italy 's biggest private sector employer .
without state aid , thousands will lose their jobs across the country .
worst hit will be southern italy where two of fiat 's italian car plants , including sicily , one of europe 's poorest regions , face closure .
here , unemployment levels are up to 27 per cent , compared to a 9 per cent national average .
the archbishop of palermo in sicily has already warned that the closure of the termini plant and the resulting loss in 2,000 jobs could lead to a serious rise in unemployment , providing " fertile ground " for the mafia and more crime in the area . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

last week , fiat announced last week it would lay off some 8,100 jobs , around 20 per cent of its italian workforce , to cut capacities in an ongoing sales slump , and as part of plans to make fiat auto more attractive to a possible bidder .
italy 's biggest employer fiat workers staged nationwide strikes through last week , and are planning to continue with demonstrations on friday .
amid protests , prime minister silvio berlusconi met fiat executives on sunday to discuss possible state aid .
after hours of talks , berlusconi said in a statement the government was considering possibilities for " a strategic strengthening of the sector " , and that all the measures were " market solutions " , an apparent reference to concerns that italy could break european union rules if it resorted to the kind of direct protection otherwise given by previous italian governments .
" the industrial and financial plan " - due before the end of october – would allow for a " new path " to boost innovation and " improve " on existing fiat support plan , the statement said , adding it would " safeguard the manufacturing centres " .
under the plan , the government is considering extending an incentive plan to trade in old cars , but will also add more weight to direct help to workers and the company .
media reports over the weekend said the government might opt to inject the fiat group with cash or that fiat , which sold 20 per cent of fiat auto to general motors corp. in 2000 would otherwise have to sell the rest to the world 's biggest carmaker by 2004 .

prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .
the lpf never puts its chaos aside .

germany ’ s best-known living writer celebrates his 75th birthday on october 16 and shows no sign of slowing down . this week has seen a wave of tributes to the german writer and artist günter grass , who celebrates his 75th birthday on wednesday .
a towering literary figure in germany for the last four decades , grass has also used his prominence as a platform for incisive political commentary – most recently speaking out in favor of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition and against military action in iraq .
a danzig childhood the son of a grocer , grass grew up in danzig , in present day poland .
he joined the hitler youth in the 1930s and served in the german army during world war ii .
afterwards , he studied painting and sculpture and wrote verse and plays before publishing his hugely successful first novel , the tin drum in1959 .
a 1979 film version of the novel by german director volker schlöndorff was an international success and brought grass acclaim abroad .
like the two other works in the so-called “ danzig trilogy ” - katz und maus -lrb- “ cat and mouse , ” 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- “ dog years , ” 1963 -rrb- - the tin drum draws on the author ’ s early life in the german-polish port city .
“ books don ’ t just happen , ” grass told the german weekly die woche .
“ they are lived out in advance – and they take much longer to live out than they do to get written down . "
the conscience of the german federal republic history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ’ works .
he frequently refers to himself as a “ public moralist , ” and the german president , johannes rau , has called him “ the conscience of the res publica . ”
ein weites feld -lrb- “ too far afield , ” 1995 -rrb- was the first literary work by a prominent author to deal with german reunification , which grass opposed , referring to it as an “ annexation . ”
his latest novel , im krebsgang , -lrb- “ crabwalk , ” 2002 – english translation due in april 2003 -rrb- , broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii .
by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship “ wilhelm gustloff ” in the baltic , grass is able to trace the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like grass ’ earlier works , it underlines the author ’ s preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived .
the man the chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ one of the greatest writers of our time and a great patriot ” has been the recipient of numerous prestigious awards and honors , including the nobel prize for literature in 1999 .
this and his uncompromising political stance often detract from his success as a sculptor , graphic artist and painter .

his latest novel , im krebsgang , -lrb- “ crabwalk , ” 2002 – english translation due in april 2003 -rrb- , broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii .
by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship “ wilhelm gustloff ” in the baltic , grass is able to trace the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like grass ’ earlier works , it underlines the author ’ s preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived .
the man the chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ one of the greatest writers of our time and a great patriot ” has been the recipient of numerous prestigious awards and honors , including the nobel prize for literature in 1999 .
this and his uncompromising political stance often detract from his success as a sculptor , graphic artist and painter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.10.2002 chancellor schröder announces germany ’ s new cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy times : gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and his deputy , joschka fischer after two weeks of negotiations , germany ’ s social democrats and greens have inked an agreement that maps what 's sure to be a rocky path for the next four years . " we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .
the new cabinet will be sworn into office on thursday in the bundestag . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

in berlin , the waiting may soon be outdated as the city tests a cell phone system which allows people to just dial up and go . berlin ’ s public transport authority , the bvg , has joined up with telecommunications provider e-plus to field test a system which allows passengers the chance to buy and receive tickets through their mobile phones .
the offer currently only applies to full-price single tickets , which are valid for two hours , and to single-day tickets , and is limited to the two innermost transportation zones .
the electronic function is also only available to customers who have a full contract with e-plus .
“ free-and-easy ” contracts , where the telephone is topped up by buying a new card , are not eligible .
the bvg says that the pilot project will be extended to other mobile phone providers if it proves a success .
telepay project covers a number of countries the berlin field test is part of a wider european union project called telepay , which so far also involves various transport and telecom providers in france , italy and finland , as well as the electronics manufacturers ertico and siemens .
berlin is the first city in germany to take part in the project .
telepay is designed so that the customer simply sends a text message -lrb- sms -rrb- to a particular telephone number , depending on the sort of ticket he or she wants to buy .
he or she will then receive an answering text message in return which is actually the ticket purchased .
if the customer has to show the ticket to a bus driver , they just display the text message of the mobile phone ’ s screen , which is recognized as proof of the ticket purchase .
at the end of the month , the cost of the ticket appears on the customer ’ s mobile phone bill .
the pilot project , which runs until the end of the month , is intended to test the system ’ s technical functions – for example , the time it takes to get a ticket , or whether it is correctly billed .
but it will be also assessing human factors such as whether train guards and bus drivers can deal with the new type of ticket – let alone the customers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .

the american chamber of commerce says the coalition will harm germany ’ s global economic position . german finance minister hans eichel sought to reassure his countrymen and women on tuesday that the austerity deal worked out between the social democrats and the greens will provide a solid basis for future growth .
however , the core component of the plan , the decision to increase taxes , has not been well received by the german and international business community , which fears the new changes will discourage investment .
one of the main points of criticism is the introduction of a minimum tax for large corporations , which would require a company to pay taxes on at least half of its profits .
only the second half could be offset by losses from previous years .
but industry lobbyists say companies recording losses should not have to pay taxes , because it reduces their profit margin and room for investment .
in the long-run , such a tax would hinder corporations ’ growth .
dieter hundt , president of the german employer ’ s association , told the “ financial times deutschland ” that the “ increase in taxes would hinder overall economic growth . ”
ludwig georg braun , president of the german association of industry , trade and commerce , told dw-tv that the current situation is one of “ unease , if not outright fear in the business sector , because there was no hint that this was going to take place . ”
criticism from international community the american chamber of commerce in germany has also criticized the coalition ’ s tax plans , saying they would discourage foreign investment and hamper overall economic growth .
“ the tax increases present a barrier to investment , which will have negative consequences for the entire economy , ” rainer mück , chair of the chamber ’ s tax committee , told the “ financial times deutschland . ”
especially harmful for long-term growth are the plans for limiting the amount of losses a company can deduct from annual profits prior to taxation .
“ here , profits will be taxed before they ’ ve even been made , ” mück said , referring to the new minimum tax requirement .
as a result foreign investors , who operate on a slim profit margin , will look to other locations outside of germany for setting up businesses .
hardly any other eu member state has a minimum tax on corporations , making it extremely difficult for germany to remain competitive .
“ in the context of the current unemployment situation , the question must be raised , whether germany can afford to institute such measures ” that ultimately send foreign employers else where , mück said .
currently , the american chamber of commerce in germany lists more than 3,000 members and is the largest bilateral business association in europe .
according to its statistics , the chamber represents the largest group of foreign investors in germany , investors who may be turned off by the new tax regulations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but industry lobbyists say companies recording losses should not have to pay taxes , because it reduces their profit margin and room for investment .
in the long-run , such a tax would hinder corporations ’ growth .
dieter hundt , president of the german employer ’ s association , told the “ financial times deutschland ” that the “ increase in taxes would hinder overall economic growth . ”
ludwig georg braun , president of the german association of industry , trade and commerce , told dw-tv that the current situation is one of “ unease , if not outright fear in the business sector , because there was no hint that this was going to take place . ”
criticism from international community the american chamber of commerce in germany has also criticized the coalition ’ s tax plans , saying they would discourage foreign investment and hamper overall economic growth .
“ the tax increases present a barrier to investment , which will have negative consequences for the entire economy , ” rainer mück , chair of the chamber ’ s tax committee , told the “ financial times deutschland . ”
especially harmful for long-term growth are the plans for limiting the amount of losses a company can deduct from annual profits prior to taxation .
“ here , profits will be taxed before they ’ ve even been made , ” mück said , referring to the new minimum tax requirement .
as a result foreign investors , who operate on a slim profit margin , will look to other locations outside of germany for setting up businesses .
hardly any other eu member state has a minimum tax on corporations , making it extremely difficult for germany to remain competitive .
“ in the context of the current unemployment situation , the question must be raised , whether germany can afford to institute such measures ” that ultimately send foreign employers else where , mück said .
currently , the american chamber of commerce in germany lists more than 3,000 members and is the largest bilateral business association in europe .

prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .

the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .
the lpf never puts its chaos aside .

prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .

heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .

last week , fiat announced last week it would lay off some 8,100 jobs , around 20 per cent of its italian workforce , to cut capacities in an ongoing sales slump , and as part of plans to make fiat auto more attractive to a possible bidder .
italy 's biggest employer fiat workers staged nationwide strikes through last week , and are planning to continue with demonstrations on friday .
amid protests , prime minister silvio berlusconi met fiat executives on sunday to discuss possible state aid .
after hours of talks , berlusconi said in a statement the government was considering possibilities for " a strategic strengthening of the sector " , and that all the measures were " market solutions " , an apparent reference to concerns that italy could break european union rules if it resorted to the kind of direct protection otherwise given by previous italian governments .
" the industrial and financial plan " - due before the end of october – would allow for a " new path " to boost innovation and " improve " on existing fiat support plan , the statement said , adding it would " safeguard the manufacturing centres " .
under the plan , the government is considering extending an incentive plan to trade in old cars , but will also add more weight to direct help to workers and the company .
media reports over the weekend said the government might opt to inject the fiat group with cash or that fiat , which sold 20 per cent of fiat auto to general motors corp. in 2000 would otherwise have to sell the rest to the world 's biggest carmaker by 2004 .
best known symbol once europe 's biggest carmaker , fiat has been forced to cut jobs and output as sales of its once successful branch fiat auto slumped in italy .
the crisis is more than a matter of economic failure , as fiat still remains to be italy 's best know symbol worldwide .
despite its steady decline in sales and increasing losses , fiat still remains italy 's biggest private sector employer .
without state aid , thousands will lose their jobs across the country .
worst hit will be southern italy where two of fiat 's italian car plants , including sicily , one of europe 's poorest regions , face closure .
here , unemployment levels are up to 27 per cent , compared to a 9 per cent national average .
the archbishop of palermo in sicily has already warned that the closure of the termini plant and the resulting loss in 2,000 jobs could lead to a serious rise in unemployment , providing " fertile ground " for the mafia and more crime in the area . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s best-known living writer celebrates his 75th birthday on october 16 and shows no sign of slowing down . this week has seen a wave of tributes to the german writer and artist günter grass , who celebrates his 75th birthday on wednesday .
a towering literary figure in germany for the last four decades , grass has also used his prominence as a platform for incisive political commentary – most recently speaking out in favor of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition and against military action in iraq .
a danzig childhood the son of a grocer , grass grew up in danzig , in present day poland .
he joined the hitler youth in the 1930s and served in the german army during world war ii .
afterwards , he studied painting and sculpture and wrote verse and plays before publishing his hugely successful first novel , the tin drum in1959 .
a 1979 film version of the novel by german director volker schlöndorff was an international success and brought grass acclaim abroad .
like the two other works in the so-called “ danzig trilogy ” - katz und maus -lrb- “ cat and mouse , ” 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- “ dog years , ” 1963 -rrb- - the tin drum draws on the author ’ s early life in the german-polish port city .
“ books don ’ t just happen , ” grass told the german weekly die woche .
“ they are lived out in advance – and they take much longer to live out than they do to get written down . "
the conscience of the german federal republic history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ’ works .
he frequently refers to himself as a “ public moralist , ” and the german president , johannes rau , has called him “ the conscience of the res publica . ”
ein weites feld -lrb- “ too far afield , ” 1995 -rrb- was the first literary work by a prominent author to deal with german reunification , which grass opposed , referring to it as an “ annexation . ”
his latest novel , im krebsgang , -lrb- “ crabwalk , ” 2002 – english translation due in april 2003 -rrb- , broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii .
by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship “ wilhelm gustloff ” in the baltic , grass is able to trace the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like grass ’ earlier works , it underlines the author ’ s preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived .
the man the chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ one of the greatest writers of our time and a great patriot ” has been the recipient of numerous prestigious awards and honors , including the nobel prize for literature in 1999 .
this and his uncompromising political stance often detract from his success as a sculptor , graphic artist and painter .
a series of exhibitions covering the author ’ s activities opens at the " günter-grass-haus , " a museum dedicated to the writer ’ s life and work , in lübeck on october 20 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

" we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .

through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .

stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .

the american chamber of commerce says the coalition will harm germany ’ s global economic position . german finance minister hans eichel sought to reassure his countrymen and women on tuesday that the austerity deal worked out between the social democrats and the greens will provide a solid basis for future growth .
however , the core component of the plan , the decision to increase taxes , has not been well received by the german and international business community , which fears the new changes will discourage investment .
one of the main points of criticism is the introduction of a minimum tax for large corporations , which would require a company to pay taxes on at least half of its profits .
only the second half could be offset by losses from previous years .
but industry lobbyists say companies recording losses should not have to pay taxes , because it reduces their profit margin and room for investment .
in the long-run , such a tax would hinder corporations ’ growth .
dieter hundt , president of the german employer ’ s association , told the “ financial times deutschland ” that the “ increase in taxes would hinder overall economic growth . ”
ludwig georg braun , president of the german association of industry , trade and commerce , told dw-tv that the current situation is one of “ unease , if not outright fear in the business sector , because there was no hint that this was going to take place . ”
criticism from international community the american chamber of commerce in germany has also criticized the coalition ’ s tax plans , saying they would discourage foreign investment and hamper overall economic growth .
“ the tax increases present a barrier to investment , which will have negative consequences for the entire economy , ” rainer mück , chair of the chamber ’ s tax committee , told the “ financial times deutschland . ”
especially harmful for long-term growth are the plans for limiting the amount of losses a company can deduct from annual profits prior to taxation .
“ here , profits will be taxed before they ’ ve even been made , ” mück said , referring to the new minimum tax requirement .
as a result foreign investors , who operate on a slim profit margin , will look to other locations outside of germany for setting up businesses .
hardly any other eu member state has a minimum tax on corporations , making it extremely difficult for germany to remain competitive .
“ in the context of the current unemployment situation , the question must be raised , whether germany can afford to institute such measures ” that ultimately send foreign employers else where , mück said .
currently , the american chamber of commerce in germany lists more than 3,000 members and is the largest bilateral business association in europe .
according to its statistics , the chamber represents the largest group of foreign investors in germany , investors who may be turned off by the new tax regulations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.10.2002 dutch coalition government resigns after three months großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little to smile about : prime minister jan-peter balkenende after just three months in office , the dutch coalition government collapsed on wednesday amid tales of in-fighting between members of murdered populist politician pim fortuyn 's lpf party . internal feuding has been blamed for the collapse of the dutch parliament 's coalition government after just three months in office .
prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .
the lpf never puts its chaos aside .

germany ’ s best-known living writer celebrates his 75th birthday on october 16 and shows no sign of slowing down . this week has seen a wave of tributes to the german writer and artist günter grass , who celebrates his 75th birthday on wednesday .
a towering literary figure in germany for the last four decades , grass has also used his prominence as a platform for incisive political commentary – most recently speaking out in favor of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition and against military action in iraq .
a danzig childhood the son of a grocer , grass grew up in danzig , in present day poland .
he joined the hitler youth in the 1930s and served in the german army during world war ii .
afterwards , he studied painting and sculpture and wrote verse and plays before publishing his hugely successful first novel , the tin drum in1959 .
a 1979 film version of the novel by german director volker schlöndorff was an international success and brought grass acclaim abroad .
like the two other works in the so-called “ danzig trilogy ” - katz und maus -lrb- “ cat and mouse , ” 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- “ dog years , ” 1963 -rrb- - the tin drum draws on the author ’ s early life in the german-polish port city .
“ books don ’ t just happen , ” grass told the german weekly die woche .
“ they are lived out in advance – and they take much longer to live out than they do to get written down . "
the conscience of the german federal republic history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ’ works .
he frequently refers to himself as a “ public moralist , ” and the german president , johannes rau , has called him “ the conscience of the res publica . ”
ein weites feld -lrb- “ too far afield , ” 1995 -rrb- was the first literary work by a prominent author to deal with german reunification , which grass opposed , referring to it as an “ annexation . ”
his latest novel , im krebsgang , -lrb- “ crabwalk , ” 2002 – english translation due in april 2003 -rrb- , broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii .
by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship “ wilhelm gustloff ” in the baltic , grass is able to trace the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like grass ’ earlier works , it underlines the author ’ s preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived .

germany ’ s best-known living writer celebrates his 75th birthday on october 16 and shows no sign of slowing down . this week has seen a wave of tributes to the german writer and artist günter grass , who celebrates his 75th birthday on wednesday .
a towering literary figure in germany for the last four decades , grass has also used his prominence as a platform for incisive political commentary – most recently speaking out in favor of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition and against military action in iraq .
a danzig childhood the son of a grocer , grass grew up in danzig , in present day poland .
he joined the hitler youth in the 1930s and served in the german army during world war ii .
afterwards , he studied painting and sculpture and wrote verse and plays before publishing his hugely successful first novel , the tin drum in1959 .
a 1979 film version of the novel by german director volker schlöndorff was an international success and brought grass acclaim abroad .
like the two other works in the so-called “ danzig trilogy ” - katz und maus -lrb- “ cat and mouse , ” 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- “ dog years , ” 1963 -rrb- - the tin drum draws on the author ’ s early life in the german-polish port city .
“ books don ’ t just happen , ” grass told the german weekly die woche .
“ they are lived out in advance – and they take much longer to live out than they do to get written down . "
the conscience of the german federal republic history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ’ works .
he frequently refers to himself as a “ public moralist , ” and the german president , johannes rau , has called him “ the conscience of the res publica . ”
ein weites feld -lrb- “ too far afield , ” 1995 -rrb- was the first literary work by a prominent author to deal with german reunification , which grass opposed , referring to it as an “ annexation . ”
his latest novel , im krebsgang , -lrb- “ crabwalk , ” 2002 – english translation due in april 2003 -rrb- , broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii .
by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship “ wilhelm gustloff ” in the baltic , grass is able to trace the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like grass ’ earlier works , it underlines the author ’ s preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived .
the man the chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ one of the greatest writers of our time and a great patriot ” has been the recipient of numerous prestigious awards and honors , including the nobel prize for literature in 1999 .

last week , fiat announced last week it would lay off some 8,100 jobs , around 20 per cent of its italian workforce , to cut capacities in an ongoing sales slump , and as part of plans to make fiat auto more attractive to a possible bidder .
italy 's biggest employer fiat workers staged nationwide strikes through last week , and are planning to continue with demonstrations on friday .
amid protests , prime minister silvio berlusconi met fiat executives on sunday to discuss possible state aid .
after hours of talks , berlusconi said in a statement the government was considering possibilities for " a strategic strengthening of the sector " , and that all the measures were " market solutions " , an apparent reference to concerns that italy could break european union rules if it resorted to the kind of direct protection otherwise given by previous italian governments .
" the industrial and financial plan " - due before the end of october – would allow for a " new path " to boost innovation and " improve " on existing fiat support plan , the statement said , adding it would " safeguard the manufacturing centres " .
under the plan , the government is considering extending an incentive plan to trade in old cars , but will also add more weight to direct help to workers and the company .
media reports over the weekend said the government might opt to inject the fiat group with cash or that fiat , which sold 20 per cent of fiat auto to general motors corp. in 2000 would otherwise have to sell the rest to the world 's biggest carmaker by 2004 .
best known symbol once europe 's biggest carmaker , fiat has been forced to cut jobs and output as sales of its once successful branch fiat auto slumped in italy .
the crisis is more than a matter of economic failure , as fiat still remains to be italy 's best know symbol worldwide .
despite its steady decline in sales and increasing losses , fiat still remains italy 's biggest private sector employer .
without state aid , thousands will lose their jobs across the country .
worst hit will be southern italy where two of fiat 's italian car plants , including sicily , one of europe 's poorest regions , face closure .
here , unemployment levels are up to 27 per cent , compared to a 9 per cent national average .

the american chamber of commerce says the coalition will harm germany ’ s global economic position . german finance minister hans eichel sought to reassure his countrymen and women on tuesday that the austerity deal worked out between the social democrats and the greens will provide a solid basis for future growth .
however , the core component of the plan , the decision to increase taxes , has not been well received by the german and international business community , which fears the new changes will discourage investment .
one of the main points of criticism is the introduction of a minimum tax for large corporations , which would require a company to pay taxes on at least half of its profits .
only the second half could be offset by losses from previous years .
but industry lobbyists say companies recording losses should not have to pay taxes , because it reduces their profit margin and room for investment .
in the long-run , such a tax would hinder corporations ’ growth .
dieter hundt , president of the german employer ’ s association , told the “ financial times deutschland ” that the “ increase in taxes would hinder overall economic growth . ”
ludwig georg braun , president of the german association of industry , trade and commerce , told dw-tv that the current situation is one of “ unease , if not outright fear in the business sector , because there was no hint that this was going to take place . ”
criticism from international community the american chamber of commerce in germany has also criticized the coalition ’ s tax plans , saying they would discourage foreign investment and hamper overall economic growth .
“ the tax increases present a barrier to investment , which will have negative consequences for the entire economy , ” rainer mück , chair of the chamber ’ s tax committee , told the “ financial times deutschland . ”
especially harmful for long-term growth are the plans for limiting the amount of losses a company can deduct from annual profits prior to taxation .
“ here , profits will be taxed before they ’ ve even been made , ” mück said , referring to the new minimum tax requirement .
as a result foreign investors , who operate on a slim profit margin , will look to other locations outside of germany for setting up businesses .
hardly any other eu member state has a minimum tax on corporations , making it extremely difficult for germany to remain competitive .
“ in the context of the current unemployment situation , the question must be raised , whether germany can afford to institute such measures ” that ultimately send foreign employers else where , mück said .
currently , the american chamber of commerce in germany lists more than 3,000 members and is the largest bilateral business association in europe .
according to its statistics , the chamber represents the largest group of foreign investors in germany , investors who may be turned off by the new tax regulations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.10.2002 chancellor schröder announces germany ’ s new cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy times : gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and his deputy , joschka fischer after two weeks of negotiations , germany ’ s social democrats and greens have inked an agreement that maps what 's sure to be a rocky path for the next four years . " we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.10.2002 italian government under fire over fiat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many may be out of a job sooner rather than later italy 's government is under fire to save the country 's best known industrial symbol , fiat , which is in danger of being sold to the world 's biggest automaker , general motor corp. italy 's centre-right government is under increasing pressure amid a growing crisis at carmaker fiat which may cost thousands of jobs in some of italy 's poorest regions .
last week , fiat announced last week it would lay off some 8,100 jobs , around 20 per cent of its italian workforce , to cut capacities in an ongoing sales slump , and as part of plans to make fiat auto more attractive to a possible bidder .
italy 's biggest employer fiat workers staged nationwide strikes through last week , and are planning to continue with demonstrations on friday .
amid protests , prime minister silvio berlusconi met fiat executives on sunday to discuss possible state aid .
after hours of talks , berlusconi said in a statement the government was considering possibilities for " a strategic strengthening of the sector " , and that all the measures were " market solutions " , an apparent reference to concerns that italy could break european union rules if it resorted to the kind of direct protection otherwise given by previous italian governments .
" the industrial and financial plan " - due before the end of october – would allow for a " new path " to boost innovation and " improve " on existing fiat support plan , the statement said , adding it would " safeguard the manufacturing centres " .
under the plan , the government is considering extending an incentive plan to trade in old cars , but will also add more weight to direct help to workers and the company .
media reports over the weekend said the government might opt to inject the fiat group with cash or that fiat , which sold 20 per cent of fiat auto to general motors corp. in 2000 would otherwise have to sell the rest to the world 's biggest carmaker by 2004 .
best known symbol once europe 's biggest carmaker , fiat has been forced to cut jobs and output as sales of its once successful branch fiat auto slumped in italy .
the crisis is more than a matter of economic failure , as fiat still remains to be italy 's best know symbol worldwide .
despite its steady decline in sales and increasing losses , fiat still remains italy 's biggest private sector employer .
without state aid , thousands will lose their jobs across the country .
worst hit will be southern italy where two of fiat 's italian car plants , including sicily , one of europe 's poorest regions , face closure .
here , unemployment levels are up to 27 per cent , compared to a 9 per cent national average .
the archbishop of palermo in sicily has already warned that the closure of the termini plant and the resulting loss in 2,000 jobs could lead to a serious rise in unemployment , providing " fertile ground " for the mafia and more crime in the area . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .
the new cabinet will be sworn into office on thursday in the bundestag . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the american chamber of commerce says the coalition will harm germany ’ s global economic position . german finance minister hans eichel sought to reassure his countrymen and women on tuesday that the austerity deal worked out between the social democrats and the greens will provide a solid basis for future growth .
however , the core component of the plan , the decision to increase taxes , has not been well received by the german and international business community , which fears the new changes will discourage investment .
one of the main points of criticism is the introduction of a minimum tax for large corporations , which would require a company to pay taxes on at least half of its profits .
only the second half could be offset by losses from previous years .
but industry lobbyists say companies recording losses should not have to pay taxes , because it reduces their profit margin and room for investment .
in the long-run , such a tax would hinder corporations ’ growth .
dieter hundt , president of the german employer ’ s association , told the “ financial times deutschland ” that the “ increase in taxes would hinder overall economic growth . ”
ludwig georg braun , president of the german association of industry , trade and commerce , told dw-tv that the current situation is one of “ unease , if not outright fear in the business sector , because there was no hint that this was going to take place . ”
criticism from international community the american chamber of commerce in germany has also criticized the coalition ’ s tax plans , saying they would discourage foreign investment and hamper overall economic growth .
“ the tax increases present a barrier to investment , which will have negative consequences for the entire economy , ” rainer mück , chair of the chamber ’ s tax committee , told the “ financial times deutschland . ”
especially harmful for long-term growth are the plans for limiting the amount of losses a company can deduct from annual profits prior to taxation .
“ here , profits will be taxed before they ’ ve even been made , ” mück said , referring to the new minimum tax requirement .
as a result foreign investors , who operate on a slim profit margin , will look to other locations outside of germany for setting up businesses .
hardly any other eu member state has a minimum tax on corporations , making it extremely difficult for germany to remain competitive .
“ in the context of the current unemployment situation , the question must be raised , whether germany can afford to institute such measures ” that ultimately send foreign employers else where , mück said .
currently , the american chamber of commerce in germany lists more than 3,000 members and is the largest bilateral business association in europe .
according to its statistics , the chamber represents the largest group of foreign investors in germany , investors who may be turned off by the new tax regulations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .
the lpf never puts its chaos aside .

in berlin , the waiting may soon be outdated as the city tests a cell phone system which allows people to just dial up and go . berlin ’ s public transport authority , the bvg , has joined up with telecommunications provider e-plus to field test a system which allows passengers the chance to buy and receive tickets through their mobile phones .
the offer currently only applies to full-price single tickets , which are valid for two hours , and to single-day tickets , and is limited to the two innermost transportation zones .
the electronic function is also only available to customers who have a full contract with e-plus .
“ free-and-easy ” contracts , where the telephone is topped up by buying a new card , are not eligible .
the bvg says that the pilot project will be extended to other mobile phone providers if it proves a success .
telepay project covers a number of countries the berlin field test is part of a wider european union project called telepay , which so far also involves various transport and telecom providers in france , italy and finland , as well as the electronics manufacturers ertico and siemens .
berlin is the first city in germany to take part in the project .
telepay is designed so that the customer simply sends a text message -lrb- sms -rrb- to a particular telephone number , depending on the sort of ticket he or she wants to buy .
he or she will then receive an answering text message in return which is actually the ticket purchased .
if the customer has to show the ticket to a bus driver , they just display the text message of the mobile phone ’ s screen , which is recognized as proof of the ticket purchase .
at the end of the month , the cost of the ticket appears on the customer ’ s mobile phone bill .
the pilot project , which runs until the end of the month , is intended to test the system ’ s technical functions – for example , the time it takes to get a ticket , or whether it is correctly billed .
but it will be also assessing human factors such as whether train guards and bus drivers can deal with the new type of ticket – let alone the customers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the american chamber of commerce says the coalition will harm germany ’ s global economic position . german finance minister hans eichel sought to reassure his countrymen and women on tuesday that the austerity deal worked out between the social democrats and the greens will provide a solid basis for future growth .
however , the core component of the plan , the decision to increase taxes , has not been well received by the german and international business community , which fears the new changes will discourage investment .
one of the main points of criticism is the introduction of a minimum tax for large corporations , which would require a company to pay taxes on at least half of its profits .
only the second half could be offset by losses from previous years .
but industry lobbyists say companies recording losses should not have to pay taxes , because it reduces their profit margin and room for investment .
in the long-run , such a tax would hinder corporations ’ growth .
dieter hundt , president of the german employer ’ s association , told the “ financial times deutschland ” that the “ increase in taxes would hinder overall economic growth . ”
ludwig georg braun , president of the german association of industry , trade and commerce , told dw-tv that the current situation is one of “ unease , if not outright fear in the business sector , because there was no hint that this was going to take place . ”
criticism from international community the american chamber of commerce in germany has also criticized the coalition ’ s tax plans , saying they would discourage foreign investment and hamper overall economic growth .
“ the tax increases present a barrier to investment , which will have negative consequences for the entire economy , ” rainer mück , chair of the chamber ’ s tax committee , told the “ financial times deutschland . ”

prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .

germany ’ s best-known living writer celebrates his 75th birthday on october 16 and shows no sign of slowing down . this week has seen a wave of tributes to the german writer and artist günter grass , who celebrates his 75th birthday on wednesday .
a towering literary figure in germany for the last four decades , grass has also used his prominence as a platform for incisive political commentary – most recently speaking out in favor of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition and against military action in iraq .
a danzig childhood the son of a grocer , grass grew up in danzig , in present day poland .
he joined the hitler youth in the 1930s and served in the german army during world war ii .

prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .
the lpf never puts its chaos aside .

the offer currently only applies to full-price single tickets , which are valid for two hours , and to single-day tickets , and is limited to the two innermost transportation zones .
the electronic function is also only available to customers who have a full contract with e-plus .
“ free-and-easy ” contracts , where the telephone is topped up by buying a new card , are not eligible .
the bvg says that the pilot project will be extended to other mobile phone providers if it proves a success .
telepay project covers a number of countries the berlin field test is part of a wider european union project called telepay , which so far also involves various transport and telecom providers in france , italy and finland , as well as the electronics manufacturers ertico and siemens .
berlin is the first city in germany to take part in the project .
telepay is designed so that the customer simply sends a text message -lrb- sms -rrb- to a particular telephone number , depending on the sort of ticket he or she wants to buy .
he or she will then receive an answering text message in return which is actually the ticket purchased .
if the customer has to show the ticket to a bus driver , they just display the text message of the mobile phone ’ s screen , which is recognized as proof of the ticket purchase .
at the end of the month , the cost of the ticket appears on the customer ’ s mobile phone bill .
the pilot project , which runs until the end of the month , is intended to test the system ’ s technical functions – for example , the time it takes to get a ticket , or whether it is correctly billed .
but it will be also assessing human factors such as whether train guards and bus drivers can deal with the new type of ticket – let alone the customers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s best-known living writer celebrates his 75th birthday on october 16 and shows no sign of slowing down . this week has seen a wave of tributes to the german writer and artist günter grass , who celebrates his 75th birthday on wednesday .
a towering literary figure in germany for the last four decades , grass has also used his prominence as a platform for incisive political commentary – most recently speaking out in favor of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition and against military action in iraq .
a danzig childhood the son of a grocer , grass grew up in danzig , in present day poland .
he joined the hitler youth in the 1930s and served in the german army during world war ii .
afterwards , he studied painting and sculpture and wrote verse and plays before publishing his hugely successful first novel , the tin drum in1959 .
a 1979 film version of the novel by german director volker schlöndorff was an international success and brought grass acclaim abroad .
like the two other works in the so-called “ danzig trilogy ” - katz und maus -lrb- “ cat and mouse , ” 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- “ dog years , ” 1963 -rrb- - the tin drum draws on the author ’ s early life in the german-polish port city .
“ books don ’ t just happen , ” grass told the german weekly die woche .
“ they are lived out in advance – and they take much longer to live out than they do to get written down . "
the conscience of the german federal republic history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ’ works .
he frequently refers to himself as a “ public moralist , ” and the german president , johannes rau , has called him “ the conscience of the res publica . ”
ein weites feld -lrb- “ too far afield , ” 1995 -rrb- was the first literary work by a prominent author to deal with german reunification , which grass opposed , referring to it as an “ annexation . ”
his latest novel , im krebsgang , -lrb- “ crabwalk , ” 2002 – english translation due in april 2003 -rrb- , broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii .
by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship “ wilhelm gustloff ” in the baltic , grass is able to trace the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like grass ’ earlier works , it underlines the author ’ s preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived .
the man the chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ one of the greatest writers of our time and a great patriot ” has been the recipient of numerous prestigious awards and honors , including the nobel prize for literature in 1999 .
this and his uncompromising political stance often detract from his success as a sculptor , graphic artist and painter .

last week , fiat announced last week it would lay off some 8,100 jobs , around 20 per cent of its italian workforce , to cut capacities in an ongoing sales slump , and as part of plans to make fiat auto more attractive to a possible bidder .
italy 's biggest employer fiat workers staged nationwide strikes through last week , and are planning to continue with demonstrations on friday .
amid protests , prime minister silvio berlusconi met fiat executives on sunday to discuss possible state aid .
after hours of talks , berlusconi said in a statement the government was considering possibilities for " a strategic strengthening of the sector " , and that all the measures were " market solutions " , an apparent reference to concerns that italy could break european union rules if it resorted to the kind of direct protection otherwise given by previous italian governments .
" the industrial and financial plan " - due before the end of october – would allow for a " new path " to boost innovation and " improve " on existing fiat support plan , the statement said , adding it would " safeguard the manufacturing centres " .
under the plan , the government is considering extending an incentive plan to trade in old cars , but will also add more weight to direct help to workers and the company .
media reports over the weekend said the government might opt to inject the fiat group with cash or that fiat , which sold 20 per cent of fiat auto to general motors corp. in 2000 would otherwise have to sell the rest to the world 's biggest carmaker by 2004 .
best known symbol once europe 's biggest carmaker , fiat has been forced to cut jobs and output as sales of its once successful branch fiat auto slumped in italy .
the crisis is more than a matter of economic failure , as fiat still remains to be italy 's best know symbol worldwide .
despite its steady decline in sales and increasing losses , fiat still remains italy 's biggest private sector employer .
without state aid , thousands will lose their jobs across the country .
worst hit will be southern italy where two of fiat 's italian car plants , including sicily , one of europe 's poorest regions , face closure .
here , unemployment levels are up to 27 per cent , compared to a 9 per cent national average .

last week , fiat announced last week it would lay off some 8,100 jobs , around 20 per cent of its italian workforce , to cut capacities in an ongoing sales slump , and as part of plans to make fiat auto more attractive to a possible bidder .
italy 's biggest employer fiat workers staged nationwide strikes through last week , and are planning to continue with demonstrations on friday .
amid protests , prime minister silvio berlusconi met fiat executives on sunday to discuss possible state aid .
after hours of talks , berlusconi said in a statement the government was considering possibilities for " a strategic strengthening of the sector " , and that all the measures were " market solutions " , an apparent reference to concerns that italy could break european union rules if it resorted to the kind of direct protection otherwise given by previous italian governments .
" the industrial and financial plan " - due before the end of october – would allow for a " new path " to boost innovation and " improve " on existing fiat support plan , the statement said , adding it would " safeguard the manufacturing centres " .
under the plan , the government is considering extending an incentive plan to trade in old cars , but will also add more weight to direct help to workers and the company .
media reports over the weekend said the government might opt to inject the fiat group with cash or that fiat , which sold 20 per cent of fiat auto to general motors corp. in 2000 would otherwise have to sell the rest to the world 's biggest carmaker by 2004 .
best known symbol once europe 's biggest carmaker , fiat has been forced to cut jobs and output as sales of its once successful branch fiat auto slumped in italy .
the crisis is more than a matter of economic failure , as fiat still remains to be italy 's best know symbol worldwide .
despite its steady decline in sales and increasing losses , fiat still remains italy 's biggest private sector employer .
without state aid , thousands will lose their jobs across the country .
worst hit will be southern italy where two of fiat 's italian car plants , including sicily , one of europe 's poorest regions , face closure .
here , unemployment levels are up to 27 per cent , compared to a 9 per cent national average .

" we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .

" we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .
the new cabinet will be sworn into office on thursday in the bundestag . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .
the lpf never puts its chaos aside .

germany ’ s best-known living writer celebrates his 75th birthday on october 16 and shows no sign of slowing down . this week has seen a wave of tributes to the german writer and artist günter grass , who celebrates his 75th birthday on wednesday .
a towering literary figure in germany for the last four decades , grass has also used his prominence as a platform for incisive political commentary – most recently speaking out in favor of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition and against military action in iraq .
a danzig childhood the son of a grocer , grass grew up in danzig , in present day poland .
he joined the hitler youth in the 1930s and served in the german army during world war ii .
afterwards , he studied painting and sculpture and wrote verse and plays before publishing his hugely successful first novel , the tin drum in1959 .
a 1979 film version of the novel by german director volker schlöndorff was an international success and brought grass acclaim abroad .
like the two other works in the so-called “ danzig trilogy ” - katz und maus -lrb- “ cat and mouse , ” 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- “ dog years , ” 1963 -rrb- - the tin drum draws on the author ’ s early life in the german-polish port city .
“ books don ’ t just happen , ” grass told the german weekly die woche .
“ they are lived out in advance – and they take much longer to live out than they do to get written down . "
the conscience of the german federal republic history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ’ works .
he frequently refers to himself as a “ public moralist , ” and the german president , johannes rau , has called him “ the conscience of the res publica . ”
ein weites feld -lrb- “ too far afield , ” 1995 -rrb- was the first literary work by a prominent author to deal with german reunification , which grass opposed , referring to it as an “ annexation . ”
his latest novel , im krebsgang , -lrb- “ crabwalk , ” 2002 – english translation due in april 2003 -rrb- , broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii .
by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship “ wilhelm gustloff ” in the baltic , grass is able to trace the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like grass ’ earlier works , it underlines the author ’ s preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived .
the man the chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ one of the greatest writers of our time and a great patriot ” has been the recipient of numerous prestigious awards and honors , including the nobel prize for literature in 1999 .
this and his uncompromising political stance often detract from his success as a sculptor , graphic artist and painter .
a series of exhibitions covering the author ’ s activities opens at the " günter-grass-haus , " a museum dedicated to the writer ’ s life and work , in lübeck on october 20 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

in berlin , the waiting may soon be outdated as the city tests a cell phone system which allows people to just dial up and go . berlin ’ s public transport authority , the bvg , has joined up with telecommunications provider e-plus to field test a system which allows passengers the chance to buy and receive tickets through their mobile phones .
the offer currently only applies to full-price single tickets , which are valid for two hours , and to single-day tickets , and is limited to the two innermost transportation zones .
the electronic function is also only available to customers who have a full contract with e-plus .
“ free-and-easy ” contracts , where the telephone is topped up by buying a new card , are not eligible .
the bvg says that the pilot project will be extended to other mobile phone providers if it proves a success .
telepay project covers a number of countries the berlin field test is part of a wider european union project called telepay , which so far also involves various transport and telecom providers in france , italy and finland , as well as the electronics manufacturers ertico and siemens .
berlin is the first city in germany to take part in the project .
telepay is designed so that the customer simply sends a text message -lrb- sms -rrb- to a particular telephone number , depending on the sort of ticket he or she wants to buy .
he or she will then receive an answering text message in return which is actually the ticket purchased .
if the customer has to show the ticket to a bus driver , they just display the text message of the mobile phone ’ s screen , which is recognized as proof of the ticket purchase .
at the end of the month , the cost of the ticket appears on the customer ’ s mobile phone bill .
the pilot project , which runs until the end of the month , is intended to test the system ’ s technical functions – for example , the time it takes to get a ticket , or whether it is correctly billed .
but it will be also assessing human factors such as whether train guards and bus drivers can deal with the new type of ticket – let alone the customers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .

germany ’ s best-known living writer celebrates his 75th birthday on october 16 and shows no sign of slowing down . this week has seen a wave of tributes to the german writer and artist günter grass , who celebrates his 75th birthday on wednesday .
a towering literary figure in germany for the last four decades , grass has also used his prominence as a platform for incisive political commentary – most recently speaking out in favor of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition and against military action in iraq .
a danzig childhood the son of a grocer , grass grew up in danzig , in present day poland .
he joined the hitler youth in the 1930s and served in the german army during world war ii .
afterwards , he studied painting and sculpture and wrote verse and plays before publishing his hugely successful first novel , the tin drum in1959 .
a 1979 film version of the novel by german director volker schlöndorff was an international success and brought grass acclaim abroad .
like the two other works in the so-called “ danzig trilogy ” - katz und maus -lrb- “ cat and mouse , ” 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- “ dog years , ” 1963 -rrb- - the tin drum draws on the author ’ s early life in the german-polish port city .
“ books don ’ t just happen , ” grass told the german weekly die woche .
“ they are lived out in advance – and they take much longer to live out than they do to get written down . "
the conscience of the german federal republic history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ’ works .
he frequently refers to himself as a “ public moralist , ” and the german president , johannes rau , has called him “ the conscience of the res publica . ”
ein weites feld -lrb- “ too far afield , ” 1995 -rrb- was the first literary work by a prominent author to deal with german reunification , which grass opposed , referring to it as an “ annexation . ”
his latest novel , im krebsgang , -lrb- “ crabwalk , ” 2002 – english translation due in april 2003 -rrb- , broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii .
by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship “ wilhelm gustloff ” in the baltic , grass is able to trace the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like grass ’ earlier works , it underlines the author ’ s preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived .
the man the chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ one of the greatest writers of our time and a great patriot ” has been the recipient of numerous prestigious awards and honors , including the nobel prize for literature in 1999 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.10.2002 italian government under fire over fiat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many may be out of a job sooner rather than later italy 's government is under fire to save the country 's best known industrial symbol , fiat , which is in danger of being sold to the world 's biggest automaker , general motor corp. italy 's centre-right government is under increasing pressure amid a growing crisis at carmaker fiat which may cost thousands of jobs in some of italy 's poorest regions .
last week , fiat announced last week it would lay off some 8,100 jobs , around 20 per cent of its italian workforce , to cut capacities in an ongoing sales slump , and as part of plans to make fiat auto more attractive to a possible bidder .
italy 's biggest employer fiat workers staged nationwide strikes through last week , and are planning to continue with demonstrations on friday .
amid protests , prime minister silvio berlusconi met fiat executives on sunday to discuss possible state aid .
after hours of talks , berlusconi said in a statement the government was considering possibilities for " a strategic strengthening of the sector " , and that all the measures were " market solutions " , an apparent reference to concerns that italy could break european union rules if it resorted to the kind of direct protection otherwise given by previous italian governments .
" the industrial and financial plan " - due before the end of october – would allow for a " new path " to boost innovation and " improve " on existing fiat support plan , the statement said , adding it would " safeguard the manufacturing centres " .
under the plan , the government is considering extending an incentive plan to trade in old cars , but will also add more weight to direct help to workers and the company .
media reports over the weekend said the government might opt to inject the fiat group with cash or that fiat , which sold 20 per cent of fiat auto to general motors corp. in 2000 would otherwise have to sell the rest to the world 's biggest carmaker by 2004 .
best known symbol once europe 's biggest carmaker , fiat has been forced to cut jobs and output as sales of its once successful branch fiat auto slumped in italy .
the crisis is more than a matter of economic failure , as fiat still remains to be italy 's best know symbol worldwide .

last week , fiat announced last week it would lay off some 8,100 jobs , around 20 per cent of its italian workforce , to cut capacities in an ongoing sales slump , and as part of plans to make fiat auto more attractive to a possible bidder .
italy 's biggest employer fiat workers staged nationwide strikes through last week , and are planning to continue with demonstrations on friday .
amid protests , prime minister silvio berlusconi met fiat executives on sunday to discuss possible state aid .
after hours of talks , berlusconi said in a statement the government was considering possibilities for " a strategic strengthening of the sector " , and that all the measures were " market solutions " , an apparent reference to concerns that italy could break european union rules if it resorted to the kind of direct protection otherwise given by previous italian governments .
" the industrial and financial plan " - due before the end of october – would allow for a " new path " to boost innovation and " improve " on existing fiat support plan , the statement said , adding it would " safeguard the manufacturing centres " .
under the plan , the government is considering extending an incentive plan to trade in old cars , but will also add more weight to direct help to workers and the company .
media reports over the weekend said the government might opt to inject the fiat group with cash or that fiat , which sold 20 per cent of fiat auto to general motors corp. in 2000 would otherwise have to sell the rest to the world 's biggest carmaker by 2004 .
best known symbol once europe 's biggest carmaker , fiat has been forced to cut jobs and output as sales of its once successful branch fiat auto slumped in italy .
the crisis is more than a matter of economic failure , as fiat still remains to be italy 's best know symbol worldwide .

" we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.10.2002 introducing the ultimate in ticketless travel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dial up for a bus ticket have you ever been stuck waiting in line to buy a ticket for the bus or tram ?
in berlin , the waiting may soon be outdated as the city tests a cell phone system which allows people to just dial up and go . berlin ’ s public transport authority , the bvg , has joined up with telecommunications provider e-plus to field test a system which allows passengers the chance to buy and receive tickets through their mobile phones .
the offer currently only applies to full-price single tickets , which are valid for two hours , and to single-day tickets , and is limited to the two innermost transportation zones .
the electronic function is also only available to customers who have a full contract with e-plus .
“ free-and-easy ” contracts , where the telephone is topped up by buying a new card , are not eligible .
the bvg says that the pilot project will be extended to other mobile phone providers if it proves a success .
telepay project covers a number of countries the berlin field test is part of a wider european union project called telepay , which so far also involves various transport and telecom providers in france , italy and finland , as well as the electronics manufacturers ertico and siemens .
berlin is the first city in germany to take part in the project .
telepay is designed so that the customer simply sends a text message -lrb- sms -rrb- to a particular telephone number , depending on the sort of ticket he or she wants to buy .

the american chamber of commerce says the coalition will harm germany ’ s global economic position . german finance minister hans eichel sought to reassure his countrymen and women on tuesday that the austerity deal worked out between the social democrats and the greens will provide a solid basis for future growth .
however , the core component of the plan , the decision to increase taxes , has not been well received by the german and international business community , which fears the new changes will discourage investment .
one of the main points of criticism is the introduction of a minimum tax for large corporations , which would require a company to pay taxes on at least half of its profits .
only the second half could be offset by losses from previous years .
but industry lobbyists say companies recording losses should not have to pay taxes , because it reduces their profit margin and room for investment .
in the long-run , such a tax would hinder corporations ’ growth .
dieter hundt , president of the german employer ’ s association , told the “ financial times deutschland ” that the “ increase in taxes would hinder overall economic growth . ”
ludwig georg braun , president of the german association of industry , trade and commerce , told dw-tv that the current situation is one of “ unease , if not outright fear in the business sector , because there was no hint that this was going to take place . ”
criticism from international community the american chamber of commerce in germany has also criticized the coalition ’ s tax plans , saying they would discourage foreign investment and hamper overall economic growth .
“ the tax increases present a barrier to investment , which will have negative consequences for the entire economy , ” rainer mück , chair of the chamber ’ s tax committee , told the “ financial times deutschland . ”
especially harmful for long-term growth are the plans for limiting the amount of losses a company can deduct from annual profits prior to taxation .
“ here , profits will be taxed before they ’ ve even been made , ” mück said , referring to the new minimum tax requirement .
as a result foreign investors , who operate on a slim profit margin , will look to other locations outside of germany for setting up businesses .
hardly any other eu member state has a minimum tax on corporations , making it extremely difficult for germany to remain competitive .
“ in the context of the current unemployment situation , the question must be raised , whether germany can afford to institute such measures ” that ultimately send foreign employers else where , mück said .
currently , the american chamber of commerce in germany lists more than 3,000 members and is the largest bilateral business association in europe .

prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .

prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .

" we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .

in berlin , the waiting may soon be outdated as the city tests a cell phone system which allows people to just dial up and go . berlin ’ s public transport authority , the bvg , has joined up with telecommunications provider e-plus to field test a system which allows passengers the chance to buy and receive tickets through their mobile phones .
the offer currently only applies to full-price single tickets , which are valid for two hours , and to single-day tickets , and is limited to the two innermost transportation zones .
the electronic function is also only available to customers who have a full contract with e-plus .
“ free-and-easy ” contracts , where the telephone is topped up by buying a new card , are not eligible .
the bvg says that the pilot project will be extended to other mobile phone providers if it proves a success .
telepay project covers a number of countries the berlin field test is part of a wider european union project called telepay , which so far also involves various transport and telecom providers in france , italy and finland , as well as the electronics manufacturers ertico and siemens .
berlin is the first city in germany to take part in the project .
telepay is designed so that the customer simply sends a text message -lrb- sms -rrb- to a particular telephone number , depending on the sort of ticket he or she wants to buy .
he or she will then receive an answering text message in return which is actually the ticket purchased .
if the customer has to show the ticket to a bus driver , they just display the text message of the mobile phone ’ s screen , which is recognized as proof of the ticket purchase .
at the end of the month , the cost of the ticket appears on the customer ’ s mobile phone bill .
the pilot project , which runs until the end of the month , is intended to test the system ’ s technical functions – for example , the time it takes to get a ticket , or whether it is correctly billed .
but it will be also assessing human factors such as whether train guards and bus drivers can deal with the new type of ticket – let alone the customers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s best-known living writer celebrates his 75th birthday on october 16 and shows no sign of slowing down . this week has seen a wave of tributes to the german writer and artist günter grass , who celebrates his 75th birthday on wednesday .
a towering literary figure in germany for the last four decades , grass has also used his prominence as a platform for incisive political commentary – most recently speaking out in favor of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition and against military action in iraq .
a danzig childhood the son of a grocer , grass grew up in danzig , in present day poland .
he joined the hitler youth in the 1930s and served in the german army during world war ii .
afterwards , he studied painting and sculpture and wrote verse and plays before publishing his hugely successful first novel , the tin drum in1959 .
a 1979 film version of the novel by german director volker schlöndorff was an international success and brought grass acclaim abroad .
like the two other works in the so-called “ danzig trilogy ” - katz und maus -lrb- “ cat and mouse , ” 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- “ dog years , ” 1963 -rrb- - the tin drum draws on the author ’ s early life in the german-polish port city .
“ books don ’ t just happen , ” grass told the german weekly die woche .
“ they are lived out in advance – and they take much longer to live out than they do to get written down . "
the conscience of the german federal republic history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ’ works .
he frequently refers to himself as a “ public moralist , ” and the german president , johannes rau , has called him “ the conscience of the res publica . ”
ein weites feld -lrb- “ too far afield , ” 1995 -rrb- was the first literary work by a prominent author to deal with german reunification , which grass opposed , referring to it as an “ annexation . ”
his latest novel , im krebsgang , -lrb- “ crabwalk , ” 2002 – english translation due in april 2003 -rrb- , broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii .
by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship “ wilhelm gustloff ” in the baltic , grass is able to trace the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like grass ’ earlier works , it underlines the author ’ s preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived .
the man the chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ one of the greatest writers of our time and a great patriot ” has been the recipient of numerous prestigious awards and honors , including the nobel prize for literature in 1999 .
this and his uncompromising political stance often detract from his success as a sculptor , graphic artist and painter .
a series of exhibitions covering the author ’ s activities opens at the " günter-grass-haus , " a museum dedicated to the writer ’ s life and work , in lübeck on october 20 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the american chamber of commerce says the coalition will harm germany ’ s global economic position . german finance minister hans eichel sought to reassure his countrymen and women on tuesday that the austerity deal worked out between the social democrats and the greens will provide a solid basis for future growth .
however , the core component of the plan , the decision to increase taxes , has not been well received by the german and international business community , which fears the new changes will discourage investment .
one of the main points of criticism is the introduction of a minimum tax for large corporations , which would require a company to pay taxes on at least half of its profits .
only the second half could be offset by losses from previous years .
but industry lobbyists say companies recording losses should not have to pay taxes , because it reduces their profit margin and room for investment .
in the long-run , such a tax would hinder corporations ’ growth .
dieter hundt , president of the german employer ’ s association , told the “ financial times deutschland ” that the “ increase in taxes would hinder overall economic growth . ”
ludwig georg braun , president of the german association of industry , trade and commerce , told dw-tv that the current situation is one of “ unease , if not outright fear in the business sector , because there was no hint that this was going to take place . ”
criticism from international community the american chamber of commerce in germany has also criticized the coalition ’ s tax plans , saying they would discourage foreign investment and hamper overall economic growth .
“ the tax increases present a barrier to investment , which will have negative consequences for the entire economy , ” rainer mück , chair of the chamber ’ s tax committee , told the “ financial times deutschland . ”
especially harmful for long-term growth are the plans for limiting the amount of losses a company can deduct from annual profits prior to taxation .
“ here , profits will be taxed before they ’ ve even been made , ” mück said , referring to the new minimum tax requirement .
as a result foreign investors , who operate on a slim profit margin , will look to other locations outside of germany for setting up businesses .
hardly any other eu member state has a minimum tax on corporations , making it extremely difficult for germany to remain competitive .
“ in the context of the current unemployment situation , the question must be raised , whether germany can afford to institute such measures ” that ultimately send foreign employers else where , mück said .
currently , the american chamber of commerce in germany lists more than 3,000 members and is the largest bilateral business association in europe .
according to its statistics , the chamber represents the largest group of foreign investors in germany , investors who may be turned off by the new tax regulations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.10.2002 chancellor schröder announces germany ’ s new cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy times : gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and his deputy , joschka fischer after two weeks of negotiations , germany ’ s social democrats and greens have inked an agreement that maps what 's sure to be a rocky path for the next four years . " we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .

in berlin , the waiting may soon be outdated as the city tests a cell phone system which allows people to just dial up and go . berlin ’ s public transport authority , the bvg , has joined up with telecommunications provider e-plus to field test a system which allows passengers the chance to buy and receive tickets through their mobile phones .
the offer currently only applies to full-price single tickets , which are valid for two hours , and to single-day tickets , and is limited to the two innermost transportation zones .
the electronic function is also only available to customers who have a full contract with e-plus .
“ free-and-easy ” contracts , where the telephone is topped up by buying a new card , are not eligible .
the bvg says that the pilot project will be extended to other mobile phone providers if it proves a success .
telepay project covers a number of countries the berlin field test is part of a wider european union project called telepay , which so far also involves various transport and telecom providers in france , italy and finland , as well as the electronics manufacturers ertico and siemens .
berlin is the first city in germany to take part in the project .
telepay is designed so that the customer simply sends a text message -lrb- sms -rrb- to a particular telephone number , depending on the sort of ticket he or she wants to buy .
he or she will then receive an answering text message in return which is actually the ticket purchased .
if the customer has to show the ticket to a bus driver , they just display the text message of the mobile phone ’ s screen , which is recognized as proof of the ticket purchase .
at the end of the month , the cost of the ticket appears on the customer ’ s mobile phone bill .
the pilot project , which runs until the end of the month , is intended to test the system ’ s technical functions – for example , the time it takes to get a ticket , or whether it is correctly billed .
but it will be also assessing human factors such as whether train guards and bus drivers can deal with the new type of ticket – let alone the customers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s best-known living writer celebrates his 75th birthday on october 16 and shows no sign of slowing down . this week has seen a wave of tributes to the german writer and artist günter grass , who celebrates his 75th birthday on wednesday .
a towering literary figure in germany for the last four decades , grass has also used his prominence as a platform for incisive political commentary – most recently speaking out in favor of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition and against military action in iraq .
a danzig childhood the son of a grocer , grass grew up in danzig , in present day poland .
he joined the hitler youth in the 1930s and served in the german army during world war ii .
afterwards , he studied painting and sculpture and wrote verse and plays before publishing his hugely successful first novel , the tin drum in1959 .
a 1979 film version of the novel by german director volker schlöndorff was an international success and brought grass acclaim abroad .
like the two other works in the so-called “ danzig trilogy ” - katz und maus -lrb- “ cat and mouse , ” 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- “ dog years , ” 1963 -rrb- - the tin drum draws on the author ’ s early life in the german-polish port city .
“ books don ’ t just happen , ” grass told the german weekly die woche .
“ they are lived out in advance – and they take much longer to live out than they do to get written down . "
the conscience of the german federal republic history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ’ works .
he frequently refers to himself as a “ public moralist , ” and the german president , johannes rau , has called him “ the conscience of the res publica . ”
ein weites feld -lrb- “ too far afield , ” 1995 -rrb- was the first literary work by a prominent author to deal with german reunification , which grass opposed , referring to it as an “ annexation . ”
his latest novel , im krebsgang , -lrb- “ crabwalk , ” 2002 – english translation due in april 2003 -rrb- , broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii .
by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship “ wilhelm gustloff ” in the baltic , grass is able to trace the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like grass ’ earlier works , it underlines the author ’ s preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived .
the man the chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ one of the greatest writers of our time and a great patriot ” has been the recipient of numerous prestigious awards and honors , including the nobel prize for literature in 1999 .
this and his uncompromising political stance often detract from his success as a sculptor , graphic artist and painter .

germany ’ s best-known living writer celebrates his 75th birthday on october 16 and shows no sign of slowing down . this week has seen a wave of tributes to the german writer and artist günter grass , who celebrates his 75th birthday on wednesday .
a towering literary figure in germany for the last four decades , grass has also used his prominence as a platform for incisive political commentary – most recently speaking out in favor of chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s red-green coalition and against military action in iraq .
a danzig childhood the son of a grocer , grass grew up in danzig , in present day poland .
he joined the hitler youth in the 1930s and served in the german army during world war ii .
afterwards , he studied painting and sculpture and wrote verse and plays before publishing his hugely successful first novel , the tin drum in1959 .
a 1979 film version of the novel by german director volker schlöndorff was an international success and brought grass acclaim abroad .
like the two other works in the so-called “ danzig trilogy ” - katz und maus -lrb- “ cat and mouse , ” 1961 -rrb- and hundejahre -lrb- “ dog years , ” 1963 -rrb- - the tin drum draws on the author ’ s early life in the german-polish port city .
“ books don ’ t just happen , ” grass told the german weekly die woche .
“ they are lived out in advance – and they take much longer to live out than they do to get written down . "
the conscience of the german federal republic history and politics are closely intertwined in all of grass ’ works .
he frequently refers to himself as a “ public moralist , ” and the german president , johannes rau , has called him “ the conscience of the res publica . ”
ein weites feld -lrb- “ too far afield , ” 1995 -rrb- was the first literary work by a prominent author to deal with german reunification , which grass opposed , referring to it as an “ annexation . ”
his latest novel , im krebsgang , -lrb- “ crabwalk , ” 2002 – english translation due in april 2003 -rrb- , broke a long-held taboo in german literature by focusing on the suffering of german expellees after world war ii .
by highlighting a single event in 1945 , the sinking of the refugee ship “ wilhelm gustloff ” in the baltic , grass is able to trace the history of a few key characters through the generations up to the present-day portrayal of the tragedy on neo-nazi web sites .
like grass ’ earlier works , it underlines the author ’ s preoccupation with the way past and present are connected and perceived .
the man the chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ one of the greatest writers of our time and a great patriot ” has been the recipient of numerous prestigious awards and honors , including the nobel prize for literature in 1999 .
this and his uncompromising political stance often detract from his success as a sculptor , graphic artist and painter .

the american chamber of commerce says the coalition will harm germany ’ s global economic position . german finance minister hans eichel sought to reassure his countrymen and women on tuesday that the austerity deal worked out between the social democrats and the greens will provide a solid basis for future growth .
however , the core component of the plan , the decision to increase taxes , has not been well received by the german and international business community , which fears the new changes will discourage investment .
one of the main points of criticism is the introduction of a minimum tax for large corporations , which would require a company to pay taxes on at least half of its profits .
only the second half could be offset by losses from previous years .
but industry lobbyists say companies recording losses should not have to pay taxes , because it reduces their profit margin and room for investment .
in the long-run , such a tax would hinder corporations ’ growth .
dieter hundt , president of the german employer ’ s association , told the “ financial times deutschland ” that the “ increase in taxes would hinder overall economic growth . ”
ludwig georg braun , president of the german association of industry , trade and commerce , told dw-tv that the current situation is one of “ unease , if not outright fear in the business sector , because there was no hint that this was going to take place . ”
criticism from international community the american chamber of commerce in germany has also criticized the coalition ’ s tax plans , saying they would discourage foreign investment and hamper overall economic growth .
“ the tax increases present a barrier to investment , which will have negative consequences for the entire economy , ” rainer mück , chair of the chamber ’ s tax committee , told the “ financial times deutschland . ”
especially harmful for long-term growth are the plans for limiting the amount of losses a company can deduct from annual profits prior to taxation .
“ here , profits will be taxed before they ’ ve even been made , ” mück said , referring to the new minimum tax requirement .
as a result foreign investors , who operate on a slim profit margin , will look to other locations outside of germany for setting up businesses .
hardly any other eu member state has a minimum tax on corporations , making it extremely difficult for germany to remain competitive .
“ in the context of the current unemployment situation , the question must be raised , whether germany can afford to institute such measures ” that ultimately send foreign employers else where , mück said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.10.2002 chancellor schröder announces germany ’ s new cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy times : gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and his deputy , joschka fischer after two weeks of negotiations , germany ’ s social democrats and greens have inked an agreement that maps what 's sure to be a rocky path for the next four years . " we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .
the new cabinet will be sworn into office on thursday in the bundestag . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .
the new cabinet will be sworn into office on thursday in the bundestag . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the american chamber of commerce says the coalition will harm germany ’ s global economic position . german finance minister hans eichel sought to reassure his countrymen and women on tuesday that the austerity deal worked out between the social democrats and the greens will provide a solid basis for future growth .
however , the core component of the plan , the decision to increase taxes , has not been well received by the german and international business community , which fears the new changes will discourage investment .
one of the main points of criticism is the introduction of a minimum tax for large corporations , which would require a company to pay taxes on at least half of its profits .
only the second half could be offset by losses from previous years .
but industry lobbyists say companies recording losses should not have to pay taxes , because it reduces their profit margin and room for investment .
in the long-run , such a tax would hinder corporations ’ growth .
dieter hundt , president of the german employer ’ s association , told the “ financial times deutschland ” that the “ increase in taxes would hinder overall economic growth . ”
ludwig georg braun , president of the german association of industry , trade and commerce , told dw-tv that the current situation is one of “ unease , if not outright fear in the business sector , because there was no hint that this was going to take place . ”
criticism from international community the american chamber of commerce in germany has also criticized the coalition ’ s tax plans , saying they would discourage foreign investment and hamper overall economic growth .
“ the tax increases present a barrier to investment , which will have negative consequences for the entire economy , ” rainer mück , chair of the chamber ’ s tax committee , told the “ financial times deutschland . ”
especially harmful for long-term growth are the plans for limiting the amount of losses a company can deduct from annual profits prior to taxation .
“ here , profits will be taxed before they ’ ve even been made , ” mück said , referring to the new minimum tax requirement .
as a result foreign investors , who operate on a slim profit margin , will look to other locations outside of germany for setting up businesses .
hardly any other eu member state has a minimum tax on corporations , making it extremely difficult for germany to remain competitive .
“ in the context of the current unemployment situation , the question must be raised , whether germany can afford to institute such measures ” that ultimately send foreign employers else where , mück said .
currently , the american chamber of commerce in germany lists more than 3,000 members and is the largest bilateral business association in europe .
according to its statistics , the chamber represents the largest group of foreign investors in germany , investors who may be turned off by the new tax regulations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

last week , fiat announced last week it would lay off some 8,100 jobs , around 20 per cent of its italian workforce , to cut capacities in an ongoing sales slump , and as part of plans to make fiat auto more attractive to a possible bidder .
italy 's biggest employer fiat workers staged nationwide strikes through last week , and are planning to continue with demonstrations on friday .
amid protests , prime minister silvio berlusconi met fiat executives on sunday to discuss possible state aid .
after hours of talks , berlusconi said in a statement the government was considering possibilities for " a strategic strengthening of the sector " , and that all the measures were " market solutions " , an apparent reference to concerns that italy could break european union rules if it resorted to the kind of direct protection otherwise given by previous italian governments .
" the industrial and financial plan " - due before the end of october – would allow for a " new path " to boost innovation and " improve " on existing fiat support plan , the statement said , adding it would " safeguard the manufacturing centres " .
under the plan , the government is considering extending an incentive plan to trade in old cars , but will also add more weight to direct help to workers and the company .
media reports over the weekend said the government might opt to inject the fiat group with cash or that fiat , which sold 20 per cent of fiat auto to general motors corp. in 2000 would otherwise have to sell the rest to the world 's biggest carmaker by 2004 .
best known symbol once europe 's biggest carmaker , fiat has been forced to cut jobs and output as sales of its once successful branch fiat auto slumped in italy .
the crisis is more than a matter of economic failure , as fiat still remains to be italy 's best know symbol worldwide .
despite its steady decline in sales and increasing losses , fiat still remains italy 's biggest private sector employer .
without state aid , thousands will lose their jobs across the country .
worst hit will be southern italy where two of fiat 's italian car plants , including sicily , one of europe 's poorest regions , face closure .
here , unemployment levels are up to 27 per cent , compared to a 9 per cent national average .

in berlin , the waiting may soon be outdated as the city tests a cell phone system which allows people to just dial up and go . berlin ’ s public transport authority , the bvg , has joined up with telecommunications provider e-plus to field test a system which allows passengers the chance to buy and receive tickets through their mobile phones .
the offer currently only applies to full-price single tickets , which are valid for two hours , and to single-day tickets , and is limited to the two innermost transportation zones .
the electronic function is also only available to customers who have a full contract with e-plus .
“ free-and-easy ” contracts , where the telephone is topped up by buying a new card , are not eligible .
the bvg says that the pilot project will be extended to other mobile phone providers if it proves a success .
telepay project covers a number of countries the berlin field test is part of a wider european union project called telepay , which so far also involves various transport and telecom providers in france , italy and finland , as well as the electronics manufacturers ertico and siemens .
berlin is the first city in germany to take part in the project .
telepay is designed so that the customer simply sends a text message -lrb- sms -rrb- to a particular telephone number , depending on the sort of ticket he or she wants to buy .
he or she will then receive an answering text message in return which is actually the ticket purchased .
if the customer has to show the ticket to a bus driver , they just display the text message of the mobile phone ’ s screen , which is recognized as proof of the ticket purchase .
at the end of the month , the cost of the ticket appears on the customer ’ s mobile phone bill .
the pilot project , which runs until the end of the month , is intended to test the system ’ s technical functions – for example , the time it takes to get a ticket , or whether it is correctly billed .
but it will be also assessing human factors such as whether train guards and bus drivers can deal with the new type of ticket – let alone the customers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

last week , fiat announced last week it would lay off some 8,100 jobs , around 20 per cent of its italian workforce , to cut capacities in an ongoing sales slump , and as part of plans to make fiat auto more attractive to a possible bidder .
italy 's biggest employer fiat workers staged nationwide strikes through last week , and are planning to continue with demonstrations on friday .
amid protests , prime minister silvio berlusconi met fiat executives on sunday to discuss possible state aid .
after hours of talks , berlusconi said in a statement the government was considering possibilities for " a strategic strengthening of the sector " , and that all the measures were " market solutions " , an apparent reference to concerns that italy could break european union rules if it resorted to the kind of direct protection otherwise given by previous italian governments .
" the industrial and financial plan " - due before the end of october – would allow for a " new path " to boost innovation and " improve " on existing fiat support plan , the statement said , adding it would " safeguard the manufacturing centres " .
under the plan , the government is considering extending an incentive plan to trade in old cars , but will also add more weight to direct help to workers and the company .
media reports over the weekend said the government might opt to inject the fiat group with cash or that fiat , which sold 20 per cent of fiat auto to general motors corp. in 2000 would otherwise have to sell the rest to the world 's biggest carmaker by 2004 .
best known symbol once europe 's biggest carmaker , fiat has been forced to cut jobs and output as sales of its once successful branch fiat auto slumped in italy .
the crisis is more than a matter of economic failure , as fiat still remains to be italy 's best know symbol worldwide .
despite its steady decline in sales and increasing losses , fiat still remains italy 's biggest private sector employer .
without state aid , thousands will lose their jobs across the country .

the american chamber of commerce says the coalition will harm germany ’ s global economic position . german finance minister hans eichel sought to reassure his countrymen and women on tuesday that the austerity deal worked out between the social democrats and the greens will provide a solid basis for future growth .
however , the core component of the plan , the decision to increase taxes , has not been well received by the german and international business community , which fears the new changes will discourage investment .
one of the main points of criticism is the introduction of a minimum tax for large corporations , which would require a company to pay taxes on at least half of its profits .
only the second half could be offset by losses from previous years .
but industry lobbyists say companies recording losses should not have to pay taxes , because it reduces their profit margin and room for investment .
in the long-run , such a tax would hinder corporations ’ growth .
dieter hundt , president of the german employer ’ s association , told the “ financial times deutschland ” that the “ increase in taxes would hinder overall economic growth . ”
ludwig georg braun , president of the german association of industry , trade and commerce , told dw-tv that the current situation is one of “ unease , if not outright fear in the business sector , because there was no hint that this was going to take place . ”
criticism from international community the american chamber of commerce in germany has also criticized the coalition ’ s tax plans , saying they would discourage foreign investment and hamper overall economic growth .
“ the tax increases present a barrier to investment , which will have negative consequences for the entire economy , ” rainer mück , chair of the chamber ’ s tax committee , told the “ financial times deutschland . ”
especially harmful for long-term growth are the plans for limiting the amount of losses a company can deduct from annual profits prior to taxation .
“ here , profits will be taxed before they ’ ve even been made , ” mück said , referring to the new minimum tax requirement .
as a result foreign investors , who operate on a slim profit margin , will look to other locations outside of germany for setting up businesses .
hardly any other eu member state has a minimum tax on corporations , making it extremely difficult for germany to remain competitive .
“ in the context of the current unemployment situation , the question must be raised , whether germany can afford to institute such measures ” that ultimately send foreign employers else where , mück said .
currently , the american chamber of commerce in germany lists more than 3,000 members and is the largest bilateral business association in europe .
according to its statistics , the chamber represents the largest group of foreign investors in germany , investors who may be turned off by the new tax regulations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.10.2002 dutch coalition government resigns after three months großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : little to smile about : prime minister jan-peter balkenende after just three months in office , the dutch coalition government collapsed on wednesday amid tales of in-fighting between members of murdered populist politician pim fortuyn 's lpf party . internal feuding has been blamed for the collapse of the dutch parliament 's coalition government after just three months in office .
prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .
the lpf never puts its chaos aside .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.10.2002 chancellor schröder announces germany ’ s new cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy times : gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and his deputy , joschka fischer after two weeks of negotiations , germany ’ s social democrats and greens have inked an agreement that maps what 's sure to be a rocky path for the next four years . " we did it ! " exclaimed a triumphant chancellor gerhard schröder before signing the 88-page coalition agreement in berlin ’ s new national gallery on wednesday .
the paper is the result of twelve rounds of negotiations between schröder ’ s social democrats and their junior partner the greens .
at the crux of the agreement is a tax and savings plan that requires businesses and high wage earners to pay more , while families and the environment stand to benefit .
in the next four years , the government aims to boost germany ’ s flagging economy while at the same time slashing spending to fill a 14.2 billion euro gap in the budget .
the majority of it , 11.6 billion euro , will come from across the board cuts .
the burden of the new tax reform will fall largely on businesses and high income earners .
corporations and investment trusts will be required to pay a minimum tax .
furthermore , companies ’ rights to carry forward losses and deduct them from before-tax profits will be limited .
social security payments will increase too , while people with higher incomes will have to contribute more to the state pension system .
on the other side of the economic spectrum , the agreement establishes new policies intended to benefit working parents .
through the increased taxes collected from corporations , more money will flow back to the communities to help finance an increase in the number of day care centers for small children .
subsidies for home ownership will remain for families , but will no longer apply to people without children .
the coalition plan also addresses environmental concerns by committing the government to work towards reducing the amount of environmentally-harmful emissions in the eu to 30 percent by 2020 .
if this target is reached , germany will reduce its own emissions by 40 percent in relation to its 1990 levels .
influence concentrated on a few the cabinet reshuffle has shifted focus to four ministers , hans eichel , wolfgang clement , manfred stolpe and peter struck , who are expected to play the greatest roles in shaping this government ’ s term .
it ’ s likely , however , that finance minister eichel -lrb- spd -rrb- will loose some of his influence now that the coalition has agreed to concentrate on boosting the economy and lowering unemployment , as opposed to relying primarily on saving .
the new " super-minister " wolfgang clement -lrb- spd -rrb- , responsible for both the labor and economics ministries , will play a key position in the next four years .
not only will the former state premier of north rhine westphalia have to fuse two previously independent ministries , he will also have to tackle the government ’ s main priorities : bringing life into the economy and creating jobs. v east german manfred stolpe -lrb- spd -rrb- , also a " super-minister , " takes over the portfolio for transportation and construction along with the added responsibility for eastern german development .
stolpe ’ s designation as minister came after vociferous calls , in particular from eastern german members of the spd , that someone east of the elbe be responsible for the portfolio .
the former state premier of brandenburg will be vying for funds , as his main job will consist of distributing money to the eastern german states .
defense minister peter struck has stayed in his recently appointed position and is expected to wield significant influence in the cabinet .
as the former spd coalition leader in parliament , struck is well-regarded among parliamentarians .
although his ministry commands one of the highest budgets in the government and is continually asking for more , the defense minister can still rely on support from his former colleagues in the bundestag .
nine of the thirteen members of the chancellor ’ s last cabinet have kept their jobs .
among them , foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- green -rrb- , the country ’ s most popular politician , and interior minister otto schily -lrb- spd -rrb- .
greens have more leverage thanks to the green party ’ s good showing in the election , it had more leverage in coalition talks with the spd this time around .
instead of insisting on further ministries , however , the greens opted for more influence elsewhere .
cabinet members , jürgen trittin -lrb- environment -rrb- and renate kunäst -lrb- consumer affairs -rrb- , have both received enlarged portfolios .
trittin is now responsible for renewable energy , and künast is adding genetic engineering on plants to her list of competencies .
other leading green politicians have moved into high positions in the foreign office and in wolfgang clement ’ s ministry .
in addition to the new cabinet members clement and stolpe , former bavarian spd leader renate schmidt will be the new head of the ministry for family , while interior ministry state secretary brigitte zypries -lrb- spd -rrb- assumes the job of justice minister .
the new cabinet will be sworn into office on thursday in the bundestag . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

prime minister jan-peter balkenende spoke to parliament on wednesday and said that he would offer queen beatrix his government 's resignation after describing the conflicts within the coalition as " unacceptable " .
balkenende was responsible for putting together the delicate coalition involving his own christian democrats , the populist lpf and the liberal vvf party , after elections in may .
new elections in january on wednesday , the prime minister dissolved the shortest-lived dutch administration since world war ii saying the in-fighting had proven to be too much of a distraction and had hindered the government from carrying out important business .
the dutch population will be asked to vote again in new elections expected in january next year .
although the main argument cited for the collapse centred on the expansion of the european union , the three-party coalition had been divided by a power struggle between two ministers from pim fortuyn 's lpf party .
the lpf , without the charismatic fortuyn , its murdered leader , found itself plagued by arguments and back-stabbing over issues surrounding the party 's future direction and organisation .
fortuyn was shot dead in may only nine days before the election .
the lpf went on to take second place to the christian democrats winning 26 seats in the 150-seat parliament on an anti-immigration platform .
the two lpf members accused of instigating and pursuing the feud , eduard bomhoff and herman heinsbroek , were originally granted senior cabinet seats in the coalition but were rumoured to be fighting a bitter personal feud within their own party for control .
the two ministers resigned early on wednesday but their actions came too late to save the government .
heinsbroek left parliament telling the assembled press that he could no longer work with the coalition as a minister for the lpf .
he called his party " unworkable " and said that the arguments had stemmed from the fact that the lpf was still young and full of people with so many different visions .
" unmanageable situation " after the resignation of the lpf ministers , gerrit zalm , the leader of the liberal vvd party , the third in the coalition , immediately called for the entire government to resign and called for new elections .
the vvd , along with the christian democrats , refused to continue working work with the lpf even though the offending ministers had quit their posts .
this left prime minister jan-peter balkenende with little choice .
" we need new elections as soon as possible , " said vvd leader gerrit zalm to reporters .
" the situation has become unmanageable .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- private finance spending to fall news sport weather world service a-z index search you are in : business news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business e-commerce economy market data entertainment science / nature technology health - talking point - country profiles in depth - programmes - services daily e-mail news ticker mobile / pdas - text only feedback help editions change to uk thursday , 17 october , 2002 , 05:23 gmt 06:23 uk private finance spending to fall by steve schifferes bbc news online economics reporter the government 's reliance on private finance for funding the building of public hospitals , roads and schools is set to fall .
the value of projects commissioned under the controversial private finance initiative -lrb- pfi -rrb- will drop from £ 3.5bn this year to £ 2.9bn by 2005/6 , geoffrey spence , head of the treasury 's private finance unit , said .
the figure excludes £ 1bn spent each year by the government on modernising london underground , and about £ 300m on the channel tunnel rail link .
nonetheless , pfi spending will account for less than 10 % of total public investment by 2006 .
' stringent tests ' the statement follows a revolt , spearheaded by unions , over pfi at the labour party conference two weeks ago .
critics have claimed that initiative brings huge profits to the private sector firms contracted , at the expense of taxpayers .
but paul boateng , chief secretary to the treasury , said the initiative met " stringent tests for value for money " .
the government 's priority was to " see new hospitals , schools , transport infrastructure and other projects delivered quickly to the highest standard , on time and to budget " .
in the 1975-95 period , before pfi was employed , the average public sector project cost 47 % more than planned , and was completed on average 16 months late .
" opponents of change have mounted a determined and sometimes strident campaign , " he said .
" we must meet their arguments head on . "
concession at the same time the government has moved to allay critics of pfi who feared it was a licence for private companies to make profits .
peter gershon , chief executive of the office of government commerce , announced that from now on the public sector would get at least 30 % of profits from refinancing any pfi deal .
paul boateng told the bbc : " this gives a fair deal for everyone .
" it will be widely welcomed both within the government and the private sector . "
in the past some private companies who have received a fixed monthly fee from the government , in return for building and running a school or a hospital , have been able to increase their profits by renegotiating with their banks a lower interest rate after the deal has been signed .
the government had already announced that all future pfi deals must return at least 50 % to the public sector in this circumstance .
under the new deal , which has been agreed with the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- , the public sector will also benefit from a significant share of the profits from already existing pfi projects .

the value of projects commissioned under the controversial private finance initiative -lrb- pfi -rrb- will drop from £ 3.5bn this year to £ 2.9bn by 2005/6 , geoffrey spence , head of the treasury 's private finance unit , said .
the figure excludes £ 1bn spent each year by the government on modernising london underground , and about £ 300m on the channel tunnel rail link .
nonetheless , pfi spending will account for less than 10 % of total public investment by 2006 .
' stringent tests ' the statement follows a revolt , spearheaded by unions , over pfi at the labour party conference two weeks ago .
critics have claimed that initiative brings huge profits to the private sector firms contracted , at the expense of taxpayers .
but paul boateng , chief secretary to the treasury , said the initiative met " stringent tests for value for money " .
the government 's priority was to " see new hospitals , schools , transport infrastructure and other projects delivered quickly to the highest standard , on time and to budget " .
in the 1975-95 period , before pfi was employed , the average public sector project cost 47 % more than planned , and was completed on average 16 months late .
" opponents of change have mounted a determined and sometimes strident campaign , " he said .
" we must meet their arguments head on . "
concession at the same time the government has moved to allay critics of pfi who feared it was a licence for private companies to make profits .
peter gershon , chief executive of the office of government commerce , announced that from now on the public sector would get at least 30 % of profits from refinancing any pfi deal .
paul boateng told the bbc : " this gives a fair deal for everyone .
" it will be widely welcomed both within the government and the private sector . "
in the past some private companies who have received a fixed monthly fee from the government , in return for building and running a school or a hospital , have been able to increase their profits by renegotiating with their banks a lower interest rate after the deal has been signed .
the government had already announced that all future pfi deals must return at least 50 % to the public sector in this circumstance .
under the new deal , which has been agreed with the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- , the public sector will also benefit from a significant share of the profits from already existing pfi projects .
