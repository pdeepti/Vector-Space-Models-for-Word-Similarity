there is no alternative if we are to keep control of the flow of people into this country prime minister john howard the government has lifted a ban on the processing of claims from afghan detainees in a move aimed at easing the growing tension inside the remote camp in the southern australian desert .
the authorities also released around 20 woomera detainees after their refugee claims were accepted .
but mr howard , in his first public comments on 10 days of turmoil at a controversial outback camp for illegal immigrants , said the decision to start assessing the asylum claims did not amount to a cave-in to the protestors .
" we do n't like having to detain people , " mr howard told channel nine television in an interview .
" but there is no alternative if we are to keep control of the flow of people into this country .
i want to make it very clear that we do n't intend to abandon the detention policy . "
' worse than jail ' detainees in the six camps spread around the country are locked up for months , even years , while the authorities decide whether they are genuine refugees .
according to mr howard , releasing them to live in the community would only encourage more asylum seekers to come to australia .
detainees who were released said woomera was " worse than a jail " .
" the news media of australia call us illegal immigrants .
that is not true , we are not queue jumpers , not illegal immigrants , we are asylum seekers , " iranian babak ahmadi , who spent 20 months in woomera , told the reuters news agency .
suicide attempts the crisis has escalated after another 15 inmates attempted suicide or self-mutilation .
at least 44 inmates , including one child , had their lips sewn together as part of their protest .
detainees have tried to poison or harm themselves this week several detainees have tried to hang themselves with bed sheets - including a 16-year-old boy .
others have swallowed shampoo and painkillers .
cyrus sarang , the head of the refugee action collective , told reuters that an inmate had called him to say protesters were slashing themselves with knives .
" really horrible things are happening here .
many of them are trying to hang themselves , kill themselves or cut themselves , " the asylum seeker said , according to mr sarang .
cruel conditions the compound is surrounded by a giant perimeter fence and is patrolled by security guards .
the bbc 's phil mercer in woomera says that the steel roofs of the blocks housing the detainees can be seen shimmering in the blistering desert heat .
several buildings within the holding centre have been damaged temperatures reach the high thirties , and the red desert dust is constantly whipped up by the wind .
a banner draped over a nearby road sign illustrates the hostility some local residents feel towards their reluctant neighbours .
it urges the asylum seekers to go home .
" no visa " , says the banner - " tell your friends " .
an editorial in an influential australian newspaper , however , makes a plea for compassion .
the sydney morning herald says the people of this country should carefully reflect what the paper calls " the brutal treatment of asylum seekers " .
over the past two years , some 8,000 boatpeople arrived in australia , a relatively small number .

one panel interrogated andersen officials over the shredding of documents relating to enron 's collapse .
but lawmakers were frustrated by the refusal of sacked partner david duncan - who is accused of destroying the documents by his former employer - to testify .
the key issues political impact : top-level political links with bush administration , and republican and democratic parties accounting process : company used complex financial partnerships to conceal debt .
shares tumbled when this emerged , leading to bankruptcy fraud : executives investigated for insider dealing and shredding documents .
employees lost billions due to ban on selling stock enron scandal at a glance " we certainly have not found out today the answer to the burning question , which was why those documents were destroyed , " said billy tauzin , chairman of the full house energy and commerce committee .
meanwhile a senate hearing was looking into the role of the regulators , and whether they could have done more to prevent enron 's collapse .
thursday 's hearings were one of many scheduled over the next six weeks as congress probes the biggest collapse in us corporate history .
shredding claim andersen told the house energy and commerce subcommittee that mr duncan , enron 's chief auditor , had purposefully ordered the destruction of a " very substantial volume of documents " .
sacked andersen partner david duncan has refused to testify dorsey baskin , managing director of andersen 's professional standards group , said the accountancy firm was " not proud " of the shredding of the documents .
but he said andersen " did the right thing " by revealing that documents had been destroyed , " although the firm was well aware of the potentially devastating impact this discovery could have on our reputation " .
mr duncan , who was fired by andersen earlier this month , invoked his constitutional right not to testify and declined to answer any questions .
he has previously said , through his lawyer , that he had done nothing improper .
mr duncan 's silence hampered " the important work of this committee in our search for the truth " , said mr greenwood , the panel 's chairman .
" enron robbed the bank , arthur andersen provided the getaway car and they say you were at the wheel , " mr greenwood told mr duncan .
delay but some doubted that mr duncan was totally to blame .
" it is perplexing to me that no one in the highest management of arthur andersen had any indication ... of what was going on , " said committee member chris john .
enron chairman kenneth lay resigned on wednesday and lawmakers were puzzled why it took until 10 november for andersen in-house lawyer nancy temple to send a memo to mr duncan and other enron staff telling to preserve relevant documents .
by this time the us securities and exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- had already begun an informal investigation into enron 's accounting practices .
but ms temple said she was not aware that papers were being shredded .
" i never counselled any destruction of documents , " she said .
independence ' compromised ' meanwhile the senate governmental affairs committee is looking into the role of the regulators , and whether they should have done more to prevent the collapse .
the former chairman of the sec arthur levitt called on auditors to re-examine their relationships with their clients .
" it 's well past time to recognise that the accounting profession 's independence has been compromised , " he said .
the committee 's chairman joseph lieberman said he hoped the panel would ultimately be able to recommend changes in law and regulation to " strengthen the watchdogs in and out of the federal government so that nothing like the enron scandal ever happens again . "
chairman resigns the hearings come the day after kenneth lay resigned as enron chief executive and chairman .
mr lay , who had run enron since it was founded in 1986 and is close to senior members of the bush administration , said the investigations into the collapse had left him unable to concentrate on rescuing the company .
" i want to see enron survive , " said mr lay , who will remain a director .
" and for that to happen we need someone at the helm who can focus 100 % of his efforts on reorganising the company .

the company unveiled operating profits of 158bn yen -lrb- $ 1.2bn , £ 824m -rrb- for the last three months of 2001 , a 10 % jump on the previous quarter , and well above its 120bn yen target .
net profits were down quarter on quarter , at 64bn yen , but still beat estimates in what most analysts had said would be a lean year for the japanese electronics firm .
the company was also helped by the weak yen , since the bulk of its sales are to the export market .
happy holidays christmas trade , especially in the us , was much brisker than some analysts had expected .
more than 5 million playstation 2 consoles were sold over the season , with sales in japan and north america running at twice the level of a year before .

sony gambled that the 11 september attacks would encourage us consumers to spend more time at home , boosting demand for its dvd , video , audio and games equipment .
in sony 's electronics division , double-digit percentage gains in sales of home entertainment products were offset by a slump in demand for its semiconductors and telecom products .
music and movies slow less encouraging , however , were results from the firm 's music and film businesses , which it expanded hugely in the 1990s .
sales in both were almost entirely flat , and the firm admitted that some of its biggest box-office releases had been poorly timed .

in music , the firm said , " weak industry conditions persist worldwide , digital piracy continues to escalate , and the september 2001 terrorist attacks in the us negatively affected market demand . "

by bbc economics analyst steve coulter the latest set of uk economic data on friday morning is expected to shatter the perception that the uk is immune to the global economic slowdown .
the gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- figures for the last three months of 2001 will reveal a sharply slowing economy as uk manufacturing reels from the loss of export markets in the us and elsewhere .
leading economists , including the national institute for economic and social research , a think tank , say that the uk economy probably stagnated in the aftermath of 11 september .
the news will be a further headache for the government , and will pile pressure on the bank of england to cut the cost of borrowing yet again .
economists at city firm capital economics said : " there is even a chance they will show the economy shrinking for the first time in a decade . "
no more cruising along even if the figures from the office for national statistics show the uk has avoided this , there will be widespread dismay at the dramatic turnaround in the economy 's fortunes .
uk manufacturing has been suffering for years gdp figures for the previous quarter , covering july to september , showed the economy growing at an annual rate of 2.2 % .
this was only marginally below what the treasury considers the to be uk 's long-term trend rate .
manufacturing has been in the doldrums for over a year .
this week the confederation of british industry warned that a further 50,000 metal-bashing jobs could go in the first few months of this year .
and there are signs that the service sector , which now accounts for nearly 80 % of the economy , is also slowing fast .
only the construction industry continues to power ahead .
recession looming ?
unemployment is edging up again after a steady decline over the past eight years , and the number of dole claimants could rise back above 1 million again before summer .
the housing market is showing no signs of collapse , but record levels of personal debt have worried some lenders .
it is important not to overdo the gloom , however .
a single quarter of low or static growth does not mean the uk is in recession .
this is officially defined as two successive quarters of declining output .
even stagnation in the last quarter of 2001 would still mean the uk economy recorded 1.6 % growth over the whole year , a figure almost certainly higher than that in the us , japan and germany .
threat to government spending but a low figure would throw chancellor gordon brown 's economic forecasts into doubt .
in his pre-budget report in november , mr brown confidently predicted a 2.25 % growth rate for 2001 .
although he has confounded his critics before , this now looks most unlikely to be achieved .
and these forecasts are the foundations on which the government bases its plans for public spending and taxation .
if the uk economy continues to underperform , labour 's plans to spend big on the health service could be threatened .

the israeli government is fully responsible for what will happen to the israeli people - disasters as a consequence of these attacks hamas member mahmoud al-zahar a hamas leader in gaza described hamdan 's killing as a " drop in the sea of israeli crimes " .
" israel has forgotten that there are retaliations to these attacks , " mahmoud al-zahar , told the reuters news agency .
" the message ... is that the israeli government is fully responsible for what will happen to the israeli people - disasters as a consequence of these attacks . "
thursday 's incidents on thursday night , israel said it killed two palestinians who were trying to infiltrate a jewish settlement in the southern gaza strip .
palestinian security sources said the israeli army told them they were ready to hand over the bodies of the two men .
the killings came just hours after hamdan was killed by missiles fired from israeli helicopter gunships in the southern gaza town of khan younis .
witnesses said at least two missiles hit the car .
hospital officials said two other passengers were severely wounded .
after the strike , about 500 palestinians carried hamdan 's body through khan younis with gunmen firing their rifles in the air amid calls for revenge .
controversial policy thursday 's helicopter gunship attack appears to be in line with israel 's recent policy of targeting militants it says are planning or involved in attacks on israelis .
it followed a shooting spree on tuesday by a palestinian gunman who killed two israeli women in jerusalem 's city centre .
the israelis say hamdan had been involved in the recent killing of four israeli soldiers at an army post in gaza and was planning more attacks .
the army said he had been arrested briefly by palestinian police but was then released .
three other palestinians were killed earlier on thursday - two in what appeared to be a botched suicide mission in gaza and another in a clash with israeli soldiers in the west bank town of ramallah .
palestinian leaders have appealed for international intervention , saying they can not enforce a ceasefire while west bank towns remain under siege and israel continues to kill suspected militants .
but white house spokesman ari fleischer said president bush understood why israel " has taken the action that it takes , and it is up to chairman arafat to demonstrate the leadership to combat terrorism " .
and mr bush has now invited mr sharon to meet in washington on 7 february .
it will be mr sharon 's second visit to the united states in just over two months , whereas mr arafat has not yet met the us president since he took office a year ago .

we are now in a much stronger position to ... restore profitability in 2002 kurt hellstrom , ericsson the firm made a net loss of 21bn kronor -lrb- £ 1.4bn ; $ 2bn -rrb- in 2001 , as sales of mobile phones slumped towards the end of the year .
in 2000 , the firm made a profit of a roughly equivalent amount .
all mobile phone firms , whether manufacturers , operators or other technology providers , have suffered in recent months from a steep decline in demand for new handsets and subscriptions .
but analysts were cheered that ericsson had not lost market share , despite the perception that it is struggling to compete with larger finnish rival nokia .
some had expected a far worse financial performance from ericsson , especially since weak results from motorola on wednesday .
3g hopes although sales of existing network handsets declined by 7 % quarter on quarter in the last three months of the year , the company trumpeted strong growth in orders from third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- network providers .
shortage of handsets is seen as one of the key obstacles to the roll-out of 3g networks , which allow users a wider range of multimedia functions .
ericsson now claims a 60 % share in all 3g orders , which will accelerate as more operators start to prepare their networks .
" we have made significant progress in the changing handset market , where we have repositioned ericsson as one of the few that can deliver core handset technology , " said president and chief executive kurt hellstrom .
" we are now in a much stronger position to capitalise on market opportunities and restore profitability in 2002 . "
industry analyst peter richardson told the bbc 's world business report : " the first half of this year is probably going to stay pretty tough but moving into the second half what ericsson will be seeing there is the beginnings of revenue coming in from the third generation networks they are building now ... they do n't actually get revenues from them until the networks go live . "
market optimism ericsson said that the end-2001 fall in mobile sales was a temporary phenomenon .
by the end of 2001 , the number of mobile subscribers worldwide had grown to up to 950 million , the company said .
" we expect about 200 million new subscribers to be added in 2002 , a solid growth rate of 20-25 % , " the company said .
" our long-term forecast of 1.6 billion mobile subscribers by the end of 2005 remains unchanged . "
slashing spending part of the reason for the firm 's confidence is the fact that it has slimmed down radically in recent years .

we are now in a much stronger position to ... restore profitability in 2002 kurt hellstrom , ericsson the firm made a net loss of 21bn kronor -lrb- £ 1.4bn ; $ 2bn -rrb- in 2001 , as sales of mobile phones slumped towards the end of the year .
in 2000 , the firm made a profit of a roughly equivalent amount .
all mobile phone firms , whether manufacturers , operators or other technology providers , have suffered in recent months from a steep decline in demand for new handsets and subscriptions .
but analysts were cheered that ericsson had not lost market share , despite the perception that it is struggling to compete with larger finnish rival nokia .
some had expected a far worse financial performance from ericsson , especially since weak results from motorola on wednesday .
3g hopes although sales of existing network handsets declined by 7 % quarter on quarter in the last three months of the year , the company trumpeted strong growth in orders from third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- network providers .
ceo kurt hellstrom remains bullish shortage of handsets is seen as one of the key obstacles to the roll-out of 3g networks , which allow users a wider range of multimedia functions .
ericsson now claims a 60 % share in all 3g orders , which will accelerate as more operators start to prepare their networks .
" we have made significant progress in the changing handset market , where we have repositioned ericsson as one of the few that can deliver core handset technology , " said president and chief executive kurt hellstrom .
" we are now in a much stronger position to capitalise on market opportunities and restore profitability in 2002 . "
industry analyst peter richardson told the bbc 's world business report : " the first half of this year is probably going to stay pretty tough but moving into the second half what ericsson will be seeing there is the beginnings of revenue coming in from the third generation networks they are building now ... they do n't actually get revenues from them until the networks go live . "
market optimism ericsson said that the end-2001 fall in mobile sales was a temporary phenomenon .
by the end of 2001 , the number of mobile subscribers worldwide had grown to up to 950 million , the company said .
" we expect about 200 million new subscribers to be added in 2002 , a solid growth rate of 20-25 % , " the company said .
" our long-term forecast of 1.6 billion mobile subscribers by the end of 2005 remains unchanged . "
slashing spending part of the reason for the firm 's confidence is the fact that it has slimmed down radically in recent years .
mr hellstrom trumpeted the success of the company 's efficiency programme , a long-term cost-cutting scheme .

a team of researchers in bangor has discovered that tiny ice creatures in antarctica can survive at far lower temperatures than was ever thought possible .
they are hoping to use the organismsin washing powder to clean clothes at lower temperatures .
and as well as washing clothes whiter than white , the microscopic organisms could also hold the key to finding life on other planets .
sea ice covers more than 13 % of the earth 's surface when at its maximum extent .
instead of being a lifeless white desert , the pack ice is home to a host of tiny plants and animals that can thrive in numbers so large they can colour the ice brown by their presence .
a new breed of ' astro-biologists ' look to these frozen seas for clues about the lifeforms which could exist on frozen planets .
if such creatures are able to adapt to life at -20 celsius on earth , a question is raised about whether the same adaptations might work in the far colder , far thicker frozen surfaces of jupiter 's moons - europa and ganymede - and even on mars earlier on .
such work would also cast light on the earth 's own ' snowball ' period , when it was thought to be covered in ice scores of metres deep .
dr david thomas of the university of wales bangor 's school of ocean science is currently the only scientist in the uk working on the biology of the ice dwellers .
he has discovered many of the sea-ice organisms have enzymes specially adapted to work at high salt concentrations combined with low temepratures .
as a result , a host of antifreeze compounds are produced .
he said : " once isolated , the enzymes which protect organisms from the effects of cold could also have applications for a host of industries ranging from cleaning agents to food processing . "
dr thomas has conducted most of his research in antarctic waters where he has spent more than a year studying deep-freeze lifeforms .
on 27 january , he and colleague andreas krell will journey to a remote field station on the arctic coast of russia to conduct scientific studies on the sea ice in the white sea .
normally sea-ice scientists work from ice-breaking research ships to collect their samples .
this time they will be driving to a field station and conduct their work from the shore .

mr chavz announced that the new interior minister would be former navy captain ramon rodriguez .
he appointed a radical left-winger , former vice president adina bastidas , to the post of trade minister .
there is a division between radicals and moderates and the president appears to have sided with the radicals , where he feels more at home luis vicente leon pollster the reshuffle appears to be a defiant response to a massive street protest this week against the autocratic style of leadership of the ex-paratrooper .
venezuela 's roman catholic leaders have also spoken out against the president , rejecting recent criticisms he made of its role .
during wednesday 's march by an estimated 80,000 people through the capital , caracas , protesters called on the president either to moderate his policies or resign .
but the resignation of mr miquilena appears to have radicalized mr chavez 's left-wing government even further .
as the bbc 's adam easton reports from caracas , rumours had been circulating for weeks that the minister planned to resign over the president 's unwillingness to negotiate with the country 's business sector .
mr chavez said he accepted mr miquilena 's departure with regret : " i will never say good-bye to miquilena .
he will always be in my heart . "
the appointment of ms bastidas to the post of trade minister is being seen as a move towards radicalising the government .
the former vice president made headlines shortly after the 11 september terror attacks on the united states by linking terrorism to the dominance of anglo-saxon protestants in the world .
the country 's largest business association said her appointment was not a good signal to business .
mounting opposition the resignation of mr miquilena could damage the government , as the 83-year-old former prime minister holds great sway in mr chavez 's party , the fifth republic movement -lrb- mvr -rrb- , and could upset its parliamentary majority .
one pollster , luis vicente leon of datanalisis , said mr miquilena 's departure left " other moderates in the government without support " .
" there is a division between radicals and moderates in the mvr , and the president appears to have sided with the radicals , where he feels more at home , " he said .
mr chavez also now faces open opposition from the church in this predominantly roman catholic country .
the president recently compared the church to a tumour , saying it opposed his reforms without helping the country 's poor .
the head of the church in venezuela , bishop baltazar porras , said the comments showed mr chavez 's intransigence .
after three years in power , the president 's popularity has halved to just around 40 % .
wednesday 's demonstrations were the largest since he came to power .
