hde managing director holger wenzel told german radio on monday that it was " the worst year since the war . "

in 2001 viruses such as code red and nimda prompted warnings of internet meltdown and made many local parts of the net unusable for people connected via those links .
the last 12 months may not have had as many headline grabbing viruses , but many of the novel malicious programs debuting in 2002 had significant staying power and rattled around the web for months .
experts say the year has also shown some worrying trends and emphasised the importance of keeping anti-virus software up to date .
worm warning the biggest virus of 2002 was the windows klez worm which first appeared in march .
according to figures from anti-virus firm sophos , the virus accounted for almost a quarter of all the virus reports the company received in 2002 . "
we are going to see more convictions of virus writers " graham cluley , sophos virus catching firm messagelabs said it captured more than 10 million viruses throughout 2002 , and almost five million of those were copies of the klez worm .
the self-spreading worm travels by finding e-mail addresses it finds in windows outlook , instant messaging programs or in files on the infected machine .
klez has been so prolific because it contains its own e-mail engine and the subject line of any infected e-mail is regularly and randomly changed making it hard to warn people about it .
it can also be hard to warn people that they are infected because the virus fakes the address it came from .
threat analysis graham cluley , senior technology consultant at anti-virus firm sophos , said klez was a good example of the type of program popular with virus writers .
most active viruses in 2002 w32 / klez.h-mm w32 / yaha.e-mm w32 / bugbear.a-mm w95 / klez.e-mm w32 / sircam.a-mm w32 / magistr.a-mm w32 / badtrans.b-mm w32 / badtrans.b-mm w32 / hybris.gen-mm eml / greeting-card previously virus writers had favoured so-called script virus such as the love bug .
by contrast is a windows 32 executable file .
almost 90 % of virus reports in 2002 were about such programs .
ironically , said mr cluley , such viruses are easy to stop with a properly configured e-mail gateway .
this year saw virus writers continuing to use the names of popular woman celebrities to try to make people open an e-mail and unleash its malicious payload .
colombian popstar shakira , singer britney spears and actress jennifer lopez have all been used to name viruses .
spam attack the last year also showed a significant rise in the numbers of viruses in circulation as well as the appearance of several hundred new viruses .
there are now more than 78,000 known viruses in existence .
when message labs started scanning e-mail for viruses it was catching one virus every 60 minutes .
in 2001 this leapt to one every 30 seconds .
in 2002 the rate hit one every three seconds .
one worrying trend was the emergence of marketing companies that use virus techniques to spread their message .
one of the first to use this technique is panamanian company permissioned media which buries the agreement to let it plunder e-mail address books in the small print of its license agreement .
but , said mr cluley , despite these increases there were some encouraging signs for those fighting the spread of these malicious programs .
david l smith , the writer of the melissa virus , was finally sentenced and 2002 saw the capture trial and charging of several other virus writers .
this is a trend that mr cluley expected to see continue in 2003 .
" i 'm positive we are going to see more convictions of virus writers , " he said .
" we need to get away from the idea that these guys are geniuses , " he said , " that is really the wrong message to send to these kids . "
" viruses have real victims , its not just faceless corporations , " he said .

in 2001 viruses such as code red and nimda prompted warnings of internet meltdown and made many local parts of the net unusable for people connected via those links .
the last 12 months may not have had as many headline grabbing viruses , but many of the novel malicious programs debuting in 2002 had significant staying power and rattled around the web for months .
experts say the year has also shown some worrying trends and emphasised the importance of keeping anti-virus software up to date .
worm warning the biggest virus of 2002 was the windows klez worm which first appeared in march .
according to figures from anti-virus firm sophos , the virus accounted for almost a quarter of all the virus reports the company received in 2002 .
we are going to see more convictions of virus writers graham cluley , sophos virus catching firm messagelabs said it captured more than 10 million viruses throughout 2002 , and almost five million of those were copies of the klez worm .
the self-spreading worm travels by finding e-mail addresses it finds in windows outlook , instant messaging programs or in files on the infected machine .
klez has been so prolific because it contains its own e-mail engine and the subject line of any infected e-mail is regularly and randomly changed making it hard to warn people about it .
it can also be hard to warn people that they are infected because the virus fakes the address it came from .
threat analysis graham cluley , senior technology consultant at anti-virus firm sophos , said klez was a good example of the type of program popular with virus writers .
most active viruses in 2002 w32 / klez.h-mm w32 / yaha.e-mm w32 / bugbear.a-mm w95 / klez.e-mm w32 / sircam.a-mm w32 / magistr.a-mm w32 / badtrans.b-mm w32 / badtrans.b-mm w32 / hybris.gen-mm eml / greeting-card previously virus writers had favoured so-called script virus such as the love bug .
by contrast is a windows 32 executable file .
almost 90 % of virus reports in 2002 were about such programs .
ironically , said mr cluley , such viruses are easy to stop with a properly configured e-mail gateway .
this year saw virus writers continuing to use the names of popular woman celebrities to try to make people open an e-mail and unleash its malicious payload .
colombian popstar shakira , singer britney spears and actress jennifer lopez have all been used to name viruses .
spam attack the last year also showed a significant rise in the numbers of viruses in circulation as well as the appearance of several hundred new viruses .
there are now more than 78,000 known viruses in existence .
when message labs started scanning e-mail for viruses it was catching one virus every 60 minutes .
in 2001 this leapt to one every 30 seconds .
in 2002 the rate hit one every three seconds .
one worrying trend was the emergence of marketing companies that use virus techniques to spread their message .
2002 lacked a headline hitting virus one of the first to use this technique is panamanian company permissioned media which buries the agreement to let it plunder e-mail address books in the small print of its license agreement .
but , said mr cluley , despite these increases there were some encouraging signs for those fighting the spread of these malicious programs .
david l smith , the writer of the melissa virus , was finally sentenced and 2002 saw the capture trial and charging of several other virus writers .
this is a trend that mr cluley expected to see continue in 2003 .
" i 'm positive we are going to see more convictions of virus writers , " he said .
" we need to get away from the idea that these guys are geniuses , " he said , " that is really the wrong message to send to these kids . "
" viruses have real victims , its not just faceless corporations , " he said .

the bbc is hoping to explode a few myths about sherlock holmes with a feature-length version of the hound of the baskervilles .
one of the most common myths , that sherlock holmes wore a deerstalker hat and enjoyed a pipe , is a film addition .
the story-telling is so extraordinary and the detail so brilliant richard roxburgh actor basil rathbone adopted these props for his legendary 1939 portrayal of the baker street detective , but they were not based on the facts as presented by the author , sir arthur conan doyle .
australian actor richard roxburgh , who starred as the evil duke in moulin rouge , plays the fictional sleuth as viewers have never seen him .
he smokes cigarettes , wears a square bowler hat and - as depicted by conan doyle - has a drug addiction .
' perspective ' holmes is shown injecting drugs into his arm in scenes bound to upset the squeamish .
" i guess my perspective is that conan doyle talks about it , " says roxburgh .
watson was not the bumbling fool so often depicted " holmes was addicted to cocaine and took a 7 % solution twice a day , then he had to take morphine to relax . "
" the fact that it is graphic may be an issue for some people , but to my mind it 's being truthful to the character , because then you have to ask why he does that . "
initially , roxburgh says he had reservations about playing the quintessential englishman : " i ca n't do that - i 'm from albury wodonga in australia .
but , when you get on top of that , you think he 's just another character . "
he says he found a wealth of inspiration in conan doyle 's stories .
" i love the little details - like the place in baker street being a pigsty and how they used to find cigarette butts in tea cups .
we tried to get a sense of that . "
ian hart , who appeared as quirrell in harry potter and the philosopher 's stone , co-stars as a dr watson considerably removed from the slow-witted character of other adaptations .
' lovely relationship ' " in conan doyle , he 's a doctor of medicine .
he 's a very intelligent man .
he 's hanging off holmes ' coat-tails sometimes , but he 's not a fool , " says roxburgh .
" it was a lovely relationship to explore and try to bring to life . "
it was the only sherlock holmes story i had read richard roxburgh in one of the film 's enduring images , watson battles to save holmes from being drowned in a bog .
the scene involved roxburgh spending three-quarters of a day up to his ears in muck .
" as far as i could establish , it was a bog , " he jokes .
" it smelt like bog , it acted like bog and it had the suction capacity of bog .
i do n't know where they got it from , but it was pretty genuine . "
the hound of the baskervilles , centring on an aristocratic family tormented by the legend of a moor-dwelling beast which is baying for their blood , is one of conan doyle 's most famous stories .
" it was the only sherlock holmes story i had read before i was asked to do it , " says roxburgh .
" then i read the whole canon , which was a great revelation .
i thought it was going to be quaint , but the story-telling is so extraordinary and the detail so brilliant .
i loved it . "
tennis ball the supporting cast boasts john nettles , richard e grant and liza tarbuck .
basil rathbone introduced the famous hat and pipe the hound itself , a mix of doberman , rhodesian ridgeback and hyena , was created with computer-generated animation .
" we had to look at a tennis ball on a stick , " said roxburgh of filming the scenes where the hound would eventually feature .
" people make a lot of the bizarre-ness of cgi -lrb- computer-generated imagery -rrb- but it 's no more bizarre than a lot of things you have to do on film . "

the bbc is hoping to explode a few myths about sherlock holmes with a feature-length version of the hound of the baskervilles .
one of the most common myths , that sherlock holmes wore a deerstalker hat and enjoyed a pipe , is a film addition . "
the story-telling is so extraordinary and the detail so brilliant " richard roxburgh actor basil rathbone adopted these props for his legendary 1939 portrayal of the baker street detective , but they were not based on the facts as presented by the author , sir arthur conan doyle .
australian actor richard roxburgh , who starred as the evil duke in moulin rouge , plays the fictional sleuth as viewers have never seen him .
he smokes cigarettes , wears a square bowler hat and - as depicted by conan doyle - has a drug addiction .
' perspective ' holmes is shown injecting drugs into his arm in scenes bound to upset the squeamish .
" i guess my perspective is that conan doyle talks about it , " says roxburgh .
" holmes was addicted to cocaine and took a 7 % solution twice a day , then he had to take morphine to relax . "
" the fact that it is graphic may be an issue for some people , but to my mind it 's being truthful to the character , because then you have to ask why he does that . "
initially , roxburgh says he had reservations about playing the quintessential englishman : " i ca n't do that - i 'm from albury wodonga in australia .
but , when you get on top of that , you think he 's just another character . "
he says he found a wealth of inspiration in conan doyle 's stories .
" i love the little details - like the place in baker street being a pigsty and how they used to find cigarette butts in tea cups .
we tried to get a sense of that . "
ian hart , who appeared as quirrell in harry potter and the philosopher 's stone , co-stars as a dr watson considerably removed from the slow-witted character of other adaptations .
' lovely relationship ' " in conan doyle , he 's a doctor of medicine .
he 's a very intelligent man .
he 's hanging off holmes ' coat-tails sometimes , but he 's not a fool , " says roxburgh .
" it was a lovely relationship to explore and try to bring to life . "
" it was the only sherlock holmes story i had read " richard roxburgh in one of the film 's enduring images , watson battles to save holmes from being drowned in a bog .
the scene involved roxburgh spending three-quarters of a day up to his ears in muck .
" as far as i could establish , it was a bog , " he jokes .
" it smelt like bog , it acted like bog and it had the suction capacity of bog .
i do n't know where they got it from , but it was pretty genuine . "
the hound of the baskervilles , centring on an aristocratic family tormented by the legend of a moor-dwelling beast which is baying for their blood , is one of conan doyle 's most famous stories .
" it was the only sherlock holmes story i had read before i was asked to do it , " says roxburgh .
" then i read the whole canon , which was a great revelation .
i thought it was going to be quaint , but the story-telling is so extraordinary and the detail so brilliant .
i loved it . "
tennis ball the supporting cast boasts john nettles , richard e grant and liza tarbuck .
the hound itself , a mix of doberman , rhodesian ridgeback and hyena , was created with computer-generated animation .
" we had to look at a tennis ball on a stick , " said roxburgh of filming the scenes where the hound would eventually feature .
" people make a lot of the bizarre-ness of cgi -lrb- computer-generated imagery -rrb- but it 's no more bizarre than a lot of things you have to do on film . "
it seems roxburgh has developed a taste for playing legendary fictional characters .
in the new year , he will play dracula in gothic action film van helsing , also starring hugh jackman and kate beckinsale .
" it 's a great challenge to take a role that people believe they know or have an understanding of , " he said .
" it 's going back to the writings about the character .
it 's a great psychology . "
the hound of the baskervilles is shown on bbc one on boxing day at 2100 gmt .

fife constabulary has launched two major new initiatives aimed at turning round " bitterly disappointing " statistics in the region .
the figures indicated that more than 60 % of the 17-to-25-year-old age group intend to drink and drive over the festive season .
the amount of young people in particular prepared to drink and drive has increased quite dramatically derrick scougal assistant chief constable the group already accounts for 36 % of the drivers in fife who are detected .
the force has now created a form on its website where motorists under the influence of drink or drugs can be anonymously reported .
assistant chief constable derrick scougal said : " it has become all too apparent in recent times that the amount of young people in particular prepared to drink and drive has increased quite dramatically .
" but what we find perhaps most disturbing is that 64 % of the 17-to-25 age group actually stated that they had intended to get drunk and still drive , compared to 23 % in all the other age groups .
" that is why we have taken the step of introducing a special page on the fife constabulary website - www.fife.police.uk - through which drink driving offenders can be reported . "
offenders can be anonymously reported online the force is backing up the drink-driving message with a giant advertising trailer on the north end of the forth road bridge .
its message reminds motorists of the consequences if they choose to drink and drive .
the ad-trailer reads : " off to your office night out ?
see you when you get back . fife constabulary . "
officers are also carrying out work with 5th and 6th year pupils in all fife secondary schools in an effort to target the drivers of the future .

the bloody sunday inquiry entered a new and potentially crucial phase when it moved to london in september to start hearing evidence from soldiers , senior politicians and civil servants .
it 's investigating the shooting dead of 13 men by the british army during a civil rights march in londonderry in january 1972 .
the tribunal has moved to london because a number of soldiers successfully argued , right up to the court of appeal , that their lives would be more at risk if they had to travel to the guildhall in derry to testify .
the evidence is currently being heard at methodist central hall a couple of hundred yards from downing street where the prime minister in 1972 , sir edward heath , discussed the plans for the civil rights march a couple of days before bloody sunday .
sir edward heath : the inquiry hopes to hear his evidence in the new year a unique moment in british legal history was missed when sir edward , aged 86 , fell a few days before he was due to enter the witness box and was unable to testify .
the inquiry hopes to hear his evidence in the new year .
arrangements for the evidence of a number of former ruc witnesses were also debated in the court of appeal .
disruption was caused to the inquiry 's schedule at the start of the year when a number of former and serving police officers told the tribunal , shortly before they were due to testify , that they wanted to do so from behind screens in order to protect their identities .
they won the case in the court of appeal and while they were named as they gave their evidence to the tribunal , they were only seen by the judges and the legal teams .
in november , the soldier in charge of the army 's operation on bloody sunday told the inquiry that the parachute regiment had disobeyed his orders by driving deep into the bogside in a number of armoured cars .
however , brigadier pat maclellan said that he had left most of the details of the army operation to the officer commanding the first battalion the parachute regiment , lieutenant colonel derek wilford , who is expected to testify some time in 2003 .
evidence before the inquiry left derry to move to westminster , forensic science and ballistics experts appointed by the saville inquiry delivered their reports after re-examining the forensic evidence from 1972 .
dr john lloyd said that evidence , which helped lord widgery to find that some of those killed had been firing or handling guns , was worthless .
he also said that , if anything , the evidence indicated that those killed were not gunmen .
other medical and ballistics experts said the most likely explanation for one of the gunshot wounds to one of the victims , jim wray , was that he was lying on the ground when he was shot .
also expected in 2003 is that the inquiry will hear the evidence of some of the soldiers who fired live rounds and therefore killed people on bloody sunday .
the majority of them will tell the tribunal that they only fired at identified gunmen and bombers .
this evidence will be vigorously challenged by the legal teams representing the families of those killed .
the tribunal has so far cost about £ 100m and the cost could rise to £ 150m as the tribunal is not expected to finish until some time in 2004 .

the evidence is currently being heard at methodist central hall a couple of hundred yards from downing street where the prime minister in 1972 , sir edward heath , discussed the plans for the civil rights march a couple of days before bloody sunday .
a unique moment in british legal history was missed when sir edward , aged 86 , fell a few days before he was due to enter the witness box and was unable to testify .
the inquiry hopes to hear his evidence in the new year .
arrangements for the evidence of a number of former ruc witnesses were also debated in the court of appeal .
disruption was caused to the inquiry 's schedule at the start of the year when a number of former and serving police officers told the tribunal , shortly before they were due to testify , that they wanted to do so from behind screens in order to protect their identities .
they won the case in the court of appeal and while they were named as they gave their evidence to the tribunal , they were only seen by the judges and the legal teams .
in november , the soldier in charge of the army 's operation on bloody sunday told the inquiry that the parachute regiment had disobeyed his orders by driving deep into the bogside in a number of armoured cars .
however , brigadier pat maclellan said that he had left most of the details of the army operation to the officer commanding the first battalion the parachute regiment , lieutenant colonel derek wilford , who is expected to testify some time in 2003 .
evidence before the inquiry left derry to move to westminster , forensic science and ballistics experts appointed by the saville inquiry delivered their reports after re-examining the forensic evidence from 1972 .
dr john lloyd said that evidence , which helped lord widgery to find that some of those killed had been firing or handling guns , was worthless .
he also said that , if anything , the evidence indicated that those killed were not gunmen .
other medical and ballistics experts said the most likely explanation for one of the gunshot wounds to one of the victims , jim wray , was that he was lying on the ground when he was shot .
also expected in 2003 is that the inquiry will hear the evidence of some of the soldiers who fired live rounds and therefore killed people on bloody sunday .
the majority of them will tell the tribunal that they only fired at identified gunmen and bombers .
this evidence will be vigorously challenged by the legal teams representing the families of those killed .
the tribunal has so far cost about £ 100m and the cost could rise to £ 150m as the tribunal is not expected to finish until some time in 2004 .
