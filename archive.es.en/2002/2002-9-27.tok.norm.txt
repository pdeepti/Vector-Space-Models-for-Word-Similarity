tougher action against paedophilic priests the bishops also decided to pursue a more intensive examination of accusations of sexual abuse in the church in the future .
this would involve appointing an external ombudsman in every diocese who would serve as a contact person for victims of sexual abuse as well as suspicious priests .

he stands accused of the " gravest human rights violations " since wwii . slobodan milosevic faces the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia on friday in what is expected to be the weightiest part of his war crimes trial .
in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .
he has done it while at the same time refusing to recognize the tribunal as a legitimate judicial institution .
observers say the pressure is on the prosecution to do a better job of linking milosevic to atrocities with concrete evidence , something critics say un chief prosecutor carla del ponte failed to do during the first phase of the trial that ended four weeks ago .
" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .
he said each witness will shed " differing shafts of light " on milosevic 's responsibility for numerous crimes , including the massacre at the town of srebrenica that claimed 10,000 lives and the 46-week period where bosnian serbs laid siege to the city of sarajevo . he said the yugoslav army paid the bosnian serbs responsible for the siege of sarajevo even as milosevic publicly condemned it .
prosecutors also said serbian interior ministry police were involved in ethnic cleansing at srebrenica .
the attacks were part of a grander serb plan to carve out an ethnically-pure serbian state , said prosecutors , of which milosevic was involved .
" the systematic and organized way in which attacks against non-serb civilian populations in croatia were carried out revealed a carefully deisgned scheme and strategy within an overall plan that may be laid at the door of the accused , " nice said in opening statements .
cooperation still " fractious " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 2000 file photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .

-lrb- ap photo / str / files -rrb- chief prosecutor del ponte gave a few short remarks at the beginning of thursday 's proceedings , lamenting yugoslavia 's " fractious " cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in ththe hague .
she urged the current yugoslavian government to send more of milosevic 's aides to testify .
bosnian protestors outside of the trial demanded renewed efforts to capture war criminals radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , who have so far eluded the grasp of nato troops in the balkans .
around 177 witnesses will be called by the prosecution in this phase of the trial , including prominents like croatian president stjepan mesic and usa top diplomat and un ambassador richard holbrooke . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic launches vigorous defence accused of genocide and war crimes , the former yugoslav president ridicules the un court as his lawless captor and launches a robust defence , aided by gory photographs of civilians killed by nato bombs .

at the conclusion of the meeting on thursday , the 68 bishops from dioceses all over the country came together under the chairmanship of cardinal lehmann and admitted for the first time to " often reacting inappropriately " in previous cases of sexual abuse in the church .

paedophilia a sticky issue with church authorities but despite the wide-sweeping measures , the question of paedophilia still sits uneasily with the german catholic church as comments by cardinal lehmann in fulda showed .
on friday cardinal lehmann said that priests under suspicion of wrongdoing face intense public pressure to confess their deeds .

rival candidates vojislav kostunica and miroljub labus are expected to run head-to-head in second-round voting in two weeks time . the serbian people go to the polls this sunday to elect a new president .
opinion polls predict that current yugoslav president vojislav kostunica and yugoslav deputy prime minister miroljub labus will be the top two vote-getters in this first-round voting .
kostunica is expected to win in the second head-to-head runoff to be held two weeks later . the result of the election will have far-reaching consequences for continued economic and geo-political reforms taking place in serbia .
the current yugoslav federation , of which serbia is a part , is set to metamorphasise into a looser union , specified simply as montenegro and serbia . the post of serbian president will provide kostunica – whose opponents describe as the respectable face of hardline serbian nationalists – with the best chance of hanging on to power in the balkan region .
serbia is the largest state in the former yugoslavia . power struggle observers in the former yugloslavian state fear that victory for kostunica will result in an internal power stuggle between the serbian prime minister and the serbian president .
serbian prime minister zoran djindjic is backing labus . labus is a pro-market liberal and has been praised by western officials for introducing free-market reforms -lrb- together with djindjic -rrb- in serbia . kostunica - a 58-year-old law professor of the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- - describes himself as a moderate nationalist and argues that these reforms have been carried out badly and could cause future problems for the serbian economy . kostunica has said that establishing the democratic rule of law will be his top priority if he wins on sunday .
he also wants to oversee the creation of a new constitution and other laws to replace legislation dating from the authoritarian rule of slobodon milosevic .
“ mr. labus is fond of saying the economy is above everything .
for me , law is above everything … those are very serious and very principled differences between us , ” he told reuters news agency in an interview earlier this week .
kostunica has also fiercely criticised the u.n. war crimes tribunal , where milosevic is currently on trial .
kostunica accuses the tribunal of having an anti-serb bias .

at the conclusion of the meeting on thursday , the 68 bishops from dioceses all over the country came together under the chairmanship of cardinal lehmann and admitted for the first time to " often reacting inappropriately " in previous cases of sexual abuse in the church .
tougher action against paedophilic priests the bishops also decided to pursue a more intensive examination of accusations of sexual abuse in the church in the future .
this would involve appointing an external ombudsman in every diocese who would serve as a contact person for victims of sexual abuse as well as suspicious priests .
until now , each of germany ’ s 27 dioceses had its own method of dealing with the problem , which most often involved immediately suspending the priests and then transferring them out of their parishes .
in addition , the clerics also decided to initiate an internal inquiry in paedophilic cases before the criminal prosecution authorities intervened .
only once sexual abuse of children and youth were proved , would the guilty priest be advised to give himself up to police officials .
victims of sexual abuse will also be offered humanitarian , therapeutic and pastoral help in the future , and it will be mandatory for paedophilic priests to undergo therapy henceforth .
the bishops also did not rule out defrocking a guilty priest in certain serious cases .
paedophilia a sticky issue with church authorities but despite the wide-sweeping measures , the question of paedophilia still sits uneasily with the german catholic church as comments by cardinal lehmann in fulda showed .
on friday cardinal lehmann said that priests under suspicion of wrongdoing face intense public pressure to confess their deeds .
at the same time he said that hurling accusations of sexual abuse at priests had almost become common-place and an excuse to hit at priests .
he said the church reckoned with unending complaints against clerics in dioceses where they weren ’ t popular .
" suspicions are quickly formed , if one wants to get at a priest , " lehmann said .
these people -lrb- the priests -rrb- are then " destroyed " for life , he concluded .
another grey area for the catholic church in germany is the fact that the vatican in rome will have the final say in each case of sexual abuse .
according to the new resolutions , each serious case has to be referred to the vatican especially if suspicions against a priest are proved true .
lehmann made it clear that he expected dealing with directives from distant rome to be problematic .
" how that is actually going to work in reality is still not clear to me , " he said .
german catholic church hit by scandals following the paedophilia scandal in the united states involving more than a hundred priests last spring , the catholic church in germany too has come under intense pressure after it was hit by a string of scandals in recent months .
numerous cases of paedophilia concerning catholic priests have surfaced , including in cardinal lehmann ’ s own diocese in mainz .

paedophilia a sticky issue with church authorities but despite the wide-sweeping measures , the question of paedophilia still sits uneasily with the german catholic church as comments by cardinal lehmann in fulda showed .
on friday cardinal lehmann said that priests under suspicion of wrongdoing face intense public pressure to confess their deeds .
at the same time he said that hurling accusations of sexual abuse at priests had almost become common-place and an excuse to hit at priests .
he said the church reckoned with unending complaints against clerics in dioceses where they weren ’ t popular .
" suspicions are quickly formed , if one wants to get at a priest , " lehmann said .
these people -lrb- the priests -rrb- are then " destroyed " for life , he concluded .
another grey area for the catholic church in germany is the fact that the vatican in rome will have the final say in each case of sexual abuse .
according to the new resolutions , each serious case has to be referred to the vatican especially if suspicions against a priest are proved true .
lehmann made it clear that he expected dealing with directives from distant rome to be problematic .
" how that is actually going to work in reality is still not clear to me , " he said .
german catholic church hit by scandals following the paedophilia scandal in the united states involving more than a hundred priests last spring , the catholic church in germany too has come under intense pressure after it was hit by a string of scandals in recent months .
numerous cases of paedophilia concerning catholic priests have surfaced , including in cardinal lehmann ’ s own diocese in mainz .
the revelations have caused " massive damage " to the church , said lehmann during the opening of the conference .
church under fire for passive aid to nazis the four-day bishops conference this week has not just been under pressure to do more against paedophilic priests , but has also been grappling with allegations of providing passive aid to the nazis under hitler ’ s dictatorship .
in an interview with the german magazine stern this week , american author daniel goldhagen of the book hitler ’ s willing executioners , said the catholic church " actively and willingly helped to push the race law by protecting access to lineage documents in the church archive , " during hitler ’ s reign .
goldhagen gave the interview in advance of his new book the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair .
" the church and clergy in all of europe undisputedly carried out and supported crimes against jews , " goldhagen says in the interview .
germany ’ s cardinal karl lehmann rejected the accusations , saying the church helped protect 80 percent of the 900,000 jews that survived the holocaust .
he did regret that pope pius xii didn ’ t openly oppose the holocaust and admitted that an anti-semitic groundswell was still present in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's catholic church ambivalent about pedophilia priestly pedophilia isn ’ t a uniquely american phenomenon .

in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .

rival candidates vojislav kostunica and miroljub labus are expected to run head-to-head in second-round voting in two weeks time . the serbian people go to the polls this sunday to elect a new president .
opinion polls predict that current yugoslav president vojislav kostunica and yugoslav deputy prime minister miroljub labus will be the top two vote-getters in this first-round voting .
kostunica is expected to win in the second head-to-head runoff to be held two weeks later . the result of the election will have far-reaching consequences for continued economic and geo-political reforms taking place in serbia .
the current yugoslav federation , of which serbia is a part , is set to metamorphasise into a looser union , specified simply as montenegro and serbia . the post of serbian president will provide kostunica – whose opponents describe as the respectable face of hardline serbian nationalists – with the best chance of hanging on to power in the balkan region .
serbia is the largest state in the former yugoslavia . power struggle observers in the former yugloslavian state fear that victory for kostunica will result in an internal power stuggle between the serbian prime minister and the serbian president .
serbian prime minister zoran djindjic is backing labus . labus is a pro-market liberal and has been praised by western officials for introducing free-market reforms -lrb- together with djindjic -rrb- in serbia . kostunica - a 58-year-old law professor of the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- - describes himself as a moderate nationalist and argues that these reforms have been carried out badly and could cause future problems for the serbian economy . kostunica has said that establishing the democratic rule of law will be his top priority if he wins on sunday .
he also wants to oversee the creation of a new constitution and other laws to replace legislation dating from the authoritarian rule of slobodon milosevic .
“ mr. labus is fond of saying the economy is above everything .
for me , law is above everything … those are very serious and very principled differences between us , ” he told reuters news agency in an interview earlier this week .
kostunica has also fiercely criticised the u.n. war crimes tribunal , where milosevic is currently on trial .
kostunica accuses the tribunal of having an anti-serb bias .
he also caused outrage in ex-yugoslav bosnia when he declared at a campaign rally that serbia and bosnia were only “ temporarily separated ” .
the election campaign has been marred by growing racial tension in the state .
united nations police stopped ultra-nationalist leader vorjisla seselj from entering kosovo on thursday fearing his appearance at an election rally would stoke ethnic tensions .
un officials have discouraged serbian politicians from campaigning in the province , fearing outrage from the ethnic albanian majority who want complete independence for the region , placed under un control in 1999 .
the current serbian president , milan milutinovic , has already been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in the hague , and could be at risk of extradition once out of office at the end of the year . meanwhile on friday at the hague war crimes tribunal , milosevic faced the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia – the weightest section of the case against him . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid for serbia ?

at the conclusion of the meeting on thursday , the 68 bishops from dioceses all over the country came together under the chairmanship of cardinal lehmann and admitted for the first time to " often reacting inappropriately " in previous cases of sexual abuse in the church .
tougher action against paedophilic priests the bishops also decided to pursue a more intensive examination of accusations of sexual abuse in the church in the future .
this would involve appointing an external ombudsman in every diocese who would serve as a contact person for victims of sexual abuse as well as suspicious priests .
until now , each of germany ’ s 27 dioceses had its own method of dealing with the problem , which most often involved immediately suspending the priests and then transferring them out of their parishes .
in addition , the clerics also decided to initiate an internal inquiry in paedophilic cases before the criminal prosecution authorities intervened .
only once sexual abuse of children and youth were proved , would the guilty priest be advised to give himself up to police officials .
victims of sexual abuse will also be offered humanitarian , therapeutic and pastoral help in the future , and it will be mandatory for paedophilic priests to undergo therapy henceforth .
the bishops also did not rule out defrocking a guilty priest in certain serious cases .

he stands accused of the " gravest human rights violations " since wwii . slobodan milosevic faces the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia on friday in what is expected to be the weightiest part of his war crimes trial .
in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .
he has done it while at the same time refusing to recognize the tribunal as a legitimate judicial institution .
observers say the pressure is on the prosecution to do a better job of linking milosevic to atrocities with concrete evidence , something critics say un chief prosecutor carla del ponte failed to do during the first phase of the trial that ended four weeks ago .
" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .
he said each witness will shed " differing shafts of light " on milosevic 's responsibility for numerous crimes , including the massacre at the town of srebrenica that claimed 10,000 lives and the 46-week period where bosnian serbs laid siege to the city of sarajevo . he said the yugoslav army paid the bosnian serbs responsible for the siege of sarajevo even as milosevic publicly condemned it .
prosecutors also said serbian interior ministry police were involved in ethnic cleansing at srebrenica .
the attacks were part of a grander serb plan to carve out an ethnically-pure serbian state , said prosecutors , of which milosevic was involved .
" the systematic and organized way in which attacks against non-serb civilian populations in croatia were carried out revealed a carefully deisgned scheme and strategy within an overall plan that may be laid at the door of the accused , " nice said in opening statements .

bosnian protestors outside of the trial demanded renewed efforts to capture war criminals radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , who have so far eluded the grasp of nato troops in the balkans .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 a shift in belief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people are looking for the answers at church .
when the twin towers collapsed last sept .
11 , many people asked themselves how god could allow such a thing to happen .
but have the terrorist attacks changed people ’ s relationship to religion and belief ? it has been a year since the terror attacks of sept .
11 shocked the world .
in germany , tens of thousands of people expressed their sympathy with the united states and the victims of the attacks .
the wave of emotions appeared endless : shock , anger , despair and frustration were overwhelming .
memorial services were packed and many people hoped to find solace and comfort in the country ’ s churches .
prelate dr. heiner koch from the cologne archbishopric says the services in the city 's cathedral were much better attended in the days following sept .
11 than ever before .
" i also noticed that people ’ s sensitivity was higher in this time , " he told deutsche welle .
" i held the high mass on the sunday directly after the attacks , where i addressed what happened .
and i have never gotten so much response to a sermon as i did then . "
but , koch adds , this short-term reaction can not be mistaken for a fundamental change in germany ’ s religious landscape .
" i don ’ t believe that . "
searching for answers of course , it is difficult - if not impossible - to back up the impressions of prelate koch and other religious groups in germany with concrete figures .
after all , no one has sat at the church ’ s door over the past year , counting the faithful as they pour in .
but one fact that has materialized is an increased interest in islam .
herder verlag , germany ’ s leading publisher of religious and theological books , says its books on islamic belief and tradition became bestsellers overnight .
herder also noticed a rise in sales for other spiritual literature , including books on meditation .
it appears that many people were searching for meaning not so much in the church , as within themselves .
robert doetsch , or swami ramateertha , is head of the osho uta center for spiritual therapy and meditation in cologne , one of the largest spiritual centers in europe .
he confirms this development .
" after the initial shock subsided , people started becoming alive again .
and then the real questions arise , like why am i here , what do i really want ? "
he says he found these issues became more pressing after september 11th , and that the sharpness of the situation has continued .
" it has become more particular that the ones who are looking for a different way are doing so more strongly . "
but , he adds , people who are looking for answers in old values are also doing so more intently .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prayer prelate koch says he has noticed this tendency , too .
" i had the impression that people ’ s sense of security also collapsed with those towers .
the terror attacks made some things appear questionable .
and i believe that a lasting tendency is that people are questioning more now .
above all , i and many of my colleagues determined that people have become more open towards christian beliefs . "
" no world peace without a peace between religions . "
but the events of sept .
11 didn ’ t just lead to a shift in personal religious or spiritual activities .
as the increased interest in the koran and islamic literature showed , there was also a change in the way people viewed other religions .
annette esser heads the cologne / bonn branch of religions for peace , an inter-religious u.n. organization bringing together representatives of the world ’ s great religions .
she says it became important to many germans after the terror attacks to understand islam better and to improve inter-religious dialogue .
" the theologian hans küng said there will be no world peace without a peace between religions .
well , after sept .
11 , that saying became very urgent , " she says .
according to esser , a positive effect of sept .
11 has been the increased importance placed on inter-religious dialogue .
this exchange is crucial for the development of peace in the future , she says .
" really , religion is about peace , but it was misused for war .
and i think now , as it might be going to a war against iraq , we have more the feeling that we should enter into a dialogue with muslims worldwide , including iraq . "
for esser and many other theologians , religion could be an aid to develop dialogue in a peaceful way .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 a shift in belief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people are looking for the answers at church .
when the twin towers collapsed last sept .
11 , many people asked themselves how god could allow such a thing to happen .
but have the terrorist attacks changed people ’ s relationship to religion and belief ? it has been a year since the terror attacks of sept .
11 shocked the world .
in germany , tens of thousands of people expressed their sympathy with the united states and the victims of the attacks .
the wave of emotions appeared endless : shock , anger , despair and frustration were overwhelming .
memorial services were packed and many people hoped to find solace and comfort in the country ’ s churches .
prelate dr. heiner koch from the cologne archbishopric says the services in the city 's cathedral were much better attended in the days following sept .
11 than ever before .
" i also noticed that people ’ s sensitivity was higher in this time , " he told deutsche welle .
" i held the high mass on the sunday directly after the attacks , where i addressed what happened .
and i have never gotten so much response to a sermon as i did then . "
but , koch adds , this short-term reaction can not be mistaken for a fundamental change in germany ’ s religious landscape .
" i don ’ t believe that . "
searching for answers of course , it is difficult - if not impossible - to back up the impressions of prelate koch and other religious groups in germany with concrete figures .
after all , no one has sat at the church ’ s door over the past year , counting the faithful as they pour in .
but one fact that has materialized is an increased interest in islam .
herder verlag , germany ’ s leading publisher of religious and theological books , says its books on islamic belief and tradition became bestsellers overnight .
herder also noticed a rise in sales for other spiritual literature , including books on meditation .
it appears that many people were searching for meaning not so much in the church , as within themselves .
robert doetsch , or swami ramateertha , is head of the osho uta center for spiritual therapy and meditation in cologne , one of the largest spiritual centers in europe .
he confirms this development .
" after the initial shock subsided , people started becoming alive again .
and then the real questions arise , like why am i here , what do i really want ? "
he says he found these issues became more pressing after september 11th , and that the sharpness of the situation has continued .
" it has become more particular that the ones who are looking for a different way are doing so more strongly . "
but , he adds , people who are looking for answers in old values are also doing so more intently .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prayer prelate koch says he has noticed this tendency , too .
" i had the impression that people ’ s sense of security also collapsed with those towers .
the terror attacks made some things appear questionable .
and i believe that a lasting tendency is that people are questioning more now .
above all , i and many of my colleagues determined that people have become more open towards christian beliefs . "
" no world peace without a peace between religions . "
but the events of sept .
11 didn ’ t just lead to a shift in personal religious or spiritual activities .
as the increased interest in the koran and islamic literature showed , there was also a change in the way people viewed other religions .
annette esser heads the cologne / bonn branch of religions for peace , an inter-religious u.n. organization bringing together representatives of the world ’ s great religions .
she says it became important to many germans after the terror attacks to understand islam better and to improve inter-religious dialogue .
" the theologian hans küng said there will be no world peace without a peace between religions .
well , after sept .
11 , that saying became very urgent , " she says .
according to esser , a positive effect of sept .
11 has been the increased importance placed on inter-religious dialogue .
this exchange is crucial for the development of peace in the future , she says .
" really , religion is about peace , but it was misused for war .
and i think now , as it might be going to a war against iraq , we have more the feeling that we should enter into a dialogue with muslims worldwide , including iraq . "
for esser and many other theologians , religion could be an aid to develop dialogue in a peaceful way .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 a shift in belief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people are looking for the answers at church .
when the twin towers collapsed last sept .
11 , many people asked themselves how god could allow such a thing to happen .
but have the terrorist attacks changed people ’ s relationship to religion and belief ? it has been a year since the terror attacks of sept .
11 shocked the world .
in germany , tens of thousands of people expressed their sympathy with the united states and the victims of the attacks .
the wave of emotions appeared endless : shock , anger , despair and frustration were overwhelming .
memorial services were packed and many people hoped to find solace and comfort in the country ’ s churches .
prelate dr. heiner koch from the cologne archbishopric says the services in the city 's cathedral were much better attended in the days following sept .
11 than ever before .
" i also noticed that people ’ s sensitivity was higher in this time , " he told deutsche welle .
" i held the high mass on the sunday directly after the attacks , where i addressed what happened .
and i have never gotten so much response to a sermon as i did then . "
but , koch adds , this short-term reaction can not be mistaken for a fundamental change in germany ’ s religious landscape .
" i don ’ t believe that . "
searching for answers of course , it is difficult - if not impossible - to back up the impressions of prelate koch and other religious groups in germany with concrete figures .
after all , no one has sat at the church ’ s door over the past year , counting the faithful as they pour in .
but one fact that has materialized is an increased interest in islam .
herder verlag , germany ’ s leading publisher of religious and theological books , says its books on islamic belief and tradition became bestsellers overnight .
herder also noticed a rise in sales for other spiritual literature , including books on meditation .
it appears that many people were searching for meaning not so much in the church , as within themselves .
robert doetsch , or swami ramateertha , is head of the osho uta center for spiritual therapy and meditation in cologne , one of the largest spiritual centers in europe .
he confirms this development .
" after the initial shock subsided , people started becoming alive again .
and then the real questions arise , like why am i here , what do i really want ? "
he says he found these issues became more pressing after september 11th , and that the sharpness of the situation has continued .
" it has become more particular that the ones who are looking for a different way are doing so more strongly . "
but , he adds , people who are looking for answers in old values are also doing so more intently .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prayer prelate koch says he has noticed this tendency , too .
" i had the impression that people ’ s sense of security also collapsed with those towers .
the terror attacks made some things appear questionable .
and i believe that a lasting tendency is that people are questioning more now .
above all , i and many of my colleagues determined that people have become more open towards christian beliefs . "
" no world peace without a peace between religions . "
but the events of sept .
11 didn ’ t just lead to a shift in personal religious or spiritual activities .
as the increased interest in the koran and islamic literature showed , there was also a change in the way people viewed other religions .
annette esser heads the cologne / bonn branch of religions for peace , an inter-religious u.n. organization bringing together representatives of the world ’ s great religions .
she says it became important to many germans after the terror attacks to understand islam better and to improve inter-religious dialogue .
" the theologian hans küng said there will be no world peace without a peace between religions .
well , after sept .
11 , that saying became very urgent , " she says .
according to esser , a positive effect of sept .
11 has been the increased importance placed on inter-religious dialogue .
this exchange is crucial for the development of peace in the future , she says .
" really , religion is about peace , but it was misused for war .
and i think now , as it might be going to a war against iraq , we have more the feeling that we should enter into a dialogue with muslims worldwide , including iraq . "
for esser and many other theologians , religion could be an aid to develop dialogue in a peaceful way .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 a shift in belief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people are looking for the answers at church .
when the twin towers collapsed last sept .
11 , many people asked themselves how god could allow such a thing to happen .
but have the terrorist attacks changed people ’ s relationship to religion and belief ? it has been a year since the terror attacks of sept .
11 shocked the world .
in germany , tens of thousands of people expressed their sympathy with the united states and the victims of the attacks .
the wave of emotions appeared endless : shock , anger , despair and frustration were overwhelming .
memorial services were packed and many people hoped to find solace and comfort in the country ’ s churches .
prelate dr. heiner koch from the cologne archbishopric says the services in the city 's cathedral were much better attended in the days following sept .
11 than ever before .
" i also noticed that people ’ s sensitivity was higher in this time , " he told deutsche welle .
" i held the high mass on the sunday directly after the attacks , where i addressed what happened .
and i have never gotten so much response to a sermon as i did then . "
but , koch adds , this short-term reaction can not be mistaken for a fundamental change in germany ’ s religious landscape .
" i don ’ t believe that . "
searching for answers of course , it is difficult - if not impossible - to back up the impressions of prelate koch and other religious groups in germany with concrete figures .
after all , no one has sat at the church ’ s door over the past year , counting the faithful as they pour in .
but one fact that has materialized is an increased interest in islam .
herder verlag , germany ’ s leading publisher of religious and theological books , says its books on islamic belief and tradition became bestsellers overnight .
herder also noticed a rise in sales for other spiritual literature , including books on meditation .
it appears that many people were searching for meaning not so much in the church , as within themselves .
robert doetsch , or swami ramateertha , is head of the osho uta center for spiritual therapy and meditation in cologne , one of the largest spiritual centers in europe .
he confirms this development .
" after the initial shock subsided , people started becoming alive again .
and then the real questions arise , like why am i here , what do i really want ? "
he says he found these issues became more pressing after september 11th , and that the sharpness of the situation has continued .
" it has become more particular that the ones who are looking for a different way are doing so more strongly . "
but , he adds , people who are looking for answers in old values are also doing so more intently .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prayer prelate koch says he has noticed this tendency , too .
" i had the impression that people ’ s sense of security also collapsed with those towers .
the terror attacks made some things appear questionable .
and i believe that a lasting tendency is that people are questioning more now .
above all , i and many of my colleagues determined that people have become more open towards christian beliefs . "
" no world peace without a peace between religions . "
but the events of sept .
11 didn ’ t just lead to a shift in personal religious or spiritual activities .
as the increased interest in the koran and islamic literature showed , there was also a change in the way people viewed other religions .
annette esser heads the cologne / bonn branch of religions for peace , an inter-religious u.n. organization bringing together representatives of the world ’ s great religions .
she says it became important to many germans after the terror attacks to understand islam better and to improve inter-religious dialogue .
" the theologian hans küng said there will be no world peace without a peace between religions .
well , after sept .
11 , that saying became very urgent , " she says .
according to esser , a positive effect of sept .
11 has been the increased importance placed on inter-religious dialogue .
this exchange is crucial for the development of peace in the future , she says .
" really , religion is about peace , but it was misused for war .
and i think now , as it might be going to a war against iraq , we have more the feeling that we should enter into a dialogue with muslims worldwide , including iraq . "
for esser and many other theologians , religion could be an aid to develop dialogue in a peaceful way .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 a shift in belief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people are looking for the answers at church .
when the twin towers collapsed last sept .
11 , many people asked themselves how god could allow such a thing to happen .
but have the terrorist attacks changed people ’ s relationship to religion and belief ? it has been a year since the terror attacks of sept .
11 shocked the world .
in germany , tens of thousands of people expressed their sympathy with the united states and the victims of the attacks .
the wave of emotions appeared endless : shock , anger , despair and frustration were overwhelming .
memorial services were packed and many people hoped to find solace and comfort in the country ’ s churches .
prelate dr. heiner koch from the cologne archbishopric says the services in the city 's cathedral were much better attended in the days following sept .
11 than ever before .
" i also noticed that people ’ s sensitivity was higher in this time , " he told deutsche welle .
" i held the high mass on the sunday directly after the attacks , where i addressed what happened .
and i have never gotten so much response to a sermon as i did then . "
but , koch adds , this short-term reaction can not be mistaken for a fundamental change in germany ’ s religious landscape .
" i don ’ t believe that . "
searching for answers of course , it is difficult - if not impossible - to back up the impressions of prelate koch and other religious groups in germany with concrete figures .
after all , no one has sat at the church ’ s door over the past year , counting the faithful as they pour in .
but one fact that has materialized is an increased interest in islam .
herder verlag , germany ’ s leading publisher of religious and theological books , says its books on islamic belief and tradition became bestsellers overnight .
herder also noticed a rise in sales for other spiritual literature , including books on meditation .
it appears that many people were searching for meaning not so much in the church , as within themselves .
robert doetsch , or swami ramateertha , is head of the osho uta center for spiritual therapy and meditation in cologne , one of the largest spiritual centers in europe .
he confirms this development .
" after the initial shock subsided , people started becoming alive again .
and then the real questions arise , like why am i here , what do i really want ? "
he says he found these issues became more pressing after september 11th , and that the sharpness of the situation has continued .
" it has become more particular that the ones who are looking for a different way are doing so more strongly . "
but , he adds , people who are looking for answers in old values are also doing so more intently .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prayer prelate koch says he has noticed this tendency , too .
" i had the impression that people ’ s sense of security also collapsed with those towers .
the terror attacks made some things appear questionable .
and i believe that a lasting tendency is that people are questioning more now .
above all , i and many of my colleagues determined that people have become more open towards christian beliefs . "
" no world peace without a peace between religions . "
but the events of sept .
11 didn ’ t just lead to a shift in personal religious or spiritual activities .
as the increased interest in the koran and islamic literature showed , there was also a change in the way people viewed other religions .
annette esser heads the cologne / bonn branch of religions for peace , an inter-religious u.n. organization bringing together representatives of the world ’ s great religions .
she says it became important to many germans after the terror attacks to understand islam better and to improve inter-religious dialogue .
" the theologian hans küng said there will be no world peace without a peace between religions .
well , after sept .
11 , that saying became very urgent , " she says .
according to esser , a positive effect of sept .
11 has been the increased importance placed on inter-religious dialogue .
this exchange is crucial for the development of peace in the future , she says .
" really , religion is about peace , but it was misused for war .
and i think now , as it might be going to a war against iraq , we have more the feeling that we should enter into a dialogue with muslims worldwide , including iraq . "
for esser and many other theologians , religion could be an aid to develop dialogue in a peaceful way .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 a shift in belief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people are looking for the answers at church .
when the twin towers collapsed last sept .
11 , many people asked themselves how god could allow such a thing to happen .
but have the terrorist attacks changed people ’ s relationship to religion and belief ? it has been a year since the terror attacks of sept .
11 shocked the world .
in germany , tens of thousands of people expressed their sympathy with the united states and the victims of the attacks .
the wave of emotions appeared endless : shock , anger , despair and frustration were overwhelming .
memorial services were packed and many people hoped to find solace and comfort in the country ’ s churches .
prelate dr. heiner koch from the cologne archbishopric says the services in the city 's cathedral were much better attended in the days following sept .
11 than ever before .
" i also noticed that people ’ s sensitivity was higher in this time , " he told deutsche welle .
" i held the high mass on the sunday directly after the attacks , where i addressed what happened .
and i have never gotten so much response to a sermon as i did then . "
but , koch adds , this short-term reaction can not be mistaken for a fundamental change in germany ’ s religious landscape .
" i don ’ t believe that . "
searching for answers of course , it is difficult - if not impossible - to back up the impressions of prelate koch and other religious groups in germany with concrete figures .
after all , no one has sat at the church ’ s door over the past year , counting the faithful as they pour in .
but one fact that has materialized is an increased interest in islam .
herder verlag , germany ’ s leading publisher of religious and theological books , says its books on islamic belief and tradition became bestsellers overnight .
herder also noticed a rise in sales for other spiritual literature , including books on meditation .
it appears that many people were searching for meaning not so much in the church , as within themselves .
robert doetsch , or swami ramateertha , is head of the osho uta center for spiritual therapy and meditation in cologne , one of the largest spiritual centers in europe .
he confirms this development .
" after the initial shock subsided , people started becoming alive again .
and then the real questions arise , like why am i here , what do i really want ? "
he says he found these issues became more pressing after september 11th , and that the sharpness of the situation has continued .
" it has become more particular that the ones who are looking for a different way are doing so more strongly . "
but , he adds , people who are looking for answers in old values are also doing so more intently .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prayer prelate koch says he has noticed this tendency , too .
" i had the impression that people ’ s sense of security also collapsed with those towers .
the terror attacks made some things appear questionable .
and i believe that a lasting tendency is that people are questioning more now .
above all , i and many of my colleagues determined that people have become more open towards christian beliefs . "
" no world peace without a peace between religions . "
but the events of sept .
11 didn ’ t just lead to a shift in personal religious or spiritual activities .
as the increased interest in the koran and islamic literature showed , there was also a change in the way people viewed other religions .
annette esser heads the cologne / bonn branch of religions for peace , an inter-religious u.n. organization bringing together representatives of the world ’ s great religions .
she says it became important to many germans after the terror attacks to understand islam better and to improve inter-religious dialogue .
" the theologian hans küng said there will be no world peace without a peace between religions .
well , after sept .
11 , that saying became very urgent , " she says .
according to esser , a positive effect of sept .
11 has been the increased importance placed on inter-religious dialogue .
this exchange is crucial for the development of peace in the future , she says .
" really , religion is about peace , but it was misused for war .
and i think now , as it might be going to a war against iraq , we have more the feeling that we should enter into a dialogue with muslims worldwide , including iraq . "
for esser and many other theologians , religion could be an aid to develop dialogue in a peaceful way .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 a shift in belief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people are looking for the answers at church .
when the twin towers collapsed last sept .
11 , many people asked themselves how god could allow such a thing to happen .
but have the terrorist attacks changed people ’ s relationship to religion and belief ? it has been a year since the terror attacks of sept .
11 shocked the world .
in germany , tens of thousands of people expressed their sympathy with the united states and the victims of the attacks .
the wave of emotions appeared endless : shock , anger , despair and frustration were overwhelming .
memorial services were packed and many people hoped to find solace and comfort in the country ’ s churches .
prelate dr. heiner koch from the cologne archbishopric says the services in the city 's cathedral were much better attended in the days following sept .
11 than ever before .
" i also noticed that people ’ s sensitivity was higher in this time , " he told deutsche welle .
" i held the high mass on the sunday directly after the attacks , where i addressed what happened .
and i have never gotten so much response to a sermon as i did then . "
but , koch adds , this short-term reaction can not be mistaken for a fundamental change in germany ’ s religious landscape .
" i don ’ t believe that . "
searching for answers of course , it is difficult - if not impossible - to back up the impressions of prelate koch and other religious groups in germany with concrete figures .
after all , no one has sat at the church ’ s door over the past year , counting the faithful as they pour in .
but one fact that has materialized is an increased interest in islam .
herder verlag , germany ’ s leading publisher of religious and theological books , says its books on islamic belief and tradition became bestsellers overnight .
herder also noticed a rise in sales for other spiritual literature , including books on meditation .
it appears that many people were searching for meaning not so much in the church , as within themselves .
robert doetsch , or swami ramateertha , is head of the osho uta center for spiritual therapy and meditation in cologne , one of the largest spiritual centers in europe .
he confirms this development .
" after the initial shock subsided , people started becoming alive again .
and then the real questions arise , like why am i here , what do i really want ? "
he says he found these issues became more pressing after september 11th , and that the sharpness of the situation has continued .
" it has become more particular that the ones who are looking for a different way are doing so more strongly . "
but , he adds , people who are looking for answers in old values are also doing so more intently .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prayer prelate koch says he has noticed this tendency , too .
" i had the impression that people ’ s sense of security also collapsed with those towers .
the terror attacks made some things appear questionable .
and i believe that a lasting tendency is that people are questioning more now .
above all , i and many of my colleagues determined that people have become more open towards christian beliefs . "
" no world peace without a peace between religions . "
but the events of sept .
11 didn ’ t just lead to a shift in personal religious or spiritual activities .
as the increased interest in the koran and islamic literature showed , there was also a change in the way people viewed other religions .
annette esser heads the cologne / bonn branch of religions for peace , an inter-religious u.n. organization bringing together representatives of the world ’ s great religions .
she says it became important to many germans after the terror attacks to understand islam better and to improve inter-religious dialogue .
" the theologian hans küng said there will be no world peace without a peace between religions .
well , after sept .
11 , that saying became very urgent , " she says .
according to esser , a positive effect of sept .
11 has been the increased importance placed on inter-religious dialogue .
this exchange is crucial for the development of peace in the future , she says .
" really , religion is about peace , but it was misused for war .
and i think now , as it might be going to a war against iraq , we have more the feeling that we should enter into a dialogue with muslims worldwide , including iraq . "
for esser and many other theologians , religion could be an aid to develop dialogue in a peaceful way .
" it should not be a reason for war .
that would be a wrong perspective on religion .

he stands accused of the " gravest human rights violations " since wwii . slobodan milosevic faces the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia on friday in what is expected to be the weightiest part of his war crimes trial .
in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .
he has done it while at the same time refusing to recognize the tribunal as a legitimate judicial institution .
observers say the pressure is on the prosecution to do a better job of linking milosevic to atrocities with concrete evidence , something critics say un chief prosecutor carla del ponte failed to do during the first phase of the trial that ended four weeks ago .
" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .
he said each witness will shed " differing shafts of light " on milosevic 's responsibility for numerous crimes , including the massacre at the town of srebrenica that claimed 10,000 lives and the 46-week period where bosnian serbs laid siege to the city of sarajevo . he said the yugoslav army paid the bosnian serbs responsible for the siege of sarajevo even as milosevic publicly condemned it .
prosecutors also said serbian interior ministry police were involved in ethnic cleansing at srebrenica .
the attacks were part of a grander serb plan to carve out an ethnically-pure serbian state , said prosecutors , of which milosevic was involved .
" the systematic and organized way in which attacks against non-serb civilian populations in croatia were carried out revealed a carefully deisgned scheme and strategy within an overall plan that may be laid at the door of the accused , " nice said in opening statements .

in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .
he has done it while at the same time refusing to recognize the tribunal as a legitimate judicial institution .
observers say the pressure is on the prosecution to do a better job of linking milosevic to atrocities with concrete evidence , something critics say un chief prosecutor carla del ponte failed to do during the first phase of the trial that ended four weeks ago .
" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .
he said each witness will shed " differing shafts of light " on milosevic 's responsibility for numerous crimes , including the massacre at the town of srebrenica that claimed 10,000 lives and the 46-week period where bosnian serbs laid siege to the city of sarajevo . he said the yugoslav army paid the bosnian serbs responsible for the siege of sarajevo even as milosevic publicly condemned it .
prosecutors also said serbian interior ministry police were involved in ethnic cleansing at srebrenica .
the attacks were part of a grander serb plan to carve out an ethnically-pure serbian state , said prosecutors , of which milosevic was involved .
" the systematic and organized way in which attacks against non-serb civilian populations in croatia were carried out revealed a carefully deisgned scheme and strategy within an overall plan that may be laid at the door of the accused , " nice said in opening statements .

rival candidates vojislav kostunica and miroljub labus are expected to run head-to-head in second-round voting in two weeks time . the serbian people go to the polls this sunday to elect a new president .
opinion polls predict that current yugoslav president vojislav kostunica and yugoslav deputy prime minister miroljub labus will be the top two vote-getters in this first-round voting .
kostunica is expected to win in the second head-to-head runoff to be held two weeks later . the result of the election will have far-reaching consequences for continued economic and geo-political reforms taking place in serbia .
the current yugoslav federation , of which serbia is a part , is set to metamorphasise into a looser union , specified simply as montenegro and serbia . the post of serbian president will provide kostunica – whose opponents describe as the respectable face of hardline serbian nationalists – with the best chance of hanging on to power in the balkan region .
serbia is the largest state in the former yugoslavia . power struggle observers in the former yugloslavian state fear that victory for kostunica will result in an internal power stuggle between the serbian prime minister and the serbian president .
serbian prime minister zoran djindjic is backing labus . labus is a pro-market liberal and has been praised by western officials for introducing free-market reforms -lrb- together with djindjic -rrb- in serbia . kostunica - a 58-year-old law professor of the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- - describes himself as a moderate nationalist and argues that these reforms have been carried out badly and could cause future problems for the serbian economy . kostunica has said that establishing the democratic rule of law will be his top priority if he wins on sunday .
he also wants to oversee the creation of a new constitution and other laws to replace legislation dating from the authoritarian rule of slobodon milosevic .
“ mr. labus is fond of saying the economy is above everything .
for me , law is above everything … those are very serious and very principled differences between us , ” he told reuters news agency in an interview earlier this week .
kostunica has also fiercely criticised the u.n. war crimes tribunal , where milosevic is currently on trial .
kostunica accuses the tribunal of having an anti-serb bias .
he also caused outrage in ex-yugoslav bosnia when he declared at a campaign rally that serbia and bosnia were only “ temporarily separated ” .
the election campaign has been marred by growing racial tension in the state .
united nations police stopped ultra-nationalist leader vorjisla seselj from entering kosovo on thursday fearing his appearance at an election rally would stoke ethnic tensions .
un officials have discouraged serbian politicians from campaigning in the province , fearing outrage from the ethnic albanian majority who want complete independence for the region , placed under un control in 1999 .
the current serbian president , milan milutinovic , has already been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in the hague , and could be at risk of extradition once out of office at the end of the year . meanwhile on friday at the hague war crimes tribunal , milosevic faced the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia – the weightest section of the case against him . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid for serbia ?

rival candidates vojislav kostunica and miroljub labus are expected to run head-to-head in second-round voting in two weeks time . the serbian people go to the polls this sunday to elect a new president .
opinion polls predict that current yugoslav president vojislav kostunica and yugoslav deputy prime minister miroljub labus will be the top two vote-getters in this first-round voting .
kostunica is expected to win in the second head-to-head runoff to be held two weeks later . the result of the election will have far-reaching consequences for continued economic and geo-political reforms taking place in serbia .
the current yugoslav federation , of which serbia is a part , is set to metamorphasise into a looser union , specified simply as montenegro and serbia . the post of serbian president will provide kostunica – whose opponents describe as the respectable face of hardline serbian nationalists – with the best chance of hanging on to power in the balkan region .
serbia is the largest state in the former yugoslavia . power struggle observers in the former yugloslavian state fear that victory for kostunica will result in an internal power stuggle between the serbian prime minister and the serbian president .
serbian prime minister zoran djindjic is backing labus . labus is a pro-market liberal and has been praised by western officials for introducing free-market reforms -lrb- together with djindjic -rrb- in serbia . kostunica - a 58-year-old law professor of the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- - describes himself as a moderate nationalist and argues that these reforms have been carried out badly and could cause future problems for the serbian economy . kostunica has said that establishing the democratic rule of law will be his top priority if he wins on sunday .
he also wants to oversee the creation of a new constitution and other laws to replace legislation dating from the authoritarian rule of slobodon milosevic .
“ mr. labus is fond of saying the economy is above everything .
for me , law is above everything … those are very serious and very principled differences between us , ” he told reuters news agency in an interview earlier this week .
kostunica has also fiercely criticised the u.n. war crimes tribunal , where milosevic is currently on trial .
kostunica accuses the tribunal of having an anti-serb bias .
he also caused outrage in ex-yugoslav bosnia when he declared at a campaign rally that serbia and bosnia were only “ temporarily separated ” .

rival candidates vojislav kostunica and miroljub labus are expected to run head-to-head in second-round voting in two weeks time . the serbian people go to the polls this sunday to elect a new president .
opinion polls predict that current yugoslav president vojislav kostunica and yugoslav deputy prime minister miroljub labus will be the top two vote-getters in this first-round voting .
kostunica is expected to win in the second head-to-head runoff to be held two weeks later . the result of the election will have far-reaching consequences for continued economic and geo-political reforms taking place in serbia .
the current yugoslav federation , of which serbia is a part , is set to metamorphasise into a looser union , specified simply as montenegro and serbia . the post of serbian president will provide kostunica – whose opponents describe as the respectable face of hardline serbian nationalists – with the best chance of hanging on to power in the balkan region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 german bishops send tough message to paedophilic priests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann -lrb- right -rrb- at the opening of the four-day conference catholic bishops in germany have adopted a series of tough resolutions to prevent child sex abuse in parishes and to restore the badly-shaken trust in the church . for the first time since the german catholic church was rocked by a series of paedophilia scandals , a four-day bishop ’ s conference in fulda has decided to get cracking on paedophilic priests .
at the conclusion of the meeting on thursday , the 68 bishops from dioceses all over the country came together under the chairmanship of cardinal lehmann and admitted for the first time to " often reacting inappropriately " in previous cases of sexual abuse in the church .
tougher action against paedophilic priests the bishops also decided to pursue a more intensive examination of accusations of sexual abuse in the church in the future .
this would involve appointing an external ombudsman in every diocese who would serve as a contact person for victims of sexual abuse as well as suspicious priests .
until now , each of germany ’ s 27 dioceses had its own method of dealing with the problem , which most often involved immediately suspending the priests and then transferring them out of their parishes .
in addition , the clerics also decided to initiate an internal inquiry in paedophilic cases before the criminal prosecution authorities intervened .
only once sexual abuse of children and youth were proved , would the guilty priest be advised to give himself up to police officials .
victims of sexual abuse will also be offered humanitarian , therapeutic and pastoral help in the future , and it will be mandatory for paedophilic priests to undergo therapy henceforth .
the bishops also did not rule out defrocking a guilty priest in certain serious cases .
paedophilia a sticky issue with church authorities but despite the wide-sweeping measures , the question of paedophilia still sits uneasily with the german catholic church as comments by cardinal lehmann in fulda showed .
on friday cardinal lehmann said that priests under suspicion of wrongdoing face intense public pressure to confess their deeds .
at the same time he said that hurling accusations of sexual abuse at priests had almost become common-place and an excuse to hit at priests .
he said the church reckoned with unending complaints against clerics in dioceses where they weren ’ t popular .
" suspicions are quickly formed , if one wants to get at a priest , " lehmann said .
these people -lrb- the priests -rrb- are then " destroyed " for life , he concluded .
another grey area for the catholic church in germany is the fact that the vatican in rome will have the final say in each case of sexual abuse .
according to the new resolutions , each serious case has to be referred to the vatican especially if suspicions against a priest are proved true .
lehmann made it clear that he expected dealing with directives from distant rome to be problematic .
" how that is actually going to work in reality is still not clear to me , " he said .
german catholic church hit by scandals following the paedophilia scandal in the united states involving more than a hundred priests last spring , the catholic church in germany too has come under intense pressure after it was hit by a string of scandals in recent months .
numerous cases of paedophilia concerning catholic priests have surfaced , including in cardinal lehmann ’ s own diocese in mainz .
the revelations have caused " massive damage " to the church , said lehmann during the opening of the conference .
church under fire for passive aid to nazis the four-day bishops conference this week has not just been under pressure to do more against paedophilic priests , but has also been grappling with allegations of providing passive aid to the nazis under hitler ’ s dictatorship .
in an interview with the german magazine stern this week , american author daniel goldhagen of the book hitler ’ s willing executioners , said the catholic church " actively and willingly helped to push the race law by protecting access to lineage documents in the church archive , " during hitler ’ s reign .
goldhagen gave the interview in advance of his new book the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair .
" the church and clergy in all of europe undisputedly carried out and supported crimes against jews , " goldhagen says in the interview .
germany ’ s cardinal karl lehmann rejected the accusations , saying the church helped protect 80 percent of the 900,000 jews that survived the holocaust .
he did regret that pope pius xii didn ’ t openly oppose the holocaust and admitted that an anti-semitic groundswell was still present in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's catholic church ambivalent about pedophilia priestly pedophilia isn ’ t a uniquely american phenomenon .
germany ’ s church has been struggling with the issue - reluctantly - for years .

he stands accused of the " gravest human rights violations " since wwii . slobodan milosevic faces the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia on friday in what is expected to be the weightiest part of his war crimes trial .
in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .
he has done it while at the same time refusing to recognize the tribunal as a legitimate judicial institution .
observers say the pressure is on the prosecution to do a better job of linking milosevic to atrocities with concrete evidence , something critics say un chief prosecutor carla del ponte failed to do during the first phase of the trial that ended four weeks ago .
" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .

rival candidates vojislav kostunica and miroljub labus are expected to run head-to-head in second-round voting in two weeks time . the serbian people go to the polls this sunday to elect a new president .
opinion polls predict that current yugoslav president vojislav kostunica and yugoslav deputy prime minister miroljub labus will be the top two vote-getters in this first-round voting .
kostunica is expected to win in the second head-to-head runoff to be held two weeks later . the result of the election will have far-reaching consequences for continued economic and geo-political reforms taking place in serbia .
the current yugoslav federation , of which serbia is a part , is set to metamorphasise into a looser union , specified simply as montenegro and serbia . the post of serbian president will provide kostunica – whose opponents describe as the respectable face of hardline serbian nationalists – with the best chance of hanging on to power in the balkan region .
serbia is the largest state in the former yugoslavia . power struggle observers in the former yugloslavian state fear that victory for kostunica will result in an internal power stuggle between the serbian prime minister and the serbian president .
serbian prime minister zoran djindjic is backing labus . labus is a pro-market liberal and has been praised by western officials for introducing free-market reforms -lrb- together with djindjic -rrb- in serbia . kostunica - a 58-year-old law professor of the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- - describes himself as a moderate nationalist and argues that these reforms have been carried out badly and could cause future problems for the serbian economy . kostunica has said that establishing the democratic rule of law will be his top priority if he wins on sunday .
he also wants to oversee the creation of a new constitution and other laws to replace legislation dating from the authoritarian rule of slobodon milosevic .
“ mr. labus is fond of saying the economy is above everything .
for me , law is above everything … those are very serious and very principled differences between us , ” he told reuters news agency in an interview earlier this week .
kostunica has also fiercely criticised the u.n. war crimes tribunal , where milosevic is currently on trial .
kostunica accuses the tribunal of having an anti-serb bias .
he also caused outrage in ex-yugoslav bosnia when he declared at a campaign rally that serbia and bosnia were only “ temporarily separated ” .
the election campaign has been marred by growing racial tension in the state .
united nations police stopped ultra-nationalist leader vorjisla seselj from entering kosovo on thursday fearing his appearance at an election rally would stoke ethnic tensions .
un officials have discouraged serbian politicians from campaigning in the province , fearing outrage from the ethnic albanian majority who want complete independence for the region , placed under un control in 1999 .
the current serbian president , milan milutinovic , has already been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in the hague , and could be at risk of extradition once out of office at the end of the year . meanwhile on friday at the hague war crimes tribunal , milosevic faced the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia – the weightest section of the case against him . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid for serbia ?

he stands accused of the " gravest human rights violations " since wwii . slobodan milosevic faces the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia on friday in what is expected to be the weightiest part of his war crimes trial .
in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .
he has done it while at the same time refusing to recognize the tribunal as a legitimate judicial institution .
observers say the pressure is on the prosecution to do a better job of linking milosevic to atrocities with concrete evidence , something critics say un chief prosecutor carla del ponte failed to do during the first phase of the trial that ended four weeks ago .
" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .
he said each witness will shed " differing shafts of light " on milosevic 's responsibility for numerous crimes , including the massacre at the town of srebrenica that claimed 10,000 lives and the 46-week period where bosnian serbs laid siege to the city of sarajevo . he said the yugoslav army paid the bosnian serbs responsible for the siege of sarajevo even as milosevic publicly condemned it .

he stands accused of the " gravest human rights violations " since wwii . slobodan milosevic faces the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia on friday in what is expected to be the weightiest part of his war crimes trial .
in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .
he has done it while at the same time refusing to recognize the tribunal as a legitimate judicial institution .
observers say the pressure is on the prosecution to do a better job of linking milosevic to atrocities with concrete evidence , something critics say un chief prosecutor carla del ponte failed to do during the first phase of the trial that ended four weeks ago .
" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .
he said each witness will shed " differing shafts of light " on milosevic 's responsibility for numerous crimes , including the massacre at the town of srebrenica that claimed 10,000 lives and the 46-week period where bosnian serbs laid siege to the city of sarajevo . he said the yugoslav army paid the bosnian serbs responsible for the siege of sarajevo even as milosevic publicly condemned it .
prosecutors also said serbian interior ministry police were involved in ethnic cleansing at srebrenica .
the attacks were part of a grander serb plan to carve out an ethnically-pure serbian state , said prosecutors , of which milosevic was involved .
" the systematic and organized way in which attacks against non-serb civilian populations in croatia were carried out revealed a carefully deisgned scheme and strategy within an overall plan that may be laid at the door of the accused , " nice said in opening statements .

at the conclusion of the meeting on thursday , the 68 bishops from dioceses all over the country came together under the chairmanship of cardinal lehmann and admitted for the first time to " often reacting inappropriately " in previous cases of sexual abuse in the church .
tougher action against paedophilic priests the bishops also decided to pursue a more intensive examination of accusations of sexual abuse in the church in the future .
this would involve appointing an external ombudsman in every diocese who would serve as a contact person for victims of sexual abuse as well as suspicious priests .
until now , each of germany ’ s 27 dioceses had its own method of dealing with the problem , which most often involved immediately suspending the priests and then transferring them out of their parishes .
in addition , the clerics also decided to initiate an internal inquiry in paedophilic cases before the criminal prosecution authorities intervened .
only once sexual abuse of children and youth were proved , would the guilty priest be advised to give himself up to police officials .
victims of sexual abuse will also be offered humanitarian , therapeutic and pastoral help in the future , and it will be mandatory for paedophilic priests to undergo therapy henceforth .
the bishops also did not rule out defrocking a guilty priest in certain serious cases .
paedophilia a sticky issue with church authorities but despite the wide-sweeping measures , the question of paedophilia still sits uneasily with the german catholic church as comments by cardinal lehmann in fulda showed .
on friday cardinal lehmann said that priests under suspicion of wrongdoing face intense public pressure to confess their deeds .
at the same time he said that hurling accusations of sexual abuse at priests had almost become common-place and an excuse to hit at priests .
he said the church reckoned with unending complaints against clerics in dioceses where they weren ’ t popular .
" suspicions are quickly formed , if one wants to get at a priest , " lehmann said .
these people -lrb- the priests -rrb- are then " destroyed " for life , he concluded .
another grey area for the catholic church in germany is the fact that the vatican in rome will have the final say in each case of sexual abuse .
according to the new resolutions , each serious case has to be referred to the vatican especially if suspicions against a priest are proved true .
lehmann made it clear that he expected dealing with directives from distant rome to be problematic .
" how that is actually going to work in reality is still not clear to me , " he said .
german catholic church hit by scandals following the paedophilia scandal in the united states involving more than a hundred priests last spring , the catholic church in germany too has come under intense pressure after it was hit by a string of scandals in recent months .
numerous cases of paedophilia concerning catholic priests have surfaced , including in cardinal lehmann ’ s own diocese in mainz .
the revelations have caused " massive damage " to the church , said lehmann during the opening of the conference .
church under fire for passive aid to nazis the four-day bishops conference this week has not just been under pressure to do more against paedophilic priests , but has also been grappling with allegations of providing passive aid to the nazis under hitler ’ s dictatorship .
in an interview with the german magazine stern this week , american author daniel goldhagen of the book hitler ’ s willing executioners , said the catholic church " actively and willingly helped to push the race law by protecting access to lineage documents in the church archive , " during hitler ’ s reign .
goldhagen gave the interview in advance of his new book the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair .
" the church and clergy in all of europe undisputedly carried out and supported crimes against jews , " goldhagen says in the interview .
germany ’ s cardinal karl lehmann rejected the accusations , saying the church helped protect 80 percent of the 900,000 jews that survived the holocaust .

rival candidates vojislav kostunica and miroljub labus are expected to run head-to-head in second-round voting in two weeks time . the serbian people go to the polls this sunday to elect a new president .
opinion polls predict that current yugoslav president vojislav kostunica and yugoslav deputy prime minister miroljub labus will be the top two vote-getters in this first-round voting .
kostunica is expected to win in the second head-to-head runoff to be held two weeks later . the result of the election will have far-reaching consequences for continued economic and geo-political reforms taking place in serbia .
the current yugoslav federation , of which serbia is a part , is set to metamorphasise into a looser union , specified simply as montenegro and serbia . the post of serbian president will provide kostunica – whose opponents describe as the respectable face of hardline serbian nationalists – with the best chance of hanging on to power in the balkan region .
serbia is the largest state in the former yugoslavia . power struggle observers in the former yugloslavian state fear that victory for kostunica will result in an internal power stuggle between the serbian prime minister and the serbian president .
serbian prime minister zoran djindjic is backing labus . labus is a pro-market liberal and has been praised by western officials for introducing free-market reforms -lrb- together with djindjic -rrb- in serbia . kostunica - a 58-year-old law professor of the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- - describes himself as a moderate nationalist and argues that these reforms have been carried out badly and could cause future problems for the serbian economy . kostunica has said that establishing the democratic rule of law will be his top priority if he wins on sunday .
he also wants to oversee the creation of a new constitution and other laws to replace legislation dating from the authoritarian rule of slobodon milosevic .
“ mr. labus is fond of saying the economy is above everything .
for me , law is above everything … those are very serious and very principled differences between us , ” he told reuters news agency in an interview earlier this week .
kostunica has also fiercely criticised the u.n. war crimes tribunal , where milosevic is currently on trial .
kostunica accuses the tribunal of having an anti-serb bias .
he also caused outrage in ex-yugoslav bosnia when he declared at a campaign rally that serbia and bosnia were only “ temporarily separated ” .
the election campaign has been marred by growing racial tension in the state .
united nations police stopped ultra-nationalist leader vorjisla seselj from entering kosovo on thursday fearing his appearance at an election rally would stoke ethnic tensions .
un officials have discouraged serbian politicians from campaigning in the province , fearing outrage from the ethnic albanian majority who want complete independence for the region , placed under un control in 1999 .
the current serbian president , milan milutinovic , has already been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in the hague , and could be at risk of extradition once out of office at the end of the year . meanwhile on friday at the hague war crimes tribunal , milosevic faced the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia – the weightest section of the case against him . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid for serbia ?

serbian prime minister zoran djindjic is backing labus . labus is a pro-market liberal and has been praised by western officials for introducing free-market reforms -lrb- together with djindjic -rrb- in serbia . kostunica - a 58-year-old law professor of the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- - describes himself as a moderate nationalist and argues that these reforms have been carried out badly and could cause future problems for the serbian economy . kostunica has said that establishing the democratic rule of law will be his top priority if he wins on sunday .
he also wants to oversee the creation of a new constitution and other laws to replace legislation dating from the authoritarian rule of slobodon milosevic .
“ mr. labus is fond of saying the economy is above everything .
for me , law is above everything … those are very serious and very principled differences between us , ” he told reuters news agency in an interview earlier this week .
kostunica has also fiercely criticised the u.n. war crimes tribunal , where milosevic is currently on trial .
kostunica accuses the tribunal of having an anti-serb bias .
he also caused outrage in ex-yugoslav bosnia when he declared at a campaign rally that serbia and bosnia were only “ temporarily separated ” .
the election campaign has been marred by growing racial tension in the state .
united nations police stopped ultra-nationalist leader vorjisla seselj from entering kosovo on thursday fearing his appearance at an election rally would stoke ethnic tensions .
un officials have discouraged serbian politicians from campaigning in the province , fearing outrage from the ethnic albanian majority who want complete independence for the region , placed under un control in 1999 .
the current serbian president , milan milutinovic , has already been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in the hague , and could be at risk of extradition once out of office at the end of the year . meanwhile on friday at the hague war crimes tribunal , milosevic faced the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia – the weightest section of the case against him . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid for serbia ?

at the conclusion of the meeting on thursday , the 68 bishops from dioceses all over the country came together under the chairmanship of cardinal lehmann and admitted for the first time to " often reacting inappropriately " in previous cases of sexual abuse in the church .
tougher action against paedophilic priests the bishops also decided to pursue a more intensive examination of accusations of sexual abuse in the church in the future .
this would involve appointing an external ombudsman in every diocese who would serve as a contact person for victims of sexual abuse as well as suspicious priests .
until now , each of germany ’ s 27 dioceses had its own method of dealing with the problem , which most often involved immediately suspending the priests and then transferring them out of their parishes .
in addition , the clerics also decided to initiate an internal inquiry in paedophilic cases before the criminal prosecution authorities intervened .
only once sexual abuse of children and youth were proved , would the guilty priest be advised to give himself up to police officials .

lehmann made it clear that he expected dealing with directives from distant rome to be problematic .

he stands accused of the " gravest human rights violations " since wwii . slobodan milosevic faces the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia on friday in what is expected to be the weightiest part of his war crimes trial .
in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .

" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .
he said each witness will shed " differing shafts of light " on milosevic 's responsibility for numerous crimes , including the massacre at the town of srebrenica that claimed 10,000 lives and the 46-week period where bosnian serbs laid siege to the city of sarajevo . he said the yugoslav army paid the bosnian serbs responsible for the siege of sarajevo even as milosevic publicly condemned it .
prosecutors also said serbian interior ministry police were involved in ethnic cleansing at srebrenica .
the attacks were part of a grander serb plan to carve out an ethnically-pure serbian state , said prosecutors , of which milosevic was involved .
" the systematic and organized way in which attacks against non-serb civilian populations in croatia were carried out revealed a carefully deisgned scheme and strategy within an overall plan that may be laid at the door of the accused , " nice said in opening statements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 german bishops send tough message to paedophilic priests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann -lrb- right -rrb- at the opening of the four-day conference catholic bishops in germany have adopted a series of tough resolutions to prevent child sex abuse in parishes and to restore the badly-shaken trust in the church . for the first time since the german catholic church was rocked by a series of paedophilia scandals , a four-day bishop ’ s conference in fulda has decided to get cracking on paedophilic priests .
at the conclusion of the meeting on thursday , the 68 bishops from dioceses all over the country came together under the chairmanship of cardinal lehmann and admitted for the first time to " often reacting inappropriately " in previous cases of sexual abuse in the church .
tougher action against paedophilic priests the bishops also decided to pursue a more intensive examination of accusations of sexual abuse in the church in the future .
this would involve appointing an external ombudsman in every diocese who would serve as a contact person for victims of sexual abuse as well as suspicious priests .
until now , each of germany ’ s 27 dioceses had its own method of dealing with the problem , which most often involved immediately suspending the priests and then transferring them out of their parishes .
in addition , the clerics also decided to initiate an internal inquiry in paedophilic cases before the criminal prosecution authorities intervened .
only once sexual abuse of children and youth were proved , would the guilty priest be advised to give himself up to police officials .
victims of sexual abuse will also be offered humanitarian , therapeutic and pastoral help in the future , and it will be mandatory for paedophilic priests to undergo therapy henceforth .
the bishops also did not rule out defrocking a guilty priest in certain serious cases .
paedophilia a sticky issue with church authorities but despite the wide-sweeping measures , the question of paedophilia still sits uneasily with the german catholic church as comments by cardinal lehmann in fulda showed .
on friday cardinal lehmann said that priests under suspicion of wrongdoing face intense public pressure to confess their deeds .
at the same time he said that hurling accusations of sexual abuse at priests had almost become common-place and an excuse to hit at priests .
he said the church reckoned with unending complaints against clerics in dioceses where they weren ’ t popular .
" suspicions are quickly formed , if one wants to get at a priest , " lehmann said .
these people -lrb- the priests -rrb- are then " destroyed " for life , he concluded .
another grey area for the catholic church in germany is the fact that the vatican in rome will have the final say in each case of sexual abuse .
according to the new resolutions , each serious case has to be referred to the vatican especially if suspicions against a priest are proved true .
lehmann made it clear that he expected dealing with directives from distant rome to be problematic .
" how that is actually going to work in reality is still not clear to me , " he said .
german catholic church hit by scandals following the paedophilia scandal in the united states involving more than a hundred priests last spring , the catholic church in germany too has come under intense pressure after it was hit by a string of scandals in recent months .
numerous cases of paedophilia concerning catholic priests have surfaced , including in cardinal lehmann ’ s own diocese in mainz .
the revelations have caused " massive damage " to the church , said lehmann during the opening of the conference .
church under fire for passive aid to nazis the four-day bishops conference this week has not just been under pressure to do more against paedophilic priests , but has also been grappling with allegations of providing passive aid to the nazis under hitler ’ s dictatorship .
in an interview with the german magazine stern this week , american author daniel goldhagen of the book hitler ’ s willing executioners , said the catholic church " actively and willingly helped to push the race law by protecting access to lineage documents in the church archive , " during hitler ’ s reign .
goldhagen gave the interview in advance of his new book the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair .
" the church and clergy in all of europe undisputedly carried out and supported crimes against jews , " goldhagen says in the interview .
germany ’ s cardinal karl lehmann rejected the accusations , saying the church helped protect 80 percent of the 900,000 jews that survived the holocaust .
he did regret that pope pius xii didn ’ t openly oppose the holocaust and admitted that an anti-semitic groundswell was still present in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's catholic church ambivalent about pedophilia priestly pedophilia isn ’ t a uniquely american phenomenon .

he stands accused of the " gravest human rights violations " since wwii . slobodan milosevic faces the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia on friday in what is expected to be the weightiest part of his war crimes trial .
in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .
he has done it while at the same time refusing to recognize the tribunal as a legitimate judicial institution .
observers say the pressure is on the prosecution to do a better job of linking milosevic to atrocities with concrete evidence , something critics say un chief prosecutor carla del ponte failed to do during the first phase of the trial that ended four weeks ago .
" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .
he said each witness will shed " differing shafts of light " on milosevic 's responsibility for numerous crimes , including the massacre at the town of srebrenica that claimed 10,000 lives and the 46-week period where bosnian serbs laid siege to the city of sarajevo . he said the yugoslav army paid the bosnian serbs responsible for the siege of sarajevo even as milosevic publicly condemned it .
prosecutors also said serbian interior ministry police were involved in ethnic cleansing at srebrenica .
the attacks were part of a grander serb plan to carve out an ethnically-pure serbian state , said prosecutors , of which milosevic was involved .
" the systematic and organized way in which attacks against non-serb civilian populations in croatia were carried out revealed a carefully deisgned scheme and strategy within an overall plan that may be laid at the door of the accused , " nice said in opening statements .
cooperation still " fractious " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : march 17 2000 file photo of army general dragoljub ojdanic , center , the former yugoslav army commander during the regime of slobodan milosevic , 2nd from right .
ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / str / files -rrb- chief prosecutor del ponte gave a few short remarks at the beginning of thursday 's proceedings , lamenting yugoslavia 's " fractious " cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in ththe hague .
she urged the current yugoslavian government to send more of milosevic 's aides to testify .
bosnian protestors outside of the trial demanded renewed efforts to capture war criminals radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , who have so far eluded the grasp of nato troops in the balkans .
around 177 witnesses will be called by the prosecution in this phase of the trial , including prominents like croatian president stjepan mesic and usa top diplomat and un ambassador richard holbrooke . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic launches vigorous defence accused of genocide and war crimes , the former yugoslav president ridicules the un court as his lawless captor and launches a robust defence , aided by gory photographs of civilians killed by nato bombs .

at the conclusion of the meeting on thursday , the 68 bishops from dioceses all over the country came together under the chairmanship of cardinal lehmann and admitted for the first time to " often reacting inappropriately " in previous cases of sexual abuse in the church .
tougher action against paedophilic priests the bishops also decided to pursue a more intensive examination of accusations of sexual abuse in the church in the future .
this would involve appointing an external ombudsman in every diocese who would serve as a contact person for victims of sexual abuse as well as suspicious priests .
until now , each of germany ’ s 27 dioceses had its own method of dealing with the problem , which most often involved immediately suspending the priests and then transferring them out of their parishes .
in addition , the clerics also decided to initiate an internal inquiry in paedophilic cases before the criminal prosecution authorities intervened .
only once sexual abuse of children and youth were proved , would the guilty priest be advised to give himself up to police officials .
victims of sexual abuse will also be offered humanitarian , therapeutic and pastoral help in the future , and it will be mandatory for paedophilic priests to undergo therapy henceforth .

paedophilia a sticky issue with church authorities but despite the wide-sweeping measures , the question of paedophilia still sits uneasily with the german catholic church as comments by cardinal lehmann in fulda showed .

at the same time he said that hurling accusations of sexual abuse at priests had almost become common-place and an excuse to hit at priests .
he said the church reckoned with unending complaints against clerics in dioceses where they weren ’ t popular .
" suspicions are quickly formed , if one wants to get at a priest , " lehmann said .

another grey area for the catholic church in germany is the fact that the vatican in rome will have the final say in each case of sexual abuse .
according to the new resolutions , each serious case has to be referred to the vatican especially if suspicions against a priest are proved true .
lehmann made it clear that he expected dealing with directives from distant rome to be problematic .
" how that is actually going to work in reality is still not clear to me , " he said .
german catholic church hit by scandals following the paedophilia scandal in the united states involving more than a hundred priests last spring , the catholic church in germany too has come under intense pressure after it was hit by a string of scandals in recent months .
numerous cases of paedophilia concerning catholic priests have surfaced , including in cardinal lehmann ’ s own diocese in mainz .
the revelations have caused " massive damage " to the church , said lehmann during the opening of the conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.09.2002 german stock exchange closes neuer markt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's neuer markt goes from boom to bust in five years after suffering through a five-year roller coaster ride , the german stock exchange on thursday bid farewell to its neuer markt segment , thereby bringing about an end to the high-growth dreams of the dot.com era . the deutsche börse ag , the company which operates the german stock exchange , announced late thursday that it planned to shut the door on its technology and high-growth neuer markt segment by the end of 2003 .
the closure is part of a major drive to overhaul the structure of the stock exchange , create market transparency and boost investor confidence .
germany ’ s neuer markt , once touted as europe ’ s answer to the tech-heavy u.s. nasdaq , was launched in april 1997 as the leading european market for new economy issues .
young , growth-oriented companies from the fields of telecommunications , biotechnology and multi-media were listed in what was intended to be a fast-track path to high dividends .
short-lived dreams in the early days , when the high-tech and internet segment was mushrooming with new start-ups , the neuer markt grew rapidly , expanding from just two listings in the initial year to a record 133 at the market ’ s peak in 2000 .
at the time there was nothing like it in germany , and the neuer markt ’ s leading share index , the nemax50 , quickly reached all-time highs of 9,000 points .
an entire industry of market analysts , investment bankers , and financial consultants thrived in the off-shoots of the neuer markt .
it was trumpeted as the fast path to riches for small-time investors looking to dabble on the stock market .
and many readily accepted the market ’ s get-rich-quick promises as a financial mantra – that is until the new economy bubble burst and the market began to falter .
after a record spurt in early 2000 , interest in the high-tech and telecom sector quickly dried up .
over the last two years what little was left of investor confidence evaporated in the wake of a wave of corporate failures and financial scandals .
since the beginning of 2002 , more than 60 companies left the neuer markt .
on thursday the nemax50 was hovering at around 367 points .
" the neuer markt is not functioning any more ... the market segment for growth stocks is a farce , " said germany ’ s financial daily , handelsblatt .
" the move to shut it has been anticipated by many and is long overdue . "
new structures bring new hope deutsche börse launched a campaign to revive the neuer markt last year , vowing to keep the high-profile segment afloat .
at first it tried to restore investor confidence by kicking out so-called penny stocks and tightening up listing rules .
but when investors continued to stay away , the exchange was forced to take drastic steps .
wolfgang gerke , economics professor and an expert in banking and stock markets at the university of erlangen , told dw-radio that the deutsche börse was forced to do something and it did the right thing .
pulling the plug on the neuer markt was the only " logical step . "
now the börse is reorganizing trading on its exchanges by dividing the entire market into two new segments with different transparency standards , the domestic standard and prime standard .
the domestic standard segment will have minimum transparency requirements , and is primarily designed as a starting block for newer and smaller companies who are not quite ready to have all of their costs become public .
the prime standard will have increased transparency regulations along the lines of international requirements such as quarterly earnings reports , adherence to international accounting standards , presentation of a corporate calendar , at least one analysts ’ conference per year , " ad hoc " disclosure -lrb- company announcements issued through deutsche börse -rrb- , and ongoing reporting in english .
" the new segmentation is aimed at higher integrity and attractiveness of the capital market for investors and issuers .
investors can differentiate between the regulatory standards with which the companies have agree to comply , and issuers meet their individual financing needs , " the deutsche börse said on thursday .
but market experts warn not to expect too much too soon .
investors will only come back once the stocks begin to rise .
and that will only happen once the economy starts to get better , says gerke . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neuer markt ’ s birthday blues the german stock exchange 's market for growth and technology stocks , the neuer markt , celebrates its fifth birthday .

with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .
he has done it while at the same time refusing to recognize the tribunal as a legitimate judicial institution .
observers say the pressure is on the prosecution to do a better job of linking milosevic to atrocities with concrete evidence , something critics say un chief prosecutor carla del ponte failed to do during the first phase of the trial that ended four weeks ago .
" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .
he said each witness will shed " differing shafts of light " on milosevic 's responsibility for numerous crimes , including the massacre at the town of srebrenica that claimed 10,000 lives and the 46-week period where bosnian serbs laid siege to the city of sarajevo . he said the yugoslav army paid the bosnian serbs responsible for the siege of sarajevo even as milosevic publicly condemned it .
prosecutors also said serbian interior ministry police were involved in ethnic cleansing at srebrenica .
the attacks were part of a grander serb plan to carve out an ethnically-pure serbian state , said prosecutors , of which milosevic was involved .
" the systematic and organized way in which attacks against non-serb civilian populations in croatia were carried out revealed a carefully deisgned scheme and strategy within an overall plan that may be laid at the door of the accused , " nice said in opening statements .

ojdanic surrendered to the u.n war crimes tribunal and flew to the hague , netherlands on a commercial yugoslav airlines flight thursday april 25 2002 .
-lrb- ap photo / str / files -rrb- chief prosecutor del ponte gave a few short remarks at the beginning of thursday 's proceedings , lamenting yugoslavia 's " fractious " cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in ththe hague .
she urged the current yugoslavian government to send more of milosevic 's aides to testify .
bosnian protestors outside of the trial demanded renewed efforts to capture war criminals radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , who have so far eluded the grasp of nato troops in the balkans .
around 177 witnesses will be called by the prosecution in this phase of the trial , including prominents like croatian president stjepan mesic and usa top diplomat and un ambassador richard holbrooke . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic launches vigorous defence accused of genocide and war crimes , the former yugoslav president ridicules the un court as his lawless captor and launches a robust defence , aided by gory photographs of civilians killed by nato bombs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 german bishops send tough message to paedophilic priests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann -lrb- right -rrb- at the opening of the four-day conference catholic bishops in germany have adopted a series of tough resolutions to prevent child sex abuse in parishes and to restore the badly-shaken trust in the church . for the first time since the german catholic church was rocked by a series of paedophilia scandals , a four-day bishop ’ s conference in fulda has decided to get cracking on paedophilic priests .
at the conclusion of the meeting on thursday , the 68 bishops from dioceses all over the country came together under the chairmanship of cardinal lehmann and admitted for the first time to " often reacting inappropriately " in previous cases of sexual abuse in the church .
tougher action against paedophilic priests the bishops also decided to pursue a more intensive examination of accusations of sexual abuse in the church in the future .
this would involve appointing an external ombudsman in every diocese who would serve as a contact person for victims of sexual abuse as well as suspicious priests .
until now , each of germany ’ s 27 dioceses had its own method of dealing with the problem , which most often involved immediately suspending the priests and then transferring them out of their parishes .
in addition , the clerics also decided to initiate an internal inquiry in paedophilic cases before the criminal prosecution authorities intervened .
only once sexual abuse of children and youth were proved , would the guilty priest be advised to give himself up to police officials .
victims of sexual abuse will also be offered humanitarian , therapeutic and pastoral help in the future , and it will be mandatory for paedophilic priests to undergo therapy henceforth .
the bishops also did not rule out defrocking a guilty priest in certain serious cases .
paedophilia a sticky issue with church authorities but despite the wide-sweeping measures , the question of paedophilia still sits uneasily with the german catholic church as comments by cardinal lehmann in fulda showed .
on friday cardinal lehmann said that priests under suspicion of wrongdoing face intense public pressure to confess their deeds .
at the same time he said that hurling accusations of sexual abuse at priests had almost become common-place and an excuse to hit at priests .
he said the church reckoned with unending complaints against clerics in dioceses where they weren ’ t popular .
" suspicions are quickly formed , if one wants to get at a priest , " lehmann said .
these people -lrb- the priests -rrb- are then " destroyed " for life , he concluded .
another grey area for the catholic church in germany is the fact that the vatican in rome will have the final say in each case of sexual abuse .
according to the new resolutions , each serious case has to be referred to the vatican especially if suspicions against a priest are proved true .
lehmann made it clear that he expected dealing with directives from distant rome to be problematic .
" how that is actually going to work in reality is still not clear to me , " he said .
german catholic church hit by scandals following the paedophilia scandal in the united states involving more than a hundred priests last spring , the catholic church in germany too has come under intense pressure after it was hit by a string of scandals in recent months .
numerous cases of paedophilia concerning catholic priests have surfaced , including in cardinal lehmann ’ s own diocese in mainz .
the revelations have caused " massive damage " to the church , said lehmann during the opening of the conference .
church under fire for passive aid to nazis the four-day bishops conference this week has not just been under pressure to do more against paedophilic priests , but has also been grappling with allegations of providing passive aid to the nazis under hitler ’ s dictatorship .
in an interview with the german magazine stern this week , american author daniel goldhagen of the book hitler ’ s willing executioners , said the catholic church " actively and willingly helped to push the race law by protecting access to lineage documents in the church archive , " during hitler ’ s reign .
goldhagen gave the interview in advance of his new book the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair .
" the church and clergy in all of europe undisputedly carried out and supported crimes against jews , " goldhagen says in the interview .
germany ’ s cardinal karl lehmann rejected the accusations , saying the church helped protect 80 percent of the 900,000 jews that survived the holocaust .
he did regret that pope pius xii didn ’ t openly oppose the holocaust and admitted that an anti-semitic groundswell was still present in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's catholic church ambivalent about pedophilia priestly pedophilia isn ’ t a uniquely american phenomenon .
germany ’ s church has been struggling with the issue - reluctantly - for years .

he stands accused of the " gravest human rights violations " since wwii . slobodan milosevic faces the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia on friday in what is expected to be the weightiest part of his war crimes trial .
in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .
he has done it while at the same time refusing to recognize the tribunal as a legitimate judicial institution .
observers say the pressure is on the prosecution to do a better job of linking milosevic to atrocities with concrete evidence , something critics say un chief prosecutor carla del ponte failed to do during the first phase of the trial that ended four weeks ago .
" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .
he said each witness will shed " differing shafts of light " on milosevic 's responsibility for numerous crimes , including the massacre at the town of srebrenica that claimed 10,000 lives and the 46-week period where bosnian serbs laid siege to the city of sarajevo . he said the yugoslav army paid the bosnian serbs responsible for the siege of sarajevo even as milosevic publicly condemned it .
prosecutors also said serbian interior ministry police were involved in ethnic cleansing at srebrenica .
the attacks were part of a grander serb plan to carve out an ethnically-pure serbian state , said prosecutors , of which milosevic was involved .
" the systematic and organized way in which attacks against non-serb civilian populations in croatia were carried out revealed a carefully deisgned scheme and strategy within an overall plan that may be laid at the door of the accused , " nice said in opening statements .

at the conclusion of the meeting on thursday , the 68 bishops from dioceses all over the country came together under the chairmanship of cardinal lehmann and admitted for the first time to " often reacting inappropriately " in previous cases of sexual abuse in the church .
tougher action against paedophilic priests the bishops also decided to pursue a more intensive examination of accusations of sexual abuse in the church in the future .
this would involve appointing an external ombudsman in every diocese who would serve as a contact person for victims of sexual abuse as well as suspicious priests .
until now , each of germany ’ s 27 dioceses had its own method of dealing with the problem , which most often involved immediately suspending the priests and then transferring them out of their parishes .
in addition , the clerics also decided to initiate an internal inquiry in paedophilic cases before the criminal prosecution authorities intervened .
only once sexual abuse of children and youth were proved , would the guilty priest be advised to give himself up to police officials .
victims of sexual abuse will also be offered humanitarian , therapeutic and pastoral help in the future , and it will be mandatory for paedophilic priests to undergo therapy henceforth .
the bishops also did not rule out defrocking a guilty priest in certain serious cases .
paedophilia a sticky issue with church authorities but despite the wide-sweeping measures , the question of paedophilia still sits uneasily with the german catholic church as comments by cardinal lehmann in fulda showed .
on friday cardinal lehmann said that priests under suspicion of wrongdoing face intense public pressure to confess their deeds .
at the same time he said that hurling accusations of sexual abuse at priests had almost become common-place and an excuse to hit at priests .
he said the church reckoned with unending complaints against clerics in dioceses where they weren ’ t popular .
" suspicions are quickly formed , if one wants to get at a priest , " lehmann said .
these people -lrb- the priests -rrb- are then " destroyed " for life , he concluded .
another grey area for the catholic church in germany is the fact that the vatican in rome will have the final say in each case of sexual abuse .
according to the new resolutions , each serious case has to be referred to the vatican especially if suspicions against a priest are proved true .
lehmann made it clear that he expected dealing with directives from distant rome to be problematic .
" how that is actually going to work in reality is still not clear to me , " he said .
german catholic church hit by scandals following the paedophilia scandal in the united states involving more than a hundred priests last spring , the catholic church in germany too has come under intense pressure after it was hit by a string of scandals in recent months .
numerous cases of paedophilia concerning catholic priests have surfaced , including in cardinal lehmann ’ s own diocese in mainz .
the revelations have caused " massive damage " to the church , said lehmann during the opening of the conference .
church under fire for passive aid to nazis the four-day bishops conference this week has not just been under pressure to do more against paedophilic priests , but has also been grappling with allegations of providing passive aid to the nazis under hitler ’ s dictatorship .
in an interview with the german magazine stern this week , american author daniel goldhagen of the book hitler ’ s willing executioners , said the catholic church " actively and willingly helped to push the race law by protecting access to lineage documents in the church archive , " during hitler ’ s reign .
goldhagen gave the interview in advance of his new book the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair .
" the church and clergy in all of europe undisputedly carried out and supported crimes against jews , " goldhagen says in the interview .
germany ’ s cardinal karl lehmann rejected the accusations , saying the church helped protect 80 percent of the 900,000 jews that survived the holocaust .

this would involve appointing an external ombudsman in every diocese who would serve as a contact person for victims of sexual abuse as well as suspicious priests .
until now , each of germany ’ s 27 dioceses had its own method of dealing with the problem , which most often involved immediately suspending the priests and then transferring them out of their parishes .
in addition , the clerics also decided to initiate an internal inquiry in paedophilic cases before the criminal prosecution authorities intervened .
only once sexual abuse of children and youth were proved , would the guilty priest be advised to give himself up to police officials .
victims of sexual abuse will also be offered humanitarian , therapeutic and pastoral help in the future , and it will be mandatory for paedophilic priests to undergo therapy henceforth .
the bishops also did not rule out defrocking a guilty priest in certain serious cases .
paedophilia a sticky issue with church authorities but despite the wide-sweeping measures , the question of paedophilia still sits uneasily with the german catholic church as comments by cardinal lehmann in fulda showed .
on friday cardinal lehmann said that priests under suspicion of wrongdoing face intense public pressure to confess their deeds .
at the same time he said that hurling accusations of sexual abuse at priests had almost become common-place and an excuse to hit at priests .
he said the church reckoned with unending complaints against clerics in dioceses where they weren ’ t popular .
" suspicions are quickly formed , if one wants to get at a priest , " lehmann said .
these people -lrb- the priests -rrb- are then " destroyed " for life , he concluded .
another grey area for the catholic church in germany is the fact that the vatican in rome will have the final say in each case of sexual abuse .
according to the new resolutions , each serious case has to be referred to the vatican especially if suspicions against a priest are proved true .
lehmann made it clear that he expected dealing with directives from distant rome to be problematic .
" how that is actually going to work in reality is still not clear to me , " he said .
german catholic church hit by scandals following the paedophilia scandal in the united states involving more than a hundred priests last spring , the catholic church in germany too has come under intense pressure after it was hit by a string of scandals in recent months .
numerous cases of paedophilia concerning catholic priests have surfaced , including in cardinal lehmann ’ s own diocese in mainz .
the revelations have caused " massive damage " to the church , said lehmann during the opening of the conference .
church under fire for passive aid to nazis the four-day bishops conference this week has not just been under pressure to do more against paedophilic priests , but has also been grappling with allegations of providing passive aid to the nazis under hitler ’ s dictatorship .
in an interview with the german magazine stern this week , american author daniel goldhagen of the book hitler ’ s willing executioners , said the catholic church " actively and willingly helped to push the race law by protecting access to lineage documents in the church archive , " during hitler ’ s reign .
goldhagen gave the interview in advance of his new book the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair .
" the church and clergy in all of europe undisputedly carried out and supported crimes against jews , " goldhagen says in the interview .
germany ’ s cardinal karl lehmann rejected the accusations , saying the church helped protect 80 percent of the 900,000 jews that survived the holocaust .

the closure is part of a major drive to overhaul the structure of the stock exchange , create market transparency and boost investor confidence .
germany ’ s neuer markt , once touted as europe ’ s answer to the tech-heavy u.s. nasdaq , was launched in april 1997 as the leading european market for new economy issues .
young , growth-oriented companies from the fields of telecommunications , biotechnology and multi-media were listed in what was intended to be a fast-track path to high dividends .
short-lived dreams in the early days , when the high-tech and internet segment was mushrooming with new start-ups , the neuer markt grew rapidly , expanding from just two listings in the initial year to a record 133 at the market ’ s peak in 2000 .
at the time there was nothing like it in germany , and the neuer markt ’ s leading share index , the nemax50 , quickly reached all-time highs of 9,000 points .
an entire industry of market analysts , investment bankers , and financial consultants thrived in the off-shoots of the neuer markt .
it was trumpeted as the fast path to riches for small-time investors looking to dabble on the stock market .
and many readily accepted the market ’ s get-rich-quick promises as a financial mantra – that is until the new economy bubble burst and the market began to falter .
after a record spurt in early 2000 , interest in the high-tech and telecom sector quickly dried up .
over the last two years what little was left of investor confidence evaporated in the wake of a wave of corporate failures and financial scandals .
since the beginning of 2002 , more than 60 companies left the neuer markt .
on thursday the nemax50 was hovering at around 367 points .
" the neuer markt is not functioning any more ... the market segment for growth stocks is a farce , " said germany ’ s financial daily , handelsblatt .
" the move to shut it has been anticipated by many and is long overdue . "
new structures bring new hope deutsche börse launched a campaign to revive the neuer markt last year , vowing to keep the high-profile segment afloat .
at first it tried to restore investor confidence by kicking out so-called penny stocks and tightening up listing rules .
but when investors continued to stay away , the exchange was forced to take drastic steps .
wolfgang gerke , economics professor and an expert in banking and stock markets at the university of erlangen , told dw-radio that the deutsche börse was forced to do something and it did the right thing .
pulling the plug on the neuer markt was the only " logical step . "
now the börse is reorganizing trading on its exchanges by dividing the entire market into two new segments with different transparency standards , the domestic standard and prime standard .
the domestic standard segment will have minimum transparency requirements , and is primarily designed as a starting block for newer and smaller companies who are not quite ready to have all of their costs become public .
the prime standard will have increased transparency regulations along the lines of international requirements such as quarterly earnings reports , adherence to international accounting standards , presentation of a corporate calendar , at least one analysts ’ conference per year , " ad hoc " disclosure -lrb- company announcements issued through deutsche börse -rrb- , and ongoing reporting in english .
" the new segmentation is aimed at higher integrity and attractiveness of the capital market for investors and issuers .
investors can differentiate between the regulatory standards with which the companies have agree to comply , and issuers meet their individual financing needs , " the deutsche börse said on thursday .
but market experts warn not to expect too much too soon .

rival candidates vojislav kostunica and miroljub labus are expected to run head-to-head in second-round voting in two weeks time . the serbian people go to the polls this sunday to elect a new president .
opinion polls predict that current yugoslav president vojislav kostunica and yugoslav deputy prime minister miroljub labus will be the top two vote-getters in this first-round voting .
kostunica is expected to win in the second head-to-head runoff to be held two weeks later . the result of the election will have far-reaching consequences for continued economic and geo-political reforms taking place in serbia .
the current yugoslav federation , of which serbia is a part , is set to metamorphasise into a looser union , specified simply as montenegro and serbia . the post of serbian president will provide kostunica – whose opponents describe as the respectable face of hardline serbian nationalists – with the best chance of hanging on to power in the balkan region .
serbia is the largest state in the former yugoslavia . power struggle observers in the former yugloslavian state fear that victory for kostunica will result in an internal power stuggle between the serbian prime minister and the serbian president .
serbian prime minister zoran djindjic is backing labus . labus is a pro-market liberal and has been praised by western officials for introducing free-market reforms -lrb- together with djindjic -rrb- in serbia . kostunica - a 58-year-old law professor of the democratic party of serbia -lrb- dss -rrb- - describes himself as a moderate nationalist and argues that these reforms have been carried out badly and could cause future problems for the serbian economy . kostunica has said that establishing the democratic rule of law will be his top priority if he wins on sunday .
he also wants to oversee the creation of a new constitution and other laws to replace legislation dating from the authoritarian rule of slobodon milosevic .
“ mr. labus is fond of saying the economy is above everything .
for me , law is above everything … those are very serious and very principled differences between us , ” he told reuters news agency in an interview earlier this week .
kostunica has also fiercely criticised the u.n. war crimes tribunal , where milosevic is currently on trial .
kostunica accuses the tribunal of having an anti-serb bias .
he also caused outrage in ex-yugoslav bosnia when he declared at a campaign rally that serbia and bosnia were only “ temporarily separated ” .
the election campaign has been marred by growing racial tension in the state .
united nations police stopped ultra-nationalist leader vorjisla seselj from entering kosovo on thursday fearing his appearance at an election rally would stoke ethnic tensions .
un officials have discouraged serbian politicians from campaigning in the province , fearing outrage from the ethnic albanian majority who want complete independence for the region , placed under un control in 1999 .
the current serbian president , milan milutinovic , has already been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in the hague , and could be at risk of extradition once out of office at the end of the year . meanwhile on friday at the hague war crimes tribunal , milosevic faced the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia – the weightest section of the case against him . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aid for serbia ?

he stands accused of the " gravest human rights violations " since wwii . slobodan milosevic faces the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia on friday in what is expected to be the weightiest part of his war crimes trial .
in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .
he has done it while at the same time refusing to recognize the tribunal as a legitimate judicial institution .
observers say the pressure is on the prosecution to do a better job of linking milosevic to atrocities with concrete evidence , something critics say un chief prosecutor carla del ponte failed to do during the first phase of the trial that ended four weeks ago .
" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .
he said each witness will shed " differing shafts of light " on milosevic 's responsibility for numerous crimes , including the massacre at the town of srebrenica that claimed 10,000 lives and the 46-week period where bosnian serbs laid siege to the city of sarajevo . he said the yugoslav army paid the bosnian serbs responsible for the siege of sarajevo even as milosevic publicly condemned it .
prosecutors also said serbian interior ministry police were involved in ethnic cleansing at srebrenica .
the attacks were part of a grander serb plan to carve out an ethnically-pure serbian state , said prosecutors , of which milosevic was involved .
" the systematic and organized way in which attacks against non-serb civilian populations in croatia were carried out revealed a carefully deisgned scheme and strategy within an overall plan that may be laid at the door of the accused , " nice said in opening statements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 german bishops send tough message to paedophilic priests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karl lehmann -lrb- right -rrb- at the opening of the four-day conference catholic bishops in germany have adopted a series of tough resolutions to prevent child sex abuse in parishes and to restore the badly-shaken trust in the church . for the first time since the german catholic church was rocked by a series of paedophilia scandals , a four-day bishop ’ s conference in fulda has decided to get cracking on paedophilic priests .
at the conclusion of the meeting on thursday , the 68 bishops from dioceses all over the country came together under the chairmanship of cardinal lehmann and admitted for the first time to " often reacting inappropriately " in previous cases of sexual abuse in the church .
tougher action against paedophilic priests the bishops also decided to pursue a more intensive examination of accusations of sexual abuse in the church in the future .
this would involve appointing an external ombudsman in every diocese who would serve as a contact person for victims of sexual abuse as well as suspicious priests .
until now , each of germany ’ s 27 dioceses had its own method of dealing with the problem , which most often involved immediately suspending the priests and then transferring them out of their parishes .
in addition , the clerics also decided to initiate an internal inquiry in paedophilic cases before the criminal prosecution authorities intervened .
only once sexual abuse of children and youth were proved , would the guilty priest be advised to give himself up to police officials .
victims of sexual abuse will also be offered humanitarian , therapeutic and pastoral help in the future , and it will be mandatory for paedophilic priests to undergo therapy henceforth .
the bishops also did not rule out defrocking a guilty priest in certain serious cases .
paedophilia a sticky issue with church authorities but despite the wide-sweeping measures , the question of paedophilia still sits uneasily with the german catholic church as comments by cardinal lehmann in fulda showed .
on friday cardinal lehmann said that priests under suspicion of wrongdoing face intense public pressure to confess their deeds .
at the same time he said that hurling accusations of sexual abuse at priests had almost become common-place and an excuse to hit at priests .
he said the church reckoned with unending complaints against clerics in dioceses where they weren ’ t popular .
" suspicions are quickly formed , if one wants to get at a priest , " lehmann said .
these people -lrb- the priests -rrb- are then " destroyed " for life , he concluded .
another grey area for the catholic church in germany is the fact that the vatican in rome will have the final say in each case of sexual abuse .
according to the new resolutions , each serious case has to be referred to the vatican especially if suspicions against a priest are proved true .
lehmann made it clear that he expected dealing with directives from distant rome to be problematic .
" how that is actually going to work in reality is still not clear to me , " he said .
german catholic church hit by scandals following the paedophilia scandal in the united states involving more than a hundred priests last spring , the catholic church in germany too has come under intense pressure after it was hit by a string of scandals in recent months .
numerous cases of paedophilia concerning catholic priests have surfaced , including in cardinal lehmann ’ s own diocese in mainz .
the revelations have caused " massive damage " to the church , said lehmann during the opening of the conference .
church under fire for passive aid to nazis the four-day bishops conference this week has not just been under pressure to do more against paedophilic priests , but has also been grappling with allegations of providing passive aid to the nazis under hitler ’ s dictatorship .
in an interview with the german magazine stern this week , american author daniel goldhagen of the book hitler ’ s willing executioners , said the catholic church " actively and willingly helped to push the race law by protecting access to lineage documents in the church archive , " during hitler ’ s reign .
goldhagen gave the interview in advance of his new book the role of the catholic church in the holocaust and its unfulfilled duty of repair .
" the church and clergy in all of europe undisputedly carried out and supported crimes against jews , " goldhagen says in the interview .
germany ’ s cardinal karl lehmann rejected the accusations , saying the church helped protect 80 percent of the 900,000 jews that survived the holocaust .
he did regret that pope pius xii didn ’ t openly oppose the holocaust and admitted that an anti-semitic groundswell was still present in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's catholic church ambivalent about pedophilia priestly pedophilia isn ’ t a uniquely american phenomenon .
germany ’ s church has been struggling with the issue - reluctantly - for years .

he stands accused of the " gravest human rights violations " since wwii . slobodan milosevic faces the first prosecution witnesses on croatia and bosnia on friday in what is expected to be the weightiest part of his war crimes trial .
in opening statements on thursday of the second phase of milosevic 's trial , un prosecutors promised to connect the former yugoslav leader to the genocide of thousands of bosnians and croats during the early 1990s .
with the first phase of the trial , dealing with serbian atrocities in kosovo in 1999 behind him , milosevic faces allegations of the worst human rights violations since hitler .
prosecutor geoffrey nice took 80 minutes to read off the 61 counts of murder , torture and genocide on thursday at the war crimes tribunal in the hague , netherlands .
" these were the gravest violations of human rights in europe since the second world war , " he told the three-judge panel .
" slobodan milosevic is criminally responsible for these violations . "
milosevic , who is representing himself , maintained that he was working for peace in the region during the wars in bosnia and crotia from 1991 to 1995 .
he showed a documentary portraying the serb populations in croatia as victims of civil wars in the region . the 61-year-old former president has provided a furious and vigorous defense of his regime since his war crimes trial opened last february .
he has done it while at the same time refusing to recognize the tribunal as a legitimate judicial institution .
observers say the pressure is on the prosecution to do a better job of linking milosevic to atrocities with concrete evidence , something critics say un chief prosecutor carla del ponte failed to do during the first phase of the trial that ended four weeks ago .
" no smoking gun " just " shafts of light " but there will be no magic piece of evidence or " smoking gun " in the second trial , prosecutor nice told the judges .
he said each witness will shed " differing shafts of light " on milosevic 's responsibility for numerous crimes , including the massacre at the town of srebrenica that claimed 10,000 lives and the 46-week period where bosnian serbs laid siege to the city of sarajevo . he said the yugoslav army paid the bosnian serbs responsible for the siege of sarajevo even as milosevic publicly condemned it .
prosecutors also said serbian interior ministry police were involved in ethnic cleansing at srebrenica .
the attacks were part of a grander serb plan to carve out an ethnically-pure serbian state , said prosecutors , of which milosevic was involved .
" the systematic and organized way in which attacks against non-serb civilian populations in croatia were carried out revealed a carefully deisgned scheme and strategy within an overall plan that may be laid at the door of the accused , " nice said in opening statements .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 a shift in belief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people are looking for the answers at church .
when the twin towers collapsed last sept .
11 , many people asked themselves how god could allow such a thing to happen .
but have the terrorist attacks changed people ’ s relationship to religion and belief ? it has been a year since the terror attacks of sept .
11 shocked the world .
in germany , tens of thousands of people expressed their sympathy with the united states and the victims of the attacks .
the wave of emotions appeared endless : shock , anger , despair and frustration were overwhelming .
memorial services were packed and many people hoped to find solace and comfort in the country ’ s churches .
prelate dr. heiner koch from the cologne archbishopric says the services in the city 's cathedral were much better attended in the days following sept .
11 than ever before .
" i also noticed that people ’ s sensitivity was higher in this time , " he told deutsche welle .
" i held the high mass on the sunday directly after the attacks , where i addressed what happened .
and i have never gotten so much response to a sermon as i did then . "
but , koch adds , this short-term reaction can not be mistaken for a fundamental change in germany ’ s religious landscape .
" i don ’ t believe that . "
searching for answers of course , it is difficult - if not impossible - to back up the impressions of prelate koch and other religious groups in germany with concrete figures .
after all , no one has sat at the church ’ s door over the past year , counting the faithful as they pour in .
but one fact that has materialized is an increased interest in islam .
herder verlag , germany ’ s leading publisher of religious and theological books , says its books on islamic belief and tradition became bestsellers overnight .
herder also noticed a rise in sales for other spiritual literature , including books on meditation .
it appears that many people were searching for meaning not so much in the church , as within themselves .
robert doetsch , or swami ramateertha , is head of the osho uta center for spiritual therapy and meditation in cologne , one of the largest spiritual centers in europe .
he confirms this development .
" after the initial shock subsided , people started becoming alive again .
and then the real questions arise , like why am i here , what do i really want ? "
he says he found these issues became more pressing after september 11th , and that the sharpness of the situation has continued .
" it has become more particular that the ones who are looking for a different way are doing so more strongly . "
but , he adds , people who are looking for answers in old values are also doing so more intently .

11 : one year later terrorism fears a no show in german elections germany 's problems in outlawing islamic extremists fighting islamic extremism in german classrooms bringing 9/11 horror to berlin current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2002 a shift in belief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people are looking for the answers at church .
when the twin towers collapsed last sept .
11 , many people asked themselves how god could allow such a thing to happen .
but have the terrorist attacks changed people ’ s relationship to religion and belief ? it has been a year since the terror attacks of sept .
11 shocked the world .
in germany , tens of thousands of people expressed their sympathy with the united states and the victims of the attacks .
the wave of emotions appeared endless : shock , anger , despair and frustration were overwhelming .
memorial services were packed and many people hoped to find solace and comfort in the country ’ s churches .
prelate dr. heiner koch from the cologne archbishopric says the services in the city 's cathedral were much better attended in the days following sept .
11 than ever before .
" i also noticed that people ’ s sensitivity was higher in this time , " he told deutsche welle .
" i held the high mass on the sunday directly after the attacks , where i addressed what happened .
and i have never gotten so much response to a sermon as i did then . "
but , koch adds , this short-term reaction can not be mistaken for a fundamental change in germany ’ s religious landscape .
" i don ’ t believe that . "
searching for answers of course , it is difficult - if not impossible - to back up the impressions of prelate koch and other religious groups in germany with concrete figures .
after all , no one has sat at the church ’ s door over the past year , counting the faithful as they pour in .
but one fact that has materialized is an increased interest in islam .
herder verlag , germany ’ s leading publisher of religious and theological books , says its books on islamic belief and tradition became bestsellers overnight .
herder also noticed a rise in sales for other spiritual literature , including books on meditation .
it appears that many people were searching for meaning not so much in the church , as within themselves .
robert doetsch , or swami ramateertha , is head of the osho uta center for spiritual therapy and meditation in cologne , one of the largest spiritual centers in europe .
he confirms this development .
" after the initial shock subsided , people started becoming alive again .
and then the real questions arise , like why am i here , what do i really want ? "
he says he found these issues became more pressing after september 11th , and that the sharpness of the situation has continued .

mr annan called on israel to halt military action in densely-populated areas , and said he was deeply concerned about the possible consequences of the attack .
israeli security officials initially said they believed the missile attack on a car in gaza city had killed a senior figure in the militant palestinian group hamas , mohammed deif , although palestinian sources denied that he had died .
on friday , an israeli cabinet minister said he had received reports that mr deif had been injured but had not suffered a life-threatening injury .
" the secretary-general deplores the government of israel 's military action today in gaza city , " said his spokesman .
" he calls on the government of israel to halt such actions and conduct itself in a manner that is fully consistent with international humanitarian law . "
revenge call the two confirmed dead were both members of hamas .
israeli television reported that mr deif was killed , but hamas leaders insisted he was still alive .
he escaped a similar israeli attack last year , when he jumped out of a car seconds before it was struck by a missile .
witnesses said a car received two direct hits in the attack in a crowded area of gaza city .
according to hamas officials , an aide of mr deif , abdel-rahim hamdan , was killed along with a second as yet unidentified man .
hamas has vowed to step up suicide bombings inside israel to avenge the attack .
the strike occurred in the sheikh radwan neighbourhood - a hamas stronghold in the north of gaza city .
the bbc 's correspondent james rodgers says israeli helicopters were heard in the skies over gaza at around lunchtime .
" suddenly we heard the sound of a big explosion , " said mohammed hajar , a hairdresser working in the area .
" when i ran out , a second explosion took place . "
a large crowd gathered at the scene as rescue workers led the wounded to ambulances .
palestinian officials say several children were among the wounded .
the latest violence brings thursday 's death toll to seven .
earlier in the west bank , a 14-month-old palestinian baby died after inhaling tear gas fired by israeli soldiers enforcing a curfew in hebron .
the international red crescent organisation says this is thought to be the first time a child has died of tear gas inhalation during the current violence .
siege defended four other people died in clashes across the palestinian territories on thursday , including an israeli officer killed in a gun battle .
the army officer died near the northern west bank town of tulkarm in an exchange of fire in which a member of hamas was also killed .
also on thursday , prime minister ariel sharon defended israel 's siege of palestinian leader yasser arafat 's compound .
he said wanted men holed up inside the compound are " the biggest terrorists that exist " .
israeli forces invaded and started destroying the compound on 19 september following two suicide bomb attacks in two days .
