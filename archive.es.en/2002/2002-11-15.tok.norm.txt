the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame . an oil tanker that has been spilling its load into the sea off the coast of spain has sparked an international row surrounding accusations of who is to blame .
the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker registered in the bahamas , has already spilled many of the 77,000 tons of oil it was carrying when it got into trouble during vicious storms that have been battering spain and portugal for the past few days .
the tanker is said to have a crack in one of its oil tanks and has been emptying its contents into the atlantic ocean since wednesday evening .
" it looks as if one of the tanks has emptied itself ... they usually hold around 3,000 tons , " a spokesman at the emergency coordination center in la coruna told reuters on thursday .
it is estimated that the ship has lost half that amount from the holed tank .
emergency workers are still trying to get the stricken tanker away from the largely unspoiled northwest spanish coastline and avert an ecological disaster .
reports suggest an oil slick five miles long is trailing in the tanker 's wake , which was last reported to be listing at an angle of 50 degrees and in real danger of sinking .
rescue teams have managed to airlift 24 of the 27 crew off the prestige , leaving the captain and two other crew members to assist in salvage operations .
it is hoped that the tanker can be towed into deeper waters where , if it should sink , it would prove to be less of a threat to the galician coastline , an important fishing area .
eu blames britain and gibraltar for lack of inspection while efforts continue to stabilize the tanker , a storm of a different kind is brewing between the european union , britain and environmental groups as responsibility for the disaster gets passed from one to another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu blames a failure to inspect properly on the gibraltar authorities .
the eu is angry with britain and its mediterranean outpost gibraltar , claiming that proper checks were not carry out on the tanker when it docked at the rock before its latest journey from latvia .
the office of eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio , has sent british authorities a letter questioning whether it carried out the required inspections of the prestige .
palacio said , under new rules , port authorities had to check 25 percent of all ships coming into dock and added that such inspections should be especially targeted at ships with a history of problems .
he claims that the british authorities did not act under the new rules and as a consequence the tanker left gibraltar in an unsatisfactory state .
the spanish government has echoed the eu 's condemnation .
eu , spain have placed blamed too soon , says governor in response , the governor of gibraltar david durie criticized the eu and spain for holding the british colony responsible for the disaster .
" both the spanish government and the eu commission appear to have shot from the hip , " he told afp .
" shooting from the hip is not normally very accurate .
on this occasion they both appear to have shot themselves in the foot . "
in a statement released on thursday , the gibraltar government said that the prestige had visited the colony only once in the past four years and was not officially heading there on this trip .
environmentalists , who have warned that one of spain 's most scenic regions could face ecological catastrophe if the tanker continues to spill its cargo , have placed the blame on the eu 's doorstep .
greens pushed eu to take steps but with no action taken the prestige , an aging single-hulled 44,000-ton vessel , was built in japan in 1976 and last underwent inspection in 1999 .
environmentalists have long argued for stricter eu regulations demanding single-hulled vessels to be phased out and replaced with reinforced hulls of double thickness .
the eu has said that single-hulled tankers will be phased out completely by 2015 .
many green organizations believe that , together with the plan to implement a ban on tankers of the prestige 's type and age in 2005 , the eu actions will be too little too late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gibraltar pledges allegiance to the crown on thursday nearly 99 percent of gibraltarians said they did not want britain and spain to share sovereignty of their tiny territory . -lrb- 08/11/2002 -rrb- www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

the party 's honorary chairman otto graf lambsdorff said all party members who knew of or were involved in the controversial funding of an anti-israeli pamphlet distributed just before september 's election should be held responsible .
the leaflet was möllemann 's brainchild , but lambsdorff pointed out that the distribution of 8 million leaflets " can not be the work of a single person . "

-lrb- ap photo / frank augstein -rrb- that will be music to the ears of the beleaguered möllemann -lrb- pictured right -rrb- who is accused of using undeclared donations to the party to fund the controversial project .
the fdp 's treasurer , günter rexrodt , has said that a total of € 840,000 -lrb- $ 844,000 -rrb- in anonymous donations ranging from € 1,000 to € 8,000 was paid into an fdp-linked account .
the pamphlet in question featured a picture of israeli prime minister sharon , blasting him for sending tanks into palestinian refugee camps .
it also picked a fight with his long-time rival michel friedman , deputy leader of the council of jews in germany , whose intolerant and hateful behavior , möllemann said , were fostering anti-semitism .
feds launch official probe german prosecutors earlier this month opened a probe into möllemann , who until recently headed the fdp 's north rhine-westphalia branch , the biggest in germany .
he stepped down following questions over the source of the funds and now faces the threat of expulsion from the party .
however , the problems do not end there for the party , with further fdp politicians being sucked into the scandal .
the latest victim is wolfgang gerhardt , who currently heads the party 's parliamentary group .
during his tenure as party chairman in the late 1990s , the fdp parliamentary state and federal groups allegedly paid a number of large donations onto the party 's central accounts .
worried that the large amount of money would raise some eyebrows , gerhardt siphoned off around € 153,000 and returned it to the party as a temporary loan .
by doing so , observers say he violated party financing law , which explicitly forbids that money from the parliamentary group coffers be passed on to party accounts .
fighting talk meanwhile , in typically fighting fashion möllemann has said he will not go quietly .

political observers say that westerwelle covertly shares möllemann 's ideological views and his radical ideas for positioning the party better in the public eye .
however , some of those plans backfired in the pre-election period , most notably the campaign to obtain 18 percent of the vote as the fdp struggled to pick up a significantly lower 7.4 percent , effectively ruining its chances of forming a coalition government with the conservative christian democrats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.11.2002 black week for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least chancellor schröder can rely on one person to share a smile with .
the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .
the country 's business elite declared that over the next 12 months germany would become ever more unattractive to investors .
the government 's policies , they said uniformly , were ruinous .
popularity at record low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the titel of the book should be : the chancellor all at sea. although the original title , the chancellor lives in a swimming pool is also quite fitting.the subtitle , by the way , is intriguing : how politics work .
if schröder was expecting some sort of respite on friday , he was wrong .
the monthly politbarometer opinion poll found that the chancellor 's popularity in the eight weeks since re-election had plummeted to a record post-war low .
support for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped to 34 percent from the 38.5 percent it won in september .
the opposition , meanwhile , has jumped from 38.5 percent to 44 percent .
in another survey on the political mood in the country , the spd dropped to 26 percent , down 10 points from october and 20 from september .
asked why support for the government had fallen more dramatically than at any other time since world war ii , the spd 's general secretary olaf scholz said : " no one can expect applause to break out when a government has to make difficult decisions like this that cause pain . "
and it looks like the painful times for schröder have only just begun . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .
they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . -lrb- sept .
23 , 2002 -rrb- brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .
but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules .
-lrb- oct.18 , 2002 -rrb- eu commission fires warning shot at germany over budget the bombshell hit on wednesday : germany is practically on the brink of a deep recession .
non-existent growth , massive revenue shortfalls and eu disciplinary action all spell bad news for the sick man of europe .

the party 's honorary chairman otto graf lambsdorff said all party members who knew of or were involved in the controversial funding of an anti-israeli pamphlet distributed just before september 's election should be held responsible .
the leaflet was möllemann 's brainchild , but lambsdorff pointed out that the distribution of 8 million leaflets " can not be the work of a single person . "

-lrb- ap photo / frank augstein -rrb- that will be music to the ears of the beleaguered möllemann -lrb- pictured right -rrb- who is accused of using undeclared donations to the party to fund the controversial project .
the fdp 's treasurer , günter rexrodt , has said that a total of € 840,000 -lrb- $ 844,000 -rrb- in anonymous donations ranging from € 1,000 to € 8,000 was paid into an fdp-linked account .
the pamphlet in question featured a picture of israeli prime minister sharon , blasting him for sending tanks into palestinian refugee camps .
it also picked a fight with his long-time rival michel friedman , deputy leader of the council of jews in germany , whose intolerant and hateful behavior , möllemann said , were fostering anti-semitism .
feds launch official probe german prosecutors earlier this month opened a probe into möllemann , who until recently headed the fdp 's north rhine-westphalia branch , the biggest in germany .
he stepped down following questions over the source of the funds and now faces the threat of expulsion from the party .
however , the problems do not end there for the party , with further fdp politicians being sucked into the scandal .
the latest victim is wolfgang gerhardt , who currently heads the party 's parliamentary group .
during his tenure as party chairman in the late 1990s , the fdp parliamentary state and federal groups allegedly paid a number of large donations onto the party 's central accounts .
worried that the large amount of money would raise some eyebrows , gerhardt siphoned off around € 153,000 and returned it to the party as a temporary loan .
by doing so , observers say he violated party financing law , which explicitly forbids that money from the parliamentary group coffers be passed on to party accounts .

and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .

there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .

the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .

conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .

the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame . an oil tanker that has been spilling its load into the sea off the coast of spain has sparked an international row surrounding accusations of who is to blame .
the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker registered in the bahamas , has already spilled many of the 77,000 tons of oil it was carrying when it got into trouble during vicious storms that have been battering spain and portugal for the past few days .
the tanker is said to have a crack in one of its oil tanks and has been emptying its contents into the atlantic ocean since wednesday evening .
" it looks as if one of the tanks has emptied itself ... they usually hold around 3,000 tons , " a spokesman at the emergency coordination center in la coruna told reuters on thursday .
it is estimated that the ship has lost half that amount from the holed tank .
emergency workers are still trying to get the stricken tanker away from the largely unspoiled northwest spanish coastline and avert an ecological disaster .
reports suggest an oil slick five miles long is trailing in the tanker 's wake , which was last reported to be listing at an angle of 50 degrees and in real danger of sinking .
rescue teams have managed to airlift 24 of the 27 crew off the prestige , leaving the captain and two other crew members to assist in salvage operations .
it is hoped that the tanker can be towed into deeper waters where , if it should sink , it would prove to be less of a threat to the galician coastline , an important fishing area .
eu blames britain and gibraltar for lack of inspection while efforts continue to stabilize the tanker , a storm of a different kind is brewing between the european union , britain and environmental groups as responsibility for the disaster gets passed from one to another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu blames a failure to inspect properly on the gibraltar authorities .
the eu is angry with britain and its mediterranean outpost gibraltar , claiming that proper checks were not carry out on the tanker when it docked at the rock before its latest journey from latvia .
the office of eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio , has sent british authorities a letter questioning whether it carried out the required inspections of the prestige .
palacio said , under new rules , port authorities had to check 25 percent of all ships coming into dock and added that such inspections should be especially targeted at ships with a history of problems .
he claims that the british authorities did not act under the new rules and as a consequence the tanker left gibraltar in an unsatisfactory state .
the spanish government has echoed the eu 's condemnation .
eu , spain have placed blamed too soon , says governor in response , the governor of gibraltar david durie criticized the eu and spain for holding the british colony responsible for the disaster .
" both the spanish government and the eu commission appear to have shot from the hip , " he told afp .
" shooting from the hip is not normally very accurate .
on this occasion they both appear to have shot themselves in the foot . "
in a statement released on thursday , the gibraltar government said that the prestige had visited the colony only once in the past four years and was not officially heading there on this trip .
environmentalists , who have warned that one of spain 's most scenic regions could face ecological catastrophe if the tanker continues to spill its cargo , have placed the blame on the eu 's doorstep .
greens pushed eu to take steps but with no action taken the prestige , an aging single-hulled 44,000-ton vessel , was built in japan in 1976 and last underwent inspection in 1999 .
environmentalists have long argued for stricter eu regulations demanding single-hulled vessels to be phased out and replaced with reinforced hulls of double thickness .
the eu has said that single-hulled tankers will be phased out completely by 2015 .
many green organizations believe that , together with the plan to implement a ban on tankers of the prestige 's type and age in 2005 , the eu actions will be too little too late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gibraltar pledges allegiance to the crown on thursday nearly 99 percent of gibraltarians said they did not want britain and spain to share sovereignty of their tiny territory . -lrb- 08/11/2002 -rrb- www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame . an oil tanker that has been spilling its load into the sea off the coast of spain has sparked an international row surrounding accusations of who is to blame .
the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker registered in the bahamas , has already spilled many of the 77,000 tons of oil it was carrying when it got into trouble during vicious storms that have been battering spain and portugal for the past few days .
the tanker is said to have a crack in one of its oil tanks and has been emptying its contents into the atlantic ocean since wednesday evening .
" it looks as if one of the tanks has emptied itself ... they usually hold around 3,000 tons , " a spokesman at the emergency coordination center in la coruna told reuters on thursday .
it is estimated that the ship has lost half that amount from the holed tank .
emergency workers are still trying to get the stricken tanker away from the largely unspoiled northwest spanish coastline and avert an ecological disaster .
reports suggest an oil slick five miles long is trailing in the tanker 's wake , which was last reported to be listing at an angle of 50 degrees and in real danger of sinking .
rescue teams have managed to airlift 24 of the 27 crew off the prestige , leaving the captain and two other crew members to assist in salvage operations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.11.2002 black week for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least chancellor schröder can rely on one person to share a smile with .
the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .
the country 's business elite declared that over the next 12 months germany would become ever more unattractive to investors .
the government 's policies , they said uniformly , were ruinous .
popularity at record low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the titel of the book should be : the chancellor all at sea. although the original title , the chancellor lives in a swimming pool is also quite fitting.the subtitle , by the way , is intriguing : how politics work .
if schröder was expecting some sort of respite on friday , he was wrong .

the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .
the country 's business elite declared that over the next 12 months germany would become ever more unattractive to investors .
the government 's policies , they said uniformly , were ruinous .

the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .
the country 's business elite declared that over the next 12 months germany would become ever more unattractive to investors .
the government 's policies , they said uniformly , were ruinous .
popularity at record low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the titel of the book should be : the chancellor all at sea. although the original title , the chancellor lives in a swimming pool is also quite fitting.the subtitle , by the way , is intriguing : how politics work .
if schröder was expecting some sort of respite on friday , he was wrong .
the monthly politbarometer opinion poll found that the chancellor 's popularity in the eight weeks since re-election had plummeted to a record post-war low .
support for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped to 34 percent from the 38.5 percent it won in september .
the opposition , meanwhile , has jumped from 38.5 percent to 44 percent .
in another survey on the political mood in the country , the spd dropped to 26 percent , down 10 points from october and 20 from september .
asked why support for the government had fallen more dramatically than at any other time since world war ii , the spd 's general secretary olaf scholz said : " no one can expect applause to break out when a government has to make difficult decisions like this that cause pain . "
and it looks like the painful times for schröder have only just begun . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .

the party 's honorary chairman otto graf lambsdorff said all party members who knew of or were involved in the controversial funding of an anti-israeli pamphlet distributed just before september 's election should be held responsible .
the leaflet was möllemann 's brainchild , but lambsdorff pointed out that the distribution of 8 million leaflets " can not be the work of a single person . "
illegal donations into account bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chairman guido westerwelle enters the podium at the fdp headquarters in berlin , sunday sept .

-lrb- ap photo / frank augstein -rrb- that will be music to the ears of the beleaguered möllemann -lrb- pictured right -rrb- who is accused of using undeclared donations to the party to fund the controversial project .
the fdp 's treasurer , günter rexrodt , has said that a total of € 840,000 -lrb- $ 844,000 -rrb- in anonymous donations ranging from € 1,000 to € 8,000 was paid into an fdp-linked account .
the pamphlet in question featured a picture of israeli prime minister sharon , blasting him for sending tanks into palestinian refugee camps .
it also picked a fight with his long-time rival michel friedman , deputy leader of the council of jews in germany , whose intolerant and hateful behavior , möllemann said , were fostering anti-semitism .
feds launch official probe german prosecutors earlier this month opened a probe into möllemann , who until recently headed the fdp 's north rhine-westphalia branch , the biggest in germany .
he stepped down following questions over the source of the funds and now faces the threat of expulsion from the party .
however , the problems do not end there for the party , with further fdp politicians being sucked into the scandal .
the latest victim is wolfgang gerhardt , who currently heads the party 's parliamentary group .
during his tenure as party chairman in the late 1990s , the fdp parliamentary state and federal groups allegedly paid a number of large donations onto the party 's central accounts .
worried that the large amount of money would raise some eyebrows , gerhardt siphoned off around € 153,000 and returned it to the party as a temporary loan .
by doing so , observers say he violated party financing law , which explicitly forbids that money from the parliamentary group coffers be passed on to party accounts .
fighting talk meanwhile , in typically fighting fashion möllemann has said he will not go quietly .

the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame . an oil tanker that has been spilling its load into the sea off the coast of spain has sparked an international row surrounding accusations of who is to blame .
the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker registered in the bahamas , has already spilled many of the 77,000 tons of oil it was carrying when it got into trouble during vicious storms that have been battering spain and portugal for the past few days .
the tanker is said to have a crack in one of its oil tanks and has been emptying its contents into the atlantic ocean since wednesday evening .
" it looks as if one of the tanks has emptied itself ... they usually hold around 3,000 tons , " a spokesman at the emergency coordination center in la coruna told reuters on thursday .
it is estimated that the ship has lost half that amount from the holed tank .
emergency workers are still trying to get the stricken tanker away from the largely unspoiled northwest spanish coastline and avert an ecological disaster .
reports suggest an oil slick five miles long is trailing in the tanker 's wake , which was last reported to be listing at an angle of 50 degrees and in real danger of sinking .
rescue teams have managed to airlift 24 of the 27 crew off the prestige , leaving the captain and two other crew members to assist in salvage operations .
it is hoped that the tanker can be towed into deeper waters where , if it should sink , it would prove to be less of a threat to the galician coastline , an important fishing area .
eu blames britain and gibraltar for lack of inspection while efforts continue to stabilize the tanker , a storm of a different kind is brewing between the european union , britain and environmental groups as responsibility for the disaster gets passed from one to another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu blames a failure to inspect properly on the gibraltar authorities .
the eu is angry with britain and its mediterranean outpost gibraltar , claiming that proper checks were not carry out on the tanker when it docked at the rock before its latest journey from latvia .
the office of eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio , has sent british authorities a letter questioning whether it carried out the required inspections of the prestige .
palacio said , under new rules , port authorities had to check 25 percent of all ships coming into dock and added that such inspections should be especially targeted at ships with a history of problems .
he claims that the british authorities did not act under the new rules and as a consequence the tanker left gibraltar in an unsatisfactory state .
the spanish government has echoed the eu 's condemnation .
eu , spain have placed blamed too soon , says governor in response , the governor of gibraltar david durie criticized the eu and spain for holding the british colony responsible for the disaster .
" both the spanish government and the eu commission appear to have shot from the hip , " he told afp .
" shooting from the hip is not normally very accurate .
on this occasion they both appear to have shot themselves in the foot . "
in a statement released on thursday , the gibraltar government said that the prestige had visited the colony only once in the past four years and was not officially heading there on this trip .
environmentalists , who have warned that one of spain 's most scenic regions could face ecological catastrophe if the tanker continues to spill its cargo , have placed the blame on the eu 's doorstep .
greens pushed eu to take steps but with no action taken the prestige , an aging single-hulled 44,000-ton vessel , was built in japan in 1976 and last underwent inspection in 1999 .
environmentalists have long argued for stricter eu regulations demanding single-hulled vessels to be phased out and replaced with reinforced hulls of double thickness .
the eu has said that single-hulled tankers will be phased out completely by 2015 .
many green organizations believe that , together with the plan to implement a ban on tankers of the prestige 's type and age in 2005 , the eu actions will be too little too late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gibraltar pledges allegiance to the crown on thursday nearly 99 percent of gibraltarians said they did not want britain and spain to share sovereignty of their tiny territory . -lrb- 08/11/2002 -rrb- www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.11.2002 black week for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least chancellor schröder can rely on one person to share a smile with .
the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .
the country 's business elite declared that over the next 12 months germany would become ever more unattractive to investors .
the government 's policies , they said uniformly , were ruinous .
popularity at record low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the titel of the book should be : the chancellor all at sea. although the original title , the chancellor lives in a swimming pool is also quite fitting.the subtitle , by the way , is intriguing : how politics work .
if schröder was expecting some sort of respite on friday , he was wrong .
the monthly politbarometer opinion poll found that the chancellor 's popularity in the eight weeks since re-election had plummeted to a record post-war low .
support for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped to 34 percent from the 38.5 percent it won in september .
the opposition , meanwhile , has jumped from 38.5 percent to 44 percent .
in another survey on the political mood in the country , the spd dropped to 26 percent , down 10 points from october and 20 from september .
asked why support for the government had fallen more dramatically than at any other time since world war ii , the spd 's general secretary olaf scholz said : " no one can expect applause to break out when a government has to make difficult decisions like this that cause pain . "
and it looks like the painful times for schröder have only just begun . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .

23 , 2002 -rrb- brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .

the party 's honorary chairman otto graf lambsdorff said all party members who knew of or were involved in the controversial funding of an anti-israeli pamphlet distributed just before september 's election should be held responsible .
the leaflet was möllemann 's brainchild , but lambsdorff pointed out that the distribution of 8 million leaflets " can not be the work of a single person . "

the fdp 's treasurer , günter rexrodt , has said that a total of € 840,000 -lrb- $ 844,000 -rrb- in anonymous donations ranging from € 1,000 to € 8,000 was paid into an fdp-linked account .
the pamphlet in question featured a picture of israeli prime minister sharon , blasting him for sending tanks into palestinian refugee camps .
it also picked a fight with his long-time rival michel friedman , deputy leader of the council of jews in germany , whose intolerant and hateful behavior , möllemann said , were fostering anti-semitism .
feds launch official probe german prosecutors earlier this month opened a probe into möllemann , who until recently headed the fdp 's north rhine-westphalia branch , the biggest in germany .
he stepped down following questions over the source of the funds and now faces the threat of expulsion from the party .
however , the problems do not end there for the party , with further fdp politicians being sucked into the scandal .
the latest victim is wolfgang gerhardt , who currently heads the party 's parliamentary group .
during his tenure as party chairman in the late 1990s , the fdp parliamentary state and federal groups allegedly paid a number of large donations onto the party 's central accounts .
worried that the large amount of money would raise some eyebrows , gerhardt siphoned off around € 153,000 and returned it to the party as a temporary loan .
by doing so , observers say he violated party financing law , which explicitly forbids that money from the parliamentary group coffers be passed on to party accounts .
fighting talk meanwhile , in typically fighting fashion möllemann has said he will not go quietly .

the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame . an oil tanker that has been spilling its load into the sea off the coast of spain has sparked an international row surrounding accusations of who is to blame .
the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker registered in the bahamas , has already spilled many of the 77,000 tons of oil it was carrying when it got into trouble during vicious storms that have been battering spain and portugal for the past few days .
the tanker is said to have a crack in one of its oil tanks and has been emptying its contents into the atlantic ocean since wednesday evening .
" it looks as if one of the tanks has emptied itself ... they usually hold around 3,000 tons , " a spokesman at the emergency coordination center in la coruna told reuters on thursday .
it is estimated that the ship has lost half that amount from the holed tank .
emergency workers are still trying to get the stricken tanker away from the largely unspoiled northwest spanish coastline and avert an ecological disaster .
reports suggest an oil slick five miles long is trailing in the tanker 's wake , which was last reported to be listing at an angle of 50 degrees and in real danger of sinking .
rescue teams have managed to airlift 24 of the 27 crew off the prestige , leaving the captain and two other crew members to assist in salvage operations .
it is hoped that the tanker can be towed into deeper waters where , if it should sink , it would prove to be less of a threat to the galician coastline , an important fishing area .
eu blames britain and gibraltar for lack of inspection while efforts continue to stabilize the tanker , a storm of a different kind is brewing between the european union , britain and environmental groups as responsibility for the disaster gets passed from one to another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu blames a failure to inspect properly on the gibraltar authorities .
the eu is angry with britain and its mediterranean outpost gibraltar , claiming that proper checks were not carry out on the tanker when it docked at the rock before its latest journey from latvia .
the office of eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio , has sent british authorities a letter questioning whether it carried out the required inspections of the prestige .
palacio said , under new rules , port authorities had to check 25 percent of all ships coming into dock and added that such inspections should be especially targeted at ships with a history of problems .
he claims that the british authorities did not act under the new rules and as a consequence the tanker left gibraltar in an unsatisfactory state .
the spanish government has echoed the eu 's condemnation .
eu , spain have placed blamed too soon , says governor in response , the governor of gibraltar david durie criticized the eu and spain for holding the british colony responsible for the disaster .
" both the spanish government and the eu commission appear to have shot from the hip , " he told afp .
" shooting from the hip is not normally very accurate .
on this occasion they both appear to have shot themselves in the foot . "
in a statement released on thursday , the gibraltar government said that the prestige had visited the colony only once in the past four years and was not officially heading there on this trip .
environmentalists , who have warned that one of spain 's most scenic regions could face ecological catastrophe if the tanker continues to spill its cargo , have placed the blame on the eu 's doorstep .
greens pushed eu to take steps but with no action taken the prestige , an aging single-hulled 44,000-ton vessel , was built in japan in 1976 and last underwent inspection in 1999 .
environmentalists have long argued for stricter eu regulations demanding single-hulled vessels to be phased out and replaced with reinforced hulls of double thickness .
the eu has said that single-hulled tankers will be phased out completely by 2015 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.11.2002 black week for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least chancellor schröder can rely on one person to share a smile with .
the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .
the country 's business elite declared that over the next 12 months germany would become ever more unattractive to investors .
the government 's policies , they said uniformly , were ruinous .
popularity at record low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the titel of the book should be : the chancellor all at sea. although the original title , the chancellor lives in a swimming pool is also quite fitting.the subtitle , by the way , is intriguing : how politics work .
if schröder was expecting some sort of respite on friday , he was wrong .
the monthly politbarometer opinion poll found that the chancellor 's popularity in the eight weeks since re-election had plummeted to a record post-war low .
support for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped to 34 percent from the 38.5 percent it won in september .
the opposition , meanwhile , has jumped from 38.5 percent to 44 percent .
in another survey on the political mood in the country , the spd dropped to 26 percent , down 10 points from october and 20 from september .
asked why support for the government had fallen more dramatically than at any other time since world war ii , the spd 's general secretary olaf scholz said : " no one can expect applause to break out when a government has to make difficult decisions like this that cause pain . "
and it looks like the painful times for schröder have only just begun . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .

the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .

if schröder was expecting some sort of respite on friday , he was wrong .
the monthly politbarometer opinion poll found that the chancellor 's popularity in the eight weeks since re-election had plummeted to a record post-war low .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 15.11.2002 oil continues to spill as blame is passed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as the prestige threatens to sink , the question circulates - who 's to blame ?
the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame . an oil tanker that has been spilling its load into the sea off the coast of spain has sparked an international row surrounding accusations of who is to blame .
the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker registered in the bahamas , has already spilled many of the 77,000 tons of oil it was carrying when it got into trouble during vicious storms that have been battering spain and portugal for the past few days .
the tanker is said to have a crack in one of its oil tanks and has been emptying its contents into the atlantic ocean since wednesday evening .
" it looks as if one of the tanks has emptied itself ... they usually hold around 3,000 tons , " a spokesman at the emergency coordination center in la coruna told reuters on thursday .
it is estimated that the ship has lost half that amount from the holed tank .
emergency workers are still trying to get the stricken tanker away from the largely unspoiled northwest spanish coastline and avert an ecological disaster .
reports suggest an oil slick five miles long is trailing in the tanker 's wake , which was last reported to be listing at an angle of 50 degrees and in real danger of sinking .
rescue teams have managed to airlift 24 of the 27 crew off the prestige , leaving the captain and two other crew members to assist in salvage operations .
it is hoped that the tanker can be towed into deeper waters where , if it should sink , it would prove to be less of a threat to the galician coastline , an important fishing area .
eu blames britain and gibraltar for lack of inspection while efforts continue to stabilize the tanker , a storm of a different kind is brewing between the european union , britain and environmental groups as responsibility for the disaster gets passed from one to another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu blames a failure to inspect properly on the gibraltar authorities .
the eu is angry with britain and its mediterranean outpost gibraltar , claiming that proper checks were not carry out on the tanker when it docked at the rock before its latest journey from latvia .
the office of eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio , has sent british authorities a letter questioning whether it carried out the required inspections of the prestige .
palacio said , under new rules , port authorities had to check 25 percent of all ships coming into dock and added that such inspections should be especially targeted at ships with a history of problems .
he claims that the british authorities did not act under the new rules and as a consequence the tanker left gibraltar in an unsatisfactory state .
the spanish government has echoed the eu 's condemnation .
eu , spain have placed blamed too soon , says governor in response , the governor of gibraltar david durie criticized the eu and spain for holding the british colony responsible for the disaster .
" both the spanish government and the eu commission appear to have shot from the hip , " he told afp .
" shooting from the hip is not normally very accurate .

in a statement released on thursday , the gibraltar government said that the prestige had visited the colony only once in the past four years and was not officially heading there on this trip .
environmentalists , who have warned that one of spain 's most scenic regions could face ecological catastrophe if the tanker continues to spill its cargo , have placed the blame on the eu 's doorstep .
greens pushed eu to take steps but with no action taken the prestige , an aging single-hulled 44,000-ton vessel , was built in japan in 1976 and last underwent inspection in 1999 .
environmentalists have long argued for stricter eu regulations demanding single-hulled vessels to be phased out and replaced with reinforced hulls of double thickness .
the eu has said that single-hulled tankers will be phased out completely by 2015 .
many green organizations believe that , together with the plan to implement a ban on tankers of the prestige 's type and age in 2005 , the eu actions will be too little too late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gibraltar pledges allegiance to the crown on thursday nearly 99 percent of gibraltarians said they did not want britain and spain to share sovereignty of their tiny territory . -lrb- 08/11/2002 -rrb- www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.11.2002 fdp in state of paralysis over undeclared donations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an fdp campaign ploy during happier times germany 's liberal party is stumbling around trying desperately to find a way out of the quagmire of illegal donations and accusations that have reached party leadership and plunged its popularity among voters . jürgen w. möllemann , the charismatic nightmare to his own party , germany 's free democrats , received support from an unexpected quarter on thursday .
the party 's honorary chairman otto graf lambsdorff said all party members who knew of or were involved in the controversial funding of an anti-israeli pamphlet distributed just before september 's election should be held responsible .
the leaflet was möllemann 's brainchild , but lambsdorff pointed out that the distribution of 8 million leaflets " can not be the work of a single person . "
illegal donations into account bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chairman guido westerwelle enters the podium at the fdp headquarters in berlin , sunday sept .
22 , 2002 .
the liberals fell short of reaching their goal of 18 percent , scoring just slightly above seven percent .
-lrb- ap photo / frank augstein -rrb- that will be music to the ears of the beleaguered möllemann -lrb- pictured right -rrb- who is accused of using undeclared donations to the party to fund the controversial project .
the fdp 's treasurer , günter rexrodt , has said that a total of € 840,000 -lrb- $ 844,000 -rrb- in anonymous donations ranging from € 1,000 to € 8,000 was paid into an fdp-linked account .
the pamphlet in question featured a picture of israeli prime minister sharon , blasting him for sending tanks into palestinian refugee camps .
it also picked a fight with his long-time rival michel friedman , deputy leader of the council of jews in germany , whose intolerant and hateful behavior , möllemann said , were fostering anti-semitism .
feds launch official probe german prosecutors earlier this month opened a probe into möllemann , who until recently headed the fdp 's north rhine-westphalia branch , the biggest in germany .
he stepped down following questions over the source of the funds and now faces the threat of expulsion from the party .
however , the problems do not end there for the party , with further fdp politicians being sucked into the scandal .
the latest victim is wolfgang gerhardt , who currently heads the party 's parliamentary group .
during his tenure as party chairman in the late 1990s , the fdp parliamentary state and federal groups allegedly paid a number of large donations onto the party 's central accounts .
worried that the large amount of money would raise some eyebrows , gerhardt siphoned off around € 153,000 and returned it to the party as a temporary loan .
by doing so , observers say he violated party financing law , which explicitly forbids that money from the parliamentary group coffers be passed on to party accounts .
fighting talk meanwhile , in typically fighting fashion möllemann has said he will not go quietly .

mai 2002 waehrend einer pressekonferenz in duesseldorf .
moellemann hat am sonntag , 20 .
oktober 2002 seinen sofortigen ruecktritt sowohl als nrw fdp landeschef als auch als nrw fdp fraktionsvorsitzender erklaert his remarks are seen as a swipe at the youthful party leader guido westerwelle -lrb- pictured left -rrb- , who is attempting to remain above the fray .
political observers say that westerwelle covertly shares möllemann 's ideological views and his radical ideas for positioning the party better in the public eye .
however , some of those plans backfired in the pre-election period , most notably the campaign to obtain 18 percent of the vote as the fdp struggled to pick up a significantly lower 7.4 percent , effectively ruining its chances of forming a coalition government with the conservative christian democrats .
and there was more bad news for the party on thursday with the release of a poll that showed the fdp just barely scraping past the 5 percent barrier needed to enter parliament if the election were held this sunday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troublemaker möllemann steps down from throne the controversial german free democrat jürgen möllemann resigned as regional party leader of north-rhine westphalia in response to allegations that he used illegal donations to finance a brochure critical of israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.11.2002 black week for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least chancellor schröder can rely on one person to share a smile with .
the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .
the country 's business elite declared that over the next 12 months germany would become ever more unattractive to investors .
the government 's policies , they said uniformly , were ruinous .
popularity at record low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the titel of the book should be : the chancellor all at sea. although the original title , the chancellor lives in a swimming pool is also quite fitting.the subtitle , by the way , is intriguing : how politics work .
if schröder was expecting some sort of respite on friday , he was wrong .
the monthly politbarometer opinion poll found that the chancellor 's popularity in the eight weeks since re-election had plummeted to a record post-war low .
support for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped to 34 percent from the 38.5 percent it won in september .
the opposition , meanwhile , has jumped from 38.5 percent to 44 percent .
in another survey on the political mood in the country , the spd dropped to 26 percent , down 10 points from october and 20 from september .
asked why support for the government had fallen more dramatically than at any other time since world war ii , the spd 's general secretary olaf scholz said : " no one can expect applause to break out when a government has to make difficult decisions like this that cause pain . "
and it looks like the painful times for schröder have only just begun . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .

the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame . an oil tanker that has been spilling its load into the sea off the coast of spain has sparked an international row surrounding accusations of who is to blame .
the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker registered in the bahamas , has already spilled many of the 77,000 tons of oil it was carrying when it got into trouble during vicious storms that have been battering spain and portugal for the past few days .
the tanker is said to have a crack in one of its oil tanks and has been emptying its contents into the atlantic ocean since wednesday evening .
" it looks as if one of the tanks has emptied itself ... they usually hold around 3,000 tons , " a spokesman at the emergency coordination center in la coruna told reuters on thursday .
it is estimated that the ship has lost half that amount from the holed tank .
emergency workers are still trying to get the stricken tanker away from the largely unspoiled northwest spanish coastline and avert an ecological disaster .
reports suggest an oil slick five miles long is trailing in the tanker 's wake , which was last reported to be listing at an angle of 50 degrees and in real danger of sinking .
rescue teams have managed to airlift 24 of the 27 crew off the prestige , leaving the captain and two other crew members to assist in salvage operations .
it is hoped that the tanker can be towed into deeper waters where , if it should sink , it would prove to be less of a threat to the galician coastline , an important fishing area .
eu blames britain and gibraltar for lack of inspection while efforts continue to stabilize the tanker , a storm of a different kind is brewing between the european union , britain and environmental groups as responsibility for the disaster gets passed from one to another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu blames a failure to inspect properly on the gibraltar authorities .
the eu is angry with britain and its mediterranean outpost gibraltar , claiming that proper checks were not carry out on the tanker when it docked at the rock before its latest journey from latvia .
the office of eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio , has sent british authorities a letter questioning whether it carried out the required inspections of the prestige .
palacio said , under new rules , port authorities had to check 25 percent of all ships coming into dock and added that such inspections should be especially targeted at ships with a history of problems .
he claims that the british authorities did not act under the new rules and as a consequence the tanker left gibraltar in an unsatisfactory state .
the spanish government has echoed the eu 's condemnation .
eu , spain have placed blamed too soon , says governor in response , the governor of gibraltar david durie criticized the eu and spain for holding the british colony responsible for the disaster .
" both the spanish government and the eu commission appear to have shot from the hip , " he told afp .
" shooting from the hip is not normally very accurate .
on this occasion they both appear to have shot themselves in the foot . "
in a statement released on thursday , the gibraltar government said that the prestige had visited the colony only once in the past four years and was not officially heading there on this trip .
environmentalists , who have warned that one of spain 's most scenic regions could face ecological catastrophe if the tanker continues to spill its cargo , have placed the blame on the eu 's doorstep .
greens pushed eu to take steps but with no action taken the prestige , an aging single-hulled 44,000-ton vessel , was built in japan in 1976 and last underwent inspection in 1999 .
environmentalists have long argued for stricter eu regulations demanding single-hulled vessels to be phased out and replaced with reinforced hulls of double thickness .
the eu has said that single-hulled tankers will be phased out completely by 2015 .
many green organizations believe that , together with the plan to implement a ban on tankers of the prestige 's type and age in 2005 , the eu actions will be too little too late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gibraltar pledges allegiance to the crown on thursday nearly 99 percent of gibraltarians said they did not want britain and spain to share sovereignty of their tiny territory . -lrb- 08/11/2002 -rrb- www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame . an oil tanker that has been spilling its load into the sea off the coast of spain has sparked an international row surrounding accusations of who is to blame .
the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker registered in the bahamas , has already spilled many of the 77,000 tons of oil it was carrying when it got into trouble during vicious storms that have been battering spain and portugal for the past few days .
the tanker is said to have a crack in one of its oil tanks and has been emptying its contents into the atlantic ocean since wednesday evening .
" it looks as if one of the tanks has emptied itself ... they usually hold around 3,000 tons , " a spokesman at the emergency coordination center in la coruna told reuters on thursday .
it is estimated that the ship has lost half that amount from the holed tank .
emergency workers are still trying to get the stricken tanker away from the largely unspoiled northwest spanish coastline and avert an ecological disaster .
reports suggest an oil slick five miles long is trailing in the tanker 's wake , which was last reported to be listing at an angle of 50 degrees and in real danger of sinking .
rescue teams have managed to airlift 24 of the 27 crew off the prestige , leaving the captain and two other crew members to assist in salvage operations .
it is hoped that the tanker can be towed into deeper waters where , if it should sink , it would prove to be less of a threat to the galician coastline , an important fishing area .
eu blames britain and gibraltar for lack of inspection while efforts continue to stabilize the tanker , a storm of a different kind is brewing between the european union , britain and environmental groups as responsibility for the disaster gets passed from one to another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu blames a failure to inspect properly on the gibraltar authorities .
the eu is angry with britain and its mediterranean outpost gibraltar , claiming that proper checks were not carry out on the tanker when it docked at the rock before its latest journey from latvia .
the office of eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio , has sent british authorities a letter questioning whether it carried out the required inspections of the prestige .
palacio said , under new rules , port authorities had to check 25 percent of all ships coming into dock and added that such inspections should be especially targeted at ships with a history of problems .
he claims that the british authorities did not act under the new rules and as a consequence the tanker left gibraltar in an unsatisfactory state .
the spanish government has echoed the eu 's condemnation .
eu , spain have placed blamed too soon , says governor in response , the governor of gibraltar david durie criticized the eu and spain for holding the british colony responsible for the disaster .
" both the spanish government and the eu commission appear to have shot from the hip , " he told afp .
" shooting from the hip is not normally very accurate .
on this occasion they both appear to have shot themselves in the foot . "
in a statement released on thursday , the gibraltar government said that the prestige had visited the colony only once in the past four years and was not officially heading there on this trip .
environmentalists , who have warned that one of spain 's most scenic regions could face ecological catastrophe if the tanker continues to spill its cargo , have placed the blame on the eu 's doorstep .
greens pushed eu to take steps but with no action taken the prestige , an aging single-hulled 44,000-ton vessel , was built in japan in 1976 and last underwent inspection in 1999 .
environmentalists have long argued for stricter eu regulations demanding single-hulled vessels to be phased out and replaced with reinforced hulls of double thickness .
the eu has said that single-hulled tankers will be phased out completely by 2015 .
many green organizations believe that , together with the plan to implement a ban on tankers of the prestige 's type and age in 2005 , the eu actions will be too little too late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gibraltar pledges allegiance to the crown on thursday nearly 99 percent of gibraltarians said they did not want britain and spain to share sovereignty of their tiny territory . -lrb- 08/11/2002 -rrb- www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.11.2002 black week for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least chancellor schröder can rely on one person to share a smile with .
the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .
the country 's business elite declared that over the next 12 months germany would become ever more unattractive to investors .
the government 's policies , they said uniformly , were ruinous .
popularity at record low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the titel of the book should be : the chancellor all at sea. although the original title , the chancellor lives in a swimming pool is also quite fitting.the subtitle , by the way , is intriguing : how politics work .
if schröder was expecting some sort of respite on friday , he was wrong .
the monthly politbarometer opinion poll found that the chancellor 's popularity in the eight weeks since re-election had plummeted to a record post-war low .
support for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped to 34 percent from the 38.5 percent it won in september .
the opposition , meanwhile , has jumped from 38.5 percent to 44 percent .
in another survey on the political mood in the country , the spd dropped to 26 percent , down 10 points from october and 20 from september .
asked why support for the government had fallen more dramatically than at any other time since world war ii , the spd 's general secretary olaf scholz said : " no one can expect applause to break out when a government has to make difficult decisions like this that cause pain . "
and it looks like the painful times for schröder have only just begun . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .

23 , 2002 -rrb- brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .

the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame . an oil tanker that has been spilling its load into the sea off the coast of spain has sparked an international row surrounding accusations of who is to blame .
the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker registered in the bahamas , has already spilled many of the 77,000 tons of oil it was carrying when it got into trouble during vicious storms that have been battering spain and portugal for the past few days .
the tanker is said to have a crack in one of its oil tanks and has been emptying its contents into the atlantic ocean since wednesday evening .
" it looks as if one of the tanks has emptied itself ... they usually hold around 3,000 tons , " a spokesman at the emergency coordination center in la coruna told reuters on thursday .
it is estimated that the ship has lost half that amount from the holed tank .
emergency workers are still trying to get the stricken tanker away from the largely unspoiled northwest spanish coastline and avert an ecological disaster .
reports suggest an oil slick five miles long is trailing in the tanker 's wake , which was last reported to be listing at an angle of 50 degrees and in real danger of sinking .
rescue teams have managed to airlift 24 of the 27 crew off the prestige , leaving the captain and two other crew members to assist in salvage operations .
it is hoped that the tanker can be towed into deeper waters where , if it should sink , it would prove to be less of a threat to the galician coastline , an important fishing area .
eu blames britain and gibraltar for lack of inspection while efforts continue to stabilize the tanker , a storm of a different kind is brewing between the european union , britain and environmental groups as responsibility for the disaster gets passed from one to another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu blames a failure to inspect properly on the gibraltar authorities .
the eu is angry with britain and its mediterranean outpost gibraltar , claiming that proper checks were not carry out on the tanker when it docked at the rock before its latest journey from latvia .
the office of eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio , has sent british authorities a letter questioning whether it carried out the required inspections of the prestige .
palacio said , under new rules , port authorities had to check 25 percent of all ships coming into dock and added that such inspections should be especially targeted at ships with a history of problems .
he claims that the british authorities did not act under the new rules and as a consequence the tanker left gibraltar in an unsatisfactory state .
the spanish government has echoed the eu 's condemnation .
eu , spain have placed blamed too soon , says governor in response , the governor of gibraltar david durie criticized the eu and spain for holding the british colony responsible for the disaster .
" both the spanish government and the eu commission appear to have shot from the hip , " he told afp .
" shooting from the hip is not normally very accurate .
on this occasion they both appear to have shot themselves in the foot . "
in a statement released on thursday , the gibraltar government said that the prestige had visited the colony only once in the past four years and was not officially heading there on this trip .
environmentalists , who have warned that one of spain 's most scenic regions could face ecological catastrophe if the tanker continues to spill its cargo , have placed the blame on the eu 's doorstep .
greens pushed eu to take steps but with no action taken the prestige , an aging single-hulled 44,000-ton vessel , was built in japan in 1976 and last underwent inspection in 1999 .
environmentalists have long argued for stricter eu regulations demanding single-hulled vessels to be phased out and replaced with reinforced hulls of double thickness .
the eu has said that single-hulled tankers will be phased out completely by 2015 .
many green organizations believe that , together with the plan to implement a ban on tankers of the prestige 's type and age in 2005 , the eu actions will be too little too late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gibraltar pledges allegiance to the crown on thursday nearly 99 percent of gibraltarians said they did not want britain and spain to share sovereignty of their tiny territory . -lrb- 08/11/2002 -rrb- www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .
the country 's business elite declared that over the next 12 months germany would become ever more unattractive to investors .
the government 's policies , they said uniformly , were ruinous .

if schröder was expecting some sort of respite on friday , he was wrong .
the monthly politbarometer opinion poll found that the chancellor 's popularity in the eight weeks since re-election had plummeted to a record post-war low .
support for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped to 34 percent from the 38.5 percent it won in september .
the opposition , meanwhile , has jumped from 38.5 percent to 44 percent .
in another survey on the political mood in the country , the spd dropped to 26 percent , down 10 points from october and 20 from september .
asked why support for the government had fallen more dramatically than at any other time since world war ii , the spd 's general secretary olaf scholz said : " no one can expect applause to break out when a government has to make difficult decisions like this that cause pain . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.11.2002 black week for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least chancellor schröder can rely on one person to share a smile with .
the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .
the country 's business elite declared that over the next 12 months germany would become ever more unattractive to investors .
the government 's policies , they said uniformly , were ruinous .
popularity at record low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the titel of the book should be : the chancellor all at sea. although the original title , the chancellor lives in a swimming pool is also quite fitting.the subtitle , by the way , is intriguing : how politics work .
if schröder was expecting some sort of respite on friday , he was wrong .
the monthly politbarometer opinion poll found that the chancellor 's popularity in the eight weeks since re-election had plummeted to a record post-war low .
support for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped to 34 percent from the 38.5 percent it won in september .
the opposition , meanwhile , has jumped from 38.5 percent to 44 percent .
in another survey on the political mood in the country , the spd dropped to 26 percent , down 10 points from october and 20 from september .
asked why support for the government had fallen more dramatically than at any other time since world war ii , the spd 's general secretary olaf scholz said : " no one can expect applause to break out when a government has to make difficult decisions like this that cause pain . "
and it looks like the painful times for schröder have only just begun . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .
they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . -lrb- sept .
23 , 2002 -rrb- brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .
but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules .
-lrb- oct.18 , 2002 -rrb- eu commission fires warning shot at germany over budget the bombshell hit on wednesday : germany is practically on the brink of a deep recession .
non-existent growth , massive revenue shortfalls and eu disciplinary action all spell bad news for the sick man of europe .

the party 's honorary chairman otto graf lambsdorff said all party members who knew of or were involved in the controversial funding of an anti-israeli pamphlet distributed just before september 's election should be held responsible .
the leaflet was möllemann 's brainchild , but lambsdorff pointed out that the distribution of 8 million leaflets " can not be the work of a single person . "
illegal donations into account bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chairman guido westerwelle enters the podium at the fdp headquarters in berlin , sunday sept .
22 , 2002 .
the liberals fell short of reaching their goal of 18 percent , scoring just slightly above seven percent .
-lrb- ap photo / frank augstein -rrb- that will be music to the ears of the beleaguered möllemann -lrb- pictured right -rrb- who is accused of using undeclared donations to the party to fund the controversial project .
the fdp 's treasurer , günter rexrodt , has said that a total of € 840,000 -lrb- $ 844,000 -rrb- in anonymous donations ranging from € 1,000 to € 8,000 was paid into an fdp-linked account .
the pamphlet in question featured a picture of israeli prime minister sharon , blasting him for sending tanks into palestinian refugee camps .
it also picked a fight with his long-time rival michel friedman , deputy leader of the council of jews in germany , whose intolerant and hateful behavior , möllemann said , were fostering anti-semitism .
feds launch official probe german prosecutors earlier this month opened a probe into möllemann , who until recently headed the fdp 's north rhine-westphalia branch , the biggest in germany .
he stepped down following questions over the source of the funds and now faces the threat of expulsion from the party .
however , the problems do not end there for the party , with further fdp politicians being sucked into the scandal .
the latest victim is wolfgang gerhardt , who currently heads the party 's parliamentary group .
during his tenure as party chairman in the late 1990s , the fdp parliamentary state and federal groups allegedly paid a number of large donations onto the party 's central accounts .
worried that the large amount of money would raise some eyebrows , gerhardt siphoned off around € 153,000 and returned it to the party as a temporary loan .
by doing so , observers say he violated party financing law , which explicitly forbids that money from the parliamentary group coffers be passed on to party accounts .
fighting talk meanwhile , in typically fighting fashion möllemann has said he will not go quietly .

political observers say that westerwelle covertly shares möllemann 's ideological views and his radical ideas for positioning the party better in the public eye .
however , some of those plans backfired in the pre-election period , most notably the campaign to obtain 18 percent of the vote as the fdp struggled to pick up a significantly lower 7.4 percent , effectively ruining its chances of forming a coalition government with the conservative christian democrats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.11.2002 black week for german chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least chancellor schröder can rely on one person to share a smile with .
the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .
the country 's business elite declared that over the next 12 months germany would become ever more unattractive to investors .
the government 's policies , they said uniformly , were ruinous .
popularity at record low bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the titel of the book should be : the chancellor all at sea. although the original title , the chancellor lives in a swimming pool is also quite fitting.the subtitle , by the way , is intriguing : how politics work .
if schröder was expecting some sort of respite on friday , he was wrong .
the monthly politbarometer opinion poll found that the chancellor 's popularity in the eight weeks since re-election had plummeted to a record post-war low .
support for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped to 34 percent from the 38.5 percent it won in september .
the opposition , meanwhile , has jumped from 38.5 percent to 44 percent .
in another survey on the political mood in the country , the spd dropped to 26 percent , down 10 points from october and 20 from september .
asked why support for the government had fallen more dramatically than at any other time since world war ii , the spd 's general secretary olaf scholz said : " no one can expect applause to break out when a government has to make difficult decisions like this that cause pain . "
and it looks like the painful times for schröder have only just begun . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's back to the economy again schröder ’ s narrow victory is not music to the ears of business and industry leaders .
they ’ re chanting for change and structural reforms of the ailing german economy . -lrb- sept .
23 , 2002 -rrb- brussels waves big stick over german deficit germany could face billions of euros in penalties for violating the european union ’ s stability pact .
but chancellor schröder hopes the eurocrats won ’ t be too rigid in applying the rules .
-lrb- oct.18 , 2002 -rrb- eu commission fires warning shot at germany over budget the bombshell hit on wednesday : germany is practically on the brink of a deep recession .
non-existent growth , massive revenue shortfalls and eu disciplinary action all spell bad news for the sick man of europe .

the party 's honorary chairman otto graf lambsdorff said all party members who knew of or were involved in the controversial funding of an anti-israeli pamphlet distributed just before september 's election should be held responsible .
the leaflet was möllemann 's brainchild , but lambsdorff pointed out that the distribution of 8 million leaflets " can not be the work of a single person . "
illegal donations into account bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chairman guido westerwelle enters the podium at the fdp headquarters in berlin , sunday sept .

-lrb- ap photo / frank augstein -rrb- that will be music to the ears of the beleaguered möllemann -lrb- pictured right -rrb- who is accused of using undeclared donations to the party to fund the controversial project .
the fdp 's treasurer , günter rexrodt , has said that a total of € 840,000 -lrb- $ 844,000 -rrb- in anonymous donations ranging from € 1,000 to € 8,000 was paid into an fdp-linked account .
the pamphlet in question featured a picture of israeli prime minister sharon , blasting him for sending tanks into palestinian refugee camps .
it also picked a fight with his long-time rival michel friedman , deputy leader of the council of jews in germany , whose intolerant and hateful behavior , möllemann said , were fostering anti-semitism .
feds launch official probe german prosecutors earlier this month opened a probe into möllemann , who until recently headed the fdp 's north rhine-westphalia branch , the biggest in germany .
he stepped down following questions over the source of the funds and now faces the threat of expulsion from the party .
however , the problems do not end there for the party , with further fdp politicians being sucked into the scandal .
the latest victim is wolfgang gerhardt , who currently heads the party 's parliamentary group .
during his tenure as party chairman in the late 1990s , the fdp parliamentary state and federal groups allegedly paid a number of large donations onto the party 's central accounts .
worried that the large amount of money would raise some eyebrows , gerhardt siphoned off around € 153,000 and returned it to the party as a temporary loan .
by doing so , observers say he violated party financing law , which explicitly forbids that money from the parliamentary group coffers be passed on to party accounts .
fighting talk meanwhile , in typically fighting fashion möllemann has said he will not go quietly .

the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame . an oil tanker that has been spilling its load into the sea off the coast of spain has sparked an international row surrounding accusations of who is to blame .
the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker registered in the bahamas , has already spilled many of the 77,000 tons of oil it was carrying when it got into trouble during vicious storms that have been battering spain and portugal for the past few days .
the tanker is said to have a crack in one of its oil tanks and has been emptying its contents into the atlantic ocean since wednesday evening .
" it looks as if one of the tanks has emptied itself ... they usually hold around 3,000 tons , " a spokesman at the emergency coordination center in la coruna told reuters on thursday .
it is estimated that the ship has lost half that amount from the holed tank .
emergency workers are still trying to get the stricken tanker away from the largely unspoiled northwest spanish coastline and avert an ecological disaster .
reports suggest an oil slick five miles long is trailing in the tanker 's wake , which was last reported to be listing at an angle of 50 degrees and in real danger of sinking .
rescue teams have managed to airlift 24 of the 27 crew off the prestige , leaving the captain and two other crew members to assist in salvage operations .
it is hoped that the tanker can be towed into deeper waters where , if it should sink , it would prove to be less of a threat to the galician coastline , an important fishing area .
eu blames britain and gibraltar for lack of inspection while efforts continue to stabilize the tanker , a storm of a different kind is brewing between the european union , britain and environmental groups as responsibility for the disaster gets passed from one to another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu blames a failure to inspect properly on the gibraltar authorities .
the eu is angry with britain and its mediterranean outpost gibraltar , claiming that proper checks were not carry out on the tanker when it docked at the rock before its latest journey from latvia .
the office of eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio , has sent british authorities a letter questioning whether it carried out the required inspections of the prestige .
palacio said , under new rules , port authorities had to check 25 percent of all ships coming into dock and added that such inspections should be especially targeted at ships with a history of problems .
he claims that the british authorities did not act under the new rules and as a consequence the tanker left gibraltar in an unsatisfactory state .
the spanish government has echoed the eu 's condemnation .
eu , spain have placed blamed too soon , says governor in response , the governor of gibraltar david durie criticized the eu and spain for holding the british colony responsible for the disaster .
" both the spanish government and the eu commission appear to have shot from the hip , " he told afp .
" shooting from the hip is not normally very accurate .
on this occasion they both appear to have shot themselves in the foot . "
in a statement released on thursday , the gibraltar government said that the prestige had visited the colony only once in the past four years and was not officially heading there on this trip .
environmentalists , who have warned that one of spain 's most scenic regions could face ecological catastrophe if the tanker continues to spill its cargo , have placed the blame on the eu 's doorstep .
greens pushed eu to take steps but with no action taken the prestige , an aging single-hulled 44,000-ton vessel , was built in japan in 1976 and last underwent inspection in 1999 .
environmentalists have long argued for stricter eu regulations demanding single-hulled vessels to be phased out and replaced with reinforced hulls of double thickness .
the eu has said that single-hulled tankers will be phased out completely by 2015 .
many green organizations believe that , together with the plan to implement a ban on tankers of the prestige 's type and age in 2005 , the eu actions will be too little too late . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gibraltar pledges allegiance to the crown on thursday nearly 99 percent of gibraltarians said they did not want britain and spain to share sovereignty of their tiny territory . -lrb- 08/11/2002 -rrb- www-links the eu observer up-to-date reports on issues and news from around the european union .

the stricken tanker continuing to spew oil into the sea off the coast of spain has prompted a bitter row between the eu , britain and environmental groups over who should take the blame . an oil tanker that has been spilling its load into the sea off the coast of spain has sparked an international row surrounding accusations of who is to blame .
the prestige , a greek-owned oil tanker registered in the bahamas , has already spilled many of the 77,000 tons of oil it was carrying when it got into trouble during vicious storms that have been battering spain and portugal for the past few days .
the tanker is said to have a crack in one of its oil tanks and has been emptying its contents into the atlantic ocean since wednesday evening .
" it looks as if one of the tanks has emptied itself ... they usually hold around 3,000 tons , " a spokesman at the emergency coordination center in la coruna told reuters on thursday .
it is estimated that the ship has lost half that amount from the holed tank .
emergency workers are still trying to get the stricken tanker away from the largely unspoiled northwest spanish coastline and avert an ecological disaster .
reports suggest an oil slick five miles long is trailing in the tanker 's wake , which was last reported to be listing at an angle of 50 degrees and in real danger of sinking .
rescue teams have managed to airlift 24 of the 27 crew off the prestige , leaving the captain and two other crew members to assist in salvage operations .
it is hoped that the tanker can be towed into deeper waters where , if it should sink , it would prove to be less of a threat to the galician coastline , an important fishing area .
eu blames britain and gibraltar for lack of inspection while efforts continue to stabilize the tanker , a storm of a different kind is brewing between the european union , britain and environmental groups as responsibility for the disaster gets passed from one to another .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu blames a failure to inspect properly on the gibraltar authorities .
the eu is angry with britain and its mediterranean outpost gibraltar , claiming that proper checks were not carry out on the tanker when it docked at the rock before its latest journey from latvia .
the office of eu transport commissioner , loyola de palacio , has sent british authorities a letter questioning whether it carried out the required inspections of the prestige .
palacio said , under new rules , port authorities had to check 25 percent of all ships coming into dock and added that such inspections should be especially targeted at ships with a history of problems .
he claims that the british authorities did not act under the new rules and as a consequence the tanker left gibraltar in an unsatisfactory state .
the spanish government has echoed the eu 's condemnation .
eu , spain have placed blamed too soon , says governor in response , the governor of gibraltar david durie criticized the eu and spain for holding the british colony responsible for the disaster .
" both the spanish government and the eu commission appear to have shot from the hip , " he told afp .
" shooting from the hip is not normally very accurate .
on this occasion they both appear to have shot themselves in the foot . "
in a statement released on thursday , the gibraltar government said that the prestige had visited the colony only once in the past four years and was not officially heading there on this trip .
environmentalists , who have warned that one of spain 's most scenic regions could face ecological catastrophe if the tanker continues to spill its cargo , have placed the blame on the eu 's doorstep .
greens pushed eu to take steps but with no action taken the prestige , an aging single-hulled 44,000-ton vessel , was built in japan in 1976 and last underwent inspection in 1999 .
environmentalists have long argued for stricter eu regulations demanding single-hulled vessels to be phased out and replaced with reinforced hulls of double thickness .
the eu has said that single-hulled tankers will be phased out completely by 2015 .

the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .
and the government seems to have morphed into a state of paralysis , unable to react to the never-ending saga of germany 's economic woes .
revenue shortfall schröder must have had an inkling of what to expect on monday , when rumors abounded that the government was facing a massive shortfall in tax revenues for 2002 .
this would not only affect the federal government , but also the states many of whom are facing severe financial difficulties .
there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .
in what is now known as black wednesday , the floodgates opened and unleashed a torrent of bleak economic data , even worse than anyone had predicted .
the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .
germany , they said , was heading for recession in the first half of next year .
their remedy : a fundamental overhaul of the rigid labor market and painful reforms to the expensive social security system .
snub from brussels schröder and his cabinet were still reeling from the impact , when the eu commission piled on even more agony .
brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .
the opposition center-right parties called for eichel 's resignation and declared the government to be economically incompetent .
the country 's business elite declared that over the next 12 months germany would become ever more unattractive to investors .
the government 's policies , they said uniformly , were ruinous .

if schröder was expecting some sort of respite on friday , he was wrong .
the monthly politbarometer opinion poll found that the chancellor 's popularity in the eight weeks since re-election had plummeted to a record post-war low .
support for his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped to 34 percent from the 38.5 percent it won in september .
the opposition , meanwhile , has jumped from 38.5 percent to 44 percent .
in another survey on the political mood in the country , the spd dropped to 26 percent , down 10 points from october and 20 from september .
asked why support for the government had fallen more dramatically than at any other time since world war ii , the spd 's general secretary olaf scholz said : " no one can expect applause to break out when a government has to make difficult decisions like this that cause pain . "

the schröder government is facing what is likely to be its toughest test yet , as it battles against the tide of economic doom and gloom .
as yet , there is little cause for hope . gerhard schröder and his cabinet will breathe a sigh of relief that this week is over .
and the german chancellor and his government coalition of social democrats and greens will hope that the weekend offers a little respite .
on friday at least there was a slight sense of achievement , after the government 's first major reform package targeting the labor market was passed in parliament .
the reform , based on recommendations by a commission headed by peter hartz , a leading volkswagen manager , aims to streamline employment placement programs in order to offer germany 's 4 million unemployed a job .
other measures are aimed at relaxing rules on temporary work arrangements .
the government managed to push the package through the bundestag by 305 votes to 280 .
it has been a turbulent week for the government with revelation upon revelation of bad economic news that has shaken the very foundations of the country .

there was little or no sleep for schröder and his finance minister hans eichel on tuesday with the ominous cloud of further bad news hanging over them .

the government 's independent council of economic advisers , the so-called five wise men , informed schröder that germany would register little or no growth for this year and predicted an almost negligible increase for 2003 .

brussels announced that it was initiating its so-called excessive deficit procedure against germany , a formal warning over its budget deficit .
ironically , it was germany , along with france , that had vehemently advocated strict adherence to the rules laid out by the stability and growth pact , which sets a deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
conservative estimates put germany 's figure at 3.7 percent for 2002 , with little improvement expected next year .
schröder and eichel put on brave faces , saying they had no qualms with the commission 's decision , yet inwardly they must have been seething at the snub from brussels .
reactions poured in fast and furious .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.11.2002 fdp in state of paralysis over undeclared donations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an fdp campaign ploy during happier times germany 's liberal party is stumbling around trying desperately to find a way out of the quagmire of illegal donations and accusations that have reached party leadership and plunged its popularity among voters . jürgen w. möllemann , the charismatic nightmare to his own party , germany 's free democrats , received support from an unexpected quarter on thursday .
the party 's honorary chairman otto graf lambsdorff said all party members who knew of or were involved in the controversial funding of an anti-israeli pamphlet distributed just before september 's election should be held responsible .
the leaflet was möllemann 's brainchild , but lambsdorff pointed out that the distribution of 8 million leaflets " can not be the work of a single person . "
illegal donations into account bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german liberal party -lrb- fdp -rrb- chairman guido westerwelle enters the podium at the fdp headquarters in berlin , sunday sept .
22 , 2002 .
the liberals fell short of reaching their goal of 18 percent , scoring just slightly above seven percent .
-lrb- ap photo / frank augstein -rrb- that will be music to the ears of the beleaguered möllemann -lrb- pictured right -rrb- who is accused of using undeclared donations to the party to fund the controversial project .
the fdp 's treasurer , günter rexrodt , has said that a total of € 840,000 -lrb- $ 844,000 -rrb- in anonymous donations ranging from € 1,000 to € 8,000 was paid into an fdp-linked account .
the pamphlet in question featured a picture of israeli prime minister sharon , blasting him for sending tanks into palestinian refugee camps .
it also picked a fight with his long-time rival michel friedman , deputy leader of the council of jews in germany , whose intolerant and hateful behavior , möllemann said , were fostering anti-semitism .
feds launch official probe german prosecutors earlier this month opened a probe into möllemann , who until recently headed the fdp 's north rhine-westphalia branch , the biggest in germany .
he stepped down following questions over the source of the funds and now faces the threat of expulsion from the party .
however , the problems do not end there for the party , with further fdp politicians being sucked into the scandal .
the latest victim is wolfgang gerhardt , who currently heads the party 's parliamentary group .
during his tenure as party chairman in the late 1990s , the fdp parliamentary state and federal groups allegedly paid a number of large donations onto the party 's central accounts .
worried that the large amount of money would raise some eyebrows , gerhardt siphoned off around € 153,000 and returned it to the party as a temporary loan .
by doing so , observers say he violated party financing law , which explicitly forbids that money from the parliamentary group coffers be passed on to party accounts .
fighting talk meanwhile , in typically fighting fashion möllemann has said he will not go quietly .

moellemann hat am sonntag , 20 .
oktober 2002 seinen sofortigen ruecktritt sowohl als nrw fdp landeschef als auch als nrw fdp fraktionsvorsitzender erklaert his remarks are seen as a swipe at the youthful party leader guido westerwelle -lrb- pictured left -rrb- , who is attempting to remain above the fray .
political observers say that westerwelle covertly shares möllemann 's ideological views and his radical ideas for positioning the party better in the public eye .
however , some of those plans backfired in the pre-election period , most notably the campaign to obtain 18 percent of the vote as the fdp struggled to pick up a significantly lower 7.4 percent , effectively ruining its chances of forming a coalition government with the conservative christian democrats .
and there was more bad news for the party on thursday with the release of a poll that showed the fdp just barely scraping past the 5 percent barrier needed to enter parliament if the election were held this sunday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de troublemaker möllemann steps down from throne the controversial german free democrat jürgen möllemann resigned as regional party leader of north-rhine westphalia in response to allegations that he used illegal donations to finance a brochure critical of israel .

the worst incident so far during the walk out has been the death of four people at a farm house fire near devizes , wiltshire , in the early hours of friday .
it is understood the dead are a mother and three children aged eight , 11 and 15 .
the fire was attended by a retained crew - non-striking part-timers - from the local area who would have been covering the area even if no industrial action had been taking place .
a police spokesman said : " this tragedy has nothing to do with the dispute . "
the first fatal incident was in newtown , wales , one hour after the start of the walkout .
the raf green goddess team was sent to the woman 's home at 1904 gmt on wednesday and arrived within nine minutes .
firefighters left their picket lines to assist and helped the army crew to rescue 76-year-old violet davies from her smoke-filled bedroom and out of the house .
violet davies was the first fatality she was treated by paramedics at the scene , but later died in hospital .
according to the fire brigades union , the raf team were on the scene no slower than a fire engine on a non-strike day .
dick pearson , wales regional officer of the fire brigades union , said it appeared the woman 's death would not have been avoided even if a regular fire crew had been the first on the scene .

the images of picket lines , placards and braziers took him back a quarter of a century to a dispute that now looks uncannily familiar .
on 14 november 1977 , firefighters across the united kingdom walked out in support of a 30 % pay claim .
eric was a fireman at fulwell fire station in sunderland . "
i was crying when the firefighters came out ... i know what the lads are going through " eric brandon 1977 striker he spent the next nine weeks on the picket line , before the strike crumbled and the firefighters went back to work .
" everybody was skint , and just wanted to call it a day , " eric recalls .
" i think the same thing is going to happen this time .
the government is not going to back down .
who can give in to a demand for a 40 % rise ?
" i think there may be a compromise , based on changes to the fire service , but in the end they will have to go back . "
low pay eric became a fireman in 1972 , after leaving the royal navy , having served on board aircraft carriers with the fleet air arm .
he found many similarities in the way the fire service was run , and immediately felt at home .
" the regulations , the marching , the salute ... it was very much like the navy tradition , " he says .
" i was used to working with men in the navy , and i liked the comradeship of the fire brigade , even though the money was terrible .
" i look a pay cut of about £ 20 a week when i became a fireman . "
depression so when the strike was called , eric joined his friends on the picket line .
but it was not an easy decision .
" it was the most depressing day of my life , " he says . "
it is all to do with bargaining , and it has gone wrong for them , as it did for us " eric brandon " i hated having to walk out .
we were trained to serve the public , but when we went on strike , we just could n't do that any more .
" after we came out , i went round to all the houses in the area , handing out government leaflets advising people on the precautions they should take , like not lighting candles .
" the public was very sympathetic in 1977 , but the dispute left a lot of bad feeling , especially about the police .
" they were earning a fortune in overtime , and they used to wave their pay slips at us . "
tears after nine weeks without pay , the firefighters reluctantly abandoned their strike .
they went back to work for the same money they had been offered when they walked out , although the dispute did result in the adoption of a new pay formula .
" it meant that we did quite well over the next couple of years , " says eric .
" but i shed some tears when we went back , and i vowed that i was going to better myself . "
eric received a payment of £ 150 for returning to work , and bought a van .
in his spare time , he began a loft insulation business .
today he has a fleet of twenty vans , and employs nearly fifty people .
so for him , the strike of 1977 did have a positive outcome , although it left a legacy of bitterness that was to last years .
" i have mixed emotions about it now , " he said .
" it was the worst time of my life , but it made me get off my backside . "
gamble eric brandon spent 26 years in the fire service before he finally retired , four years ago .
his advice to the strikers of 2002 , based on his own experience , is to enter into negotiations as soon as possible to resolve the dispute .
" it is all to do with bargaining , and it has gone wrong for them , as it did for us , " he says .
" they were hoping for 40 % , but would probably have settled for 20 % .
it was a gamble that did n't pay off .
" it is a very sad time for all firefighters .
i was crying again when they came out yesterday .
" i know what the lads are going through .
they were forced to do it , partly by the union but also by circumstances .
" now everyone should get back round the table and keep talking .
it is the only way to settle anything . "

the pentagon has been looking at how it might support the un weapons inspectors even as it continues planning for the possibility of a military showdown should the inspection process collapse . "
the most significant capability the pentagon is likely to bring to the inspection process is still the big stick " un official and senior us defence officials have suggested to the bbc that that support would most likely be in the form of surveillance aircraft and intelligence rather than any actual military protection .
it is unlikely the inspectors would ask for such protection from washington .
pentagon officials say as yet they have not had any formal requests from the inspectors but one of the capabilities washington lent to the previous inspectors was a u2 reconnaissance aircraft - much to the annoyance of the iraqis .
spies in the sky the new un resolution raises the possibility that the inspectors could use different types of aircraft , including unmanned aerial vehicles or drones .
the americans already use unmanned predator surveillance drones over iraq to help police the no-fly zones .
the inspectors are likely to approach a number of countries for different types of assistance , just as they did during the previous inspections .
still one senior un defence official told the bbc that the most significant capability the pentagon is likely to bring to the inspection process is , as he put it , the big stick - the overall threat of possible military action .

i know what you say represents the views of a lot of british muslims who are very worried about this tony blair in an interview with radio 1 listeners , mr blair said he hoped to persuade people the threat of military action had " nothing to do with iraq being a muslim country " .
in a wide-ranging question and answer session , the prime minister also spoke about the euro , the firefighters strike , fox-hunting - and which radio 1 dj he would like to be .
he also touched on his musical tastes , confessing to a fondness for irish band u2 and the new album by us hard rockers the foo fighters .
cabinet splits denied click here to listen to tony blair on radio 1 among the trickier questions fired at the pm by the young audience were : " you keep referring to whether we should attack iraq .
" if your cabinet is divided and you have n't had a referendum , is it simply the " royal we " you are referring to ? "
mr blair denied there were any cabinet splits on the issue .
replying to a listener who said british muslims could not support him , mr blair said he " passionately " believed the threat against iraq had " nothing to do with iraq being a muslim country " .
" it is to do with the weapons of mass destruction that saddam has .
" i think it would be a tragedy if an issue which is really to do with weapons of mass destruction becomes a religious issue , " mr blair insisted .
fire strike the prime minister added : " i know what you say represents the views of a lot of british muslims who are very worried about this " .
family favourite : coldplay 's chris martin mr blair also defended the government 's stance on the fire fighters strike .
" no government could concede a 40 % wage claim , with 2 % inflation .
" interest rates would go up , unemployment would go up , your mortgages would go up and we would lose control of the economy " .
music tastes battling a sore throat , the prime minister said his insight into pop music was these days limited to what he could hear emanating from his children 's bedrooms .
he said he " usually listens to the albums that my kids listen to .. coldplay , there 's a new foo fighters .
" when you 've got teenage children , .. you 're trying to get through your boxes , the sounds are usually bouncing off the walls " .
sniggers mr blair , who famously sang in a rock band at oxford and once played host to noel gallagher of oasis at downing street , said his own " favourite " listening was u2 .
mr blair provoked a few sniggers and cries of " aaah " by saying the first record he bought was " i want to hold your hand " by the beatles .
" i was only 10 at the time , " he hastily added .
he was similarly discomfited when asked which radio 1 dj he would be .
mr blair eventually replied : " in my day it was more like john peel " - perhaps unaware the veteran dj still works for radio 1 .
the interview was also broadcast on the bbc 's new digital network 1xtra .

the plans for extra spending will be announced next week - and could push the government into a breach of its promise to keep its own immense debt burden under control .
according to finance minister masajuro shiokawa , the new spending is needed to make up a deficiency in tax collections of up to 2.8 trillion yen -lrb- $ 23.2bn ; £ 14.6bn -rrb- , caused by the continuing weakness of the economy , rising unemployment and struggling corporations .
the overall size of the package is still unclear , and will depend on negotiations within the heavily factionalised ruling party , but the asahi shimbun newspaper predicted it would reach 5 trillion yen .
troublesome vagueness the lack of detail on the package 's possible contents is worrying observers .
japan 's public debt tops 140 % of its total annual national output , the result of a sequence of similar " supplementary budget " moves throughout the 1990s funded by huge borrowing .
the aim was to kick-start the economy in the wake of the collapse of the asset price bubble which inflated in the 1980s .
but the result was that money was spent on make-work public infrastructure projects largely designed to prop up ruling party politicians ' standing in their constituencies , and help the construction , property and retail companies which pay their election expenses .
these sectors bear the heaviest burden of bad debts , handed out by friendly banks during the 1980s and secured against shares and real estate whose value has now slumped .

at the same time , bank bosses were telling a parliamentary committee that they do not need an injection of public funds .
the fear that the process of cleaning up at least 50 trillion yen and probably much more in non-performing loans could result in nationalisation of one or more of the big players is driving the share selloff .

the toughening stance of ministers came as firefighters were standing firm more than half way through their 48-hour walk out .
fireworks exploded from a blaze in manchester as it emerged soldiers were already training to use modern appliances , home office minister lord falconer said : " if public safety ultimately requires that the army cross picket lines to get the red fire engines then that is what will have to be done . "
earlier on thursday the leader of the fire brigades union , andy gilchrist , paid tribute to members who have crossed their own picket lines to answer emergency calls - but he again rejected the pay offer currently on the table .
the toughest test yet faced by troops manning the vintage green goddess fire engines came in manchester when a huge fire broke out at a fireworks factory in the city centre .
amid dramatic scenes , striking firefighters at a nearby station raised the alarm before temporarily crossing their picket line to help get a man out of the building .
they left the scene when troops arrived , and by evening the fire was out .

if there were further eight day stoppages in addition to the one planned for next week , " it may well be necessary to think about which picket lines need to be crossed , " he added .
armed forces have not had to cross picket lines yet earlier , downing street confirmed some army units around the country had already begun training on spare appliances normally kept at the national fire training college .

the 16 locations searched by authorities around los angeles and in las vegas included knight 's homes , as well as headquarters of tha row records , formerly death row records , the influential hip-hop label he founded and owns .
but knight , who was released from prison last year after serving four years in jail for a parole violation , was not a suspect , said officials for the los angeles county sheriff 's department .
police issued a total of 16 search warrants at offices and homes in los angeles and las vegas .
officers were also keen to stress that the probe was not related to the unsolved murders of death row recording star tupac shakur in 1996 or rival rap artist notorious big in 1997 .
there was also nothing to suggest the action was in any way related to the investigation into the recent murder in new york of former run-dmc rap star jam master jay , whose real name was jason mizell .
" this is strictly a gang-related murder -lrb- investigation -rrb- , " said captain pete amico , commander of the sheriff 's anti-gang unit .
theodore peter kelly , 29 , michael leroy payne , 25 , and kordell depree knox , 37 were booked on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and were being held without bail .
officials said that five other men sought in the investigation remained at large .
captain amico said all the men were associates of knight , and that kelly had been arrested inside the offices of tha row .
criticism the raids , which also led to the arrests of two men on marijuana offences unrelated to the murder probe , were prompted by the gang-related death in april of then-death row employee alton mcdonald .
he was gunned down while in the city of compton , south of los angeles , and another man , eric daniels , was killed in june .
mcdonald was in las vegas with knight and shakur when the rap star was shot to death in september 1996 , according to the los angeles times .
knight 's lawyer , arthur barens , said his client had offered to co-operate , but criticised authorities for " heavy-handed tactics " .
shot he said knight 's pregnant wife was roused from their home , handcuffed and made to stand outside in the cold morning air during one of the raids .
knight was jailed in october 1996 for violating his probation on a previous assault conviction by allegedly kicking a man during a scuffle at a las vegas hotel .
the alleged incident took place hours before shakur was killed in a drive-by shooting in september 1996 .
knight was driving the car in which shakur was shot and was himself wounded .
rival rap star christopher wallace , known as notorious big or biggie smalls , was gunned down gangland style in los angeles in march 1997 .
conflict those killings remain unsolved , as does the shooting death of mizell , who was gunned down in a new york city recording studio on 30 oct .
meanwhile , a hip-hop peace summit opened in new york on thursday in memory of mizell .
the project - called simply hip-hop for peace - has been organised by the hip-hop summit youth council .
it has established a code of principles for artists to follow and a mediation board to deal with conflicts in moves to clean up the music 's image .
the music industry and artists will be asked to sign a memo of understanding to indicate they support the project .

the firefighters evacuated the house in ayr and extinguished the blaze before the green goddess fire tenders , operated by military personnel , arrived on the scene .
strathclyde fire brigade said fire appliances were locked to protect them and union officials had been informed of where the keys were being kept .
meanwhile , the number of hoax 999 calls received by the police and military saw a big reduction during the second night of the strike .

breathing apparatus firefighters ' claims that their attempts to assist military personnel had been hampered by fire engines being locked were dismissed as a " mystery " by fire chiefs .
two striking firefighters in ayr left the picket line on thursday night to rescue four adults and two children from a house .
firefighter robert gibson said the fire engines at the station had been locked .
he said : " we actually had to put breathing apparatus sets in to our own private cars with the firefighting kit and proceed as quickly as possible .
" we were there a good five minutes before the green goddesses and they were only quarter of a mile away .
the army says it has coped well " we had the fire out and everybody out of the house and then handed over to the army . "
strathclyde fire brigade 's deputy firemaster david kennedy said they had to have some process of protecting fire engines while stations were empty .
" we did speak to union officials and tell them what our policy would be and where the keys would be , " he said .
" if some people have forgotten that we are happy to remind them . "
he said the brigade would be happy to have a policy whereby striking firefighters were informed of any " life-risk " fires in their area that they may wish to respond to .

bacterium wars mr durdy 's firm - uk-based biotec laboratories - possesses a new means of diagnosing tb .
improved diagnosis , the who agrees , is a vital ally in the war against a bacterium which kills 2 million people a year .
" it would be a huge leap forward to have a new fast , accurate , cheap diagnostic method , " says dr chris dye , who co-ordinator of tb monitoring and evaluation .
tried and trusted ?
the most common technique in current use is is a dye and microscope technique pioneered a century ago .
the biotec test : it 's all in the petri dish its advantages are speed and low cost .
its downside is that is only 45-60 % accurate , and more reliable diagnostics eat up money or time .
" and while a sufferer is waiting for treatment , he can be spreading the disease , " mr durdy says .
new technology biotec has developed a test which , mr durdy says , can take accuracy rates to 90 % , and produce results within a day .
technologically , it is based around detecting viruses which attack the tb bacterium , a straightforward process , apparently .
" pathologists love it because they can just hold up a petri dish and say ' look at that ' , " mr durdy says .
and biotec loves it because it represents a means to exploit a vast market .
with one person infected with tb every second , about 1 billion extra people will be carriers by 2020 , the who estimates .
paying the bills still , there is the matter of paying for biotec 's diagnostic .
famous victims of the ' poor man 's disease ' john keats , poet anton chekhov , playwright george orwell , writer dh lawrence , author emily bronte , author frederic chopin , composer aubrey beardsley , artist doc holliday , gunslinger franz kafka , author cardinal richelieu , politician tb is know as the " poor man 's disease " because of its prevalence in developing countries .
and at around $ 1.50 a shot , plus training fees , biotec 's test may prove dear to poor nations .
" sure .
but consider the broader costs of tb , " mr durdy says .
research due to be published in kenya shows that the cost to the sufferer of contracting the disease is $ 60-100 , once travel to clinics , lost work days and perhaps the price of tests is accounted for .
mr durdy is a member of a who committee attempting to put its own price on tb .
" i would not be surprised if it comes out at $ 100-200 for each missed case .
" you have got transmission , the costs of treating a more developed disease .
the economics become quite scary . "
' coca-cola model ' besides , countries favouring biotec may one day see their custom rewarded through inward investment .
mr durdy has plans to expand biotec 's operations from the current headquarters , where it employs 30 people .
" it would be exciting to entertain the thought of manufacturing in our major markets .
" the advantage we have is that low cost-base environments are also high tb environments . "
he outlines the " coca-cola model " , which would see key products made in the uk , with the bulk of reagents manufactured in-country .
grand plans not that this is the limit of mr durdy 's ambitions - why stop at diagnostics ?
what we also need are new drugs , training for health workers .
a better diagnostic is only one link in the chain dr chris dye , who " there is a huge mileage in the tb market .
" what we can develop is expertise in distributing tb products as a whole .
" we are then in a position to become a channel through which all future tb developments - drugs , vaccines , whatever - reach the marketplace . "
one day , biotec may even move into the black , with profitability predicted " by the end of 2003 " .
hurdles to progress still , biotec yet faces considerable challenges before it can claim ownership of the tb niche .
plans for a stock market flotation have stalled amid a collapse in confidence in biotechs .
the firm 's tb diagnostic has also yet to gain the who support which would propel biotec into the big league .
" what we need is a test which is quick , cheap and can be used where laboratory conditions are simple , if they exist at all , " the who 's chris dye says .
" it may be out there , but we have not found it yet . "
meanwhile in india , china , south africa , even if the diagnostic proves its worth , it represents only part of the solution to tuberculosis .
" what we also need are new drugs , training for health workers , " dr dye says .
" a better diagnostic is only one link in the chain . "
or , as mr durdy might see it , only one box in the flow diagram .
