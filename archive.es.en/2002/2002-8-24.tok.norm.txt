this is not like the floods in europe with their huge swirling torrents of water surging their way across the continent .
dongting lake is more like a giant water-filled balloon that has been filled and filled until it is ready to pop .
all it needs is a tiny weakness , a pin-prick for its waters to come raging out across the surrounding land .
and so the struggle to hold back the waters continues day and night .
repeated problem sometimes there is drama , when water is spotted trickling through a tiny hole .
villagers and soldiers then rush to the spot , filling sandbags and piling on gravel and rocks to plug the hole and stop it from growing into a full-scale breach .
but most of the time there is little drama - just constant vigilance .
villagers in line abreast pace slowly along the high earth banks , their eyes cast downwards searching for any sign of a crack or a leak .
atop the dykes , at 100 metre intervals , others sprawl under canvas tents keeping up their 24-hour vigil .
the heat is stupefying , but no one complains .
" we 're used to this , " one villager told me as he filled sandbags and piled them onto a truck .
" we have to protect our homes and villages .
we do this every flood season , although it is not always this bad . "
and that is the simple truth : floods are nothing new to the people here - they are a part of the cycle of life .
higher walls the reason is simple also , even if the solution is not .
in china there are too many people competing for too little land . "
as the population pressure has grown , more and more land has been stolen from the lakes " good , flat , fertile land is scarce .
and most of it lies along rivers and valleys and on flood plains .
for centuries , china has fought to control its rivers and lakes - to hold them back behind high flood walls so the land can be cultivated .
and in the last half century , as the population pressure has grown , more and more land has been stolen from the lakes themselves .
dongting lake may be vast , but today it is only half the size it was 50 years ago .
it is little wonder that when china 's mighty rivers go into flood they have to be held back behind higher and higher walls .

the adult birds - which have a distinctive kaleidoscopic plumage - are feeding at least four chicks .
the news has generated much excitement among the public , with 10,000 people from up to 20 countries visiting the county durham site within one month .
for the last few weeks , the only sign there were chicks in the site were frequent visits from the parents , complete with beakfuls of bees .
but now the chicks ' faces have been seen at the entrance to the burrow , as they prepare to leave it for the first time .
the rspb says this indicates it may not be long before the birds start to fly .
bee-eater facts there are 26 species of bee-eater the bee-eater catches bees and other insects on the wing in the gambia , west africa , their name means " cousin to the fire " because of their attraction to bushfires they do n't usually like the uk , because they are " birds of the sun " the pair arrived at the disused quarry in bishop middleham in june and within weeks keen birdwatchers saw signs they had hatched chicks .
the last time a breeding pair of bee-eaters were seen in the uk was in 1955 when two pairs nesting in a sandpit in sussex raised seven chicks .
bee-eaters raise their chicks underground , in burrows excavated in cliff faces and up to three metres long .
the chicks have been taking it in turns to come to the mouth of the tunnel to await food deliveries from the parent birds .
the rspb and durham wildlife trust have mounted a 24-hour guard on the nest since the birds started nesting at the reserve , near sedgefield , in june .

the latest tension in kashmir has renewed fears of a full-scale war on the sub-continent .
it might seem that manpower and hardware figures speak for themselves .
india has 1.1 million soldiers , pakistan half that number .
india has 738 combat aircraft , pakistan 353 .
indian tanks outnumber those of pakistan by 3,400 to 2,300 , and so on .
if it does come to war , it appears it might be a walkover for india - but it is not as simple as that .
arsenal differences there a qualitative difference in favour of pakistan because , for example , india 's 400 mig-21s are barely airworthy and its t-72 tanks have not been properly overhauled for years . "
there can be no such thing as a ' surgical strike ' " and climate and terrain do not favour an attacker .
india 's defence secretary , yogendra narain , has said india has " a moral and legal right " to attack pakistan and that " surgical strikes are the realistic option " .
but there can be no such thing as a " surgical strike " because pakistan 's president pervez musharraf has made it clear that an indian attack on any scale would be regarded as an outright act of war .
war strategies from the statements by both sides one can judge how conflict might begin , spread and possibly end .
india would attack what it states are " terrorist camps " in pakistan-administered kashmir , probably with a brigade of some 3,000 infantry supported by indian air force -lrb- iaf -rrb- strike planes .
the air force would be at the forefront as the ground along most of the line of control between indian and pakistani kashmir is unsuitable for tanks and armoured divisions .
pakistan expects a thrust and has planned to counter-attack in force while itself striking iaf bases and increasing pressure elsewhere along the border .
india would have to commit more troops to extricate its brigade .
fighting would increase in intensity , with neither side able to force a conclusion .
it is probable that india would then launch an attack along the international border , in the southern plains , using its three armour-heavy " strike corps " .
heat aids defenders in summer , temperatures in the region can reach 45c -lrb- 113f -rrb- .
it is not impossible to fight in such heat , but it is extremely difficult - much more so for an attacker than a defender .
rising tension : 1 october 2001:38 killed in attack on the kashmir assembly in srinagar 13 december 2001:14 killed in attack on the indian parliament building in delhi 14 may 2002 : more than 30 killed in attack on an indian army camp in kashmir 21 may 2002 : moderate kashmiri politician abdul ghani lone shot dead t-72 tanks have poor air-conditioning that soaks up horsepower , and their commanders will be forced to have their heads out of turrets , which suits defenders .
pakistani defences are well-constructed .
there are deep minefields covered by fire , and many wide canals and other obstacles .
it is likely the iaf would achieve air superiority over the battlefield for extended periods , while its counterpart would concentrate on attacking iaf bases .
both sides would take severe casualties , but the indian attack would probably bog down .
indeed , it might do this literally , if the monsoon comes early .
mediation efforts world leaders would try to mediate , but it is probable this would be a fight to the finish .
nobody can predict the stage at which nuclear weapons could be involved .
india 's defence secretary stated that india does not know pakistan 's " nuclear threshold " .
but he said if there is a nuclear strike by pakistan : " we will retaliate and must be prepared for mutual destruction on both sides . "
rarely can there have been a more chilling message .

researchers found that children aged between 11 and 14 made up two-thirds of all bus accidents during journeys to and from school , with the majority being boys aged 12 or 13 .
the study , carried out by private consultants , looked at the role of buses in accidents in which children were killed or injured as pedestrians on journeys to and from school .
it found that most of the youngsters involved in accidents on schooldays between 1 january , 1999 and 31 december , 2000 were running after getting off a bus on their way home .
however , deputy transport minister lewis macdonald said the number of fatal and serious injuries among children had declined by more than 35 % since the mid-1990s .
