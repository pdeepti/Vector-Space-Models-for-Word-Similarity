economic analysts business strategies said the country 's economy will be back on track next year with reasonably healthy growth of 2.6 % .
this is behind the forecast of 3.1 % for the uk as a whole but is " well ahead " of scotland 's performance of 0.6 % last year and the expected 1.4 % this year .
tourism should enjoy better prospects the analysts said the economy will benefit from an upsurge in overseas tourists following a sharp downturn after the 11 september terror attacks on the us .
there should also be a rise in uk visitors choosing to holiday in scotland .
the report revealed that economically the borders is expected to lead the way ahead .
overall growth in that area is expected to reach 2.7 % next year , followed by glasgow , lothian and renfrewshire - each with 2.5 % .
fife is next with 2.3 % growth , ahead of grampian , lanarkshire and dumfries and galloway with 2.2 % .
clare reid , business strategies ' associate director , said : " after a tough year for scottish business , the indicators are that the worst is probably over .
' public spending ' " scottish manufacturers , especially those in the hi-tech sectors , were particularly badly hit by last year 's downturn .
" although they will see the benefits of stronger world demand , it is likely to be the second half of this year before this fully impacts on their business . "
ms reid warned that jobs were likely to be cut because of this .
she said : " the weaker growth will be offset by a rise in public spending and investment and further growth in private services .
" however , growth in private services will be slower , thanks to more moderate spending by scottish households . "
speaking about the prospects for tourism , ms reid said : " after two years of little growth , this year will be better , as overseas visitors are gradually attracted back and as more uk travellers choose to stay at home . "

in a speech to the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- dinner , mr blair defended the decision to put an extra penny on national insurance contributions .
you can not keep digging your hand into the business till without squandering the uk 's advantage sir iain vallance cbi president cbi president sir iain vallance said the budget had left a " sour taste " in the mouths of britain 's business community .
company bosses argue extra tax will make their firms less competitive and foreign banks have said the move could drive them abroad .
' enough is enough ' sir iain echoed those fears in his speech , saying the strength of reaction to the budget stems from anger at five years of " stealth " tax hikes coming to a head .
he said : " enough is enough .
you can not keep digging your hand into the business till without squandering the uk 's advantage as a country in which to do business . "
i was elected to fix our public services , schools and hospitals first , and that is what i intend to do tony blair mr blair said he was taking such fears " head-on " .
he said : " nobody likes paying taxes .
" even after the budget we remain a relatively low taxed economy and one of the best of the world to do business .
need for extra cash " but i was elected to fix our public services , schools and hospitals first , and that is what i intend to do . "
the need for extra investment in the national health service was now " beyond doubt " , he argued .
using other methods apart from general taxation would hit business harder , mr blair told city leaders at the black tie event .
" social insurance , as in germany and france , imposes huge costs on employers , as much as £ 60 per week per employee on top of other costs , " he continued .
private medical insurance is also expensive , he said , pointing to reports that employees ' medical insurance is set to rise by 25 % in some us states .
' no wastage ' general taxes are the fairest way of getting new money into healthcare , mr blair said .
the prime minister said " immense " reforms in the nhs would ensure that extra cash is not wasted .
better public services , including schools and universities , are needed by business more than anybody , he said .
mr blair pointed to real progress in education , saying a new international study to be published in coming days put britain in the world 's top eight for the " critical subjects " .
economic tests aside from the tax debate , british entry to the euro remains a key issue in the business world .
after his enthusiastic comments on the single currency last week , mr blair took a more routine approach at the cbi , which is reported to be going lukewarm on the issue .
labour 's policy of joining the euro if its economic tests were met and if voters agree in a referendum would stay , he said .
" if these economic conditions are met , then the british people will make a pragmatic hard-headed assessment of what is the right thing for british jobs , british industry , the standard of british families , " he added .
mr blair pointed at key strengths in the british economy but stressed there were still challenges that government and business together could tackle . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's evan davis " mr blair knows that if he is going to win a euro referendum , he has to get these leaders behind him " prime minister tony blair " we remain a relatively low taxed economy " david jordan , phillips electronics uk " there are areas of government policy that are eroding our advantage " full coverage key stories tax boost for nhs budget at-a-glance the steady economy health service boost payroll tax raised small firms gain schools promised more older women lose out analysis what it means for you huge change for nhs brown 's big gamble higher earners targeted business takes a hit the experts ' view quiz test your knowledge budget diaries individuals speak out audio video full budget coverage talking point your reaction your budget questions see also : 19 apr 02 -pipe- politics blair confident over nhs pledges 23 apr 02 -pipe- business new taxes turn business mood sour 22 apr 02 -pipe- business hewitt defends tax rise 19 apr 02 -pipe- politics tax rise ' threatens banking exodus ' internet links : confederation of british industry the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites e-mail this story to a friend ^ ^ back to top news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point -pipe- country profiles -pipe- in depth -pipe- programmes - to bbc sport > > -pipe- to bbc weather > > -pipe- to bbc world service > > - © mmiii -pipe- news sources -pipe- privacy

ben long , 23 , was shortlisted alongside leading art figures after submitting videos of his works .
the winner of the £ 10,000 pizza express prospects contemporary drawing prize was named on tuesday as ian davenport , for his wall illustration .
the judging was led by pop artist peter blake , who designed the famous cover for the beatles ' sgt pepper album .
some people are very intimidated by the idea of going to art galleries ben long an exhibition opened at the essor gallery project space in london on tuesday to show the work of the 70 shortlisted finalists , which also includes famous children 's book illustrator quentin blake .
the works that were up for the award used digital technology , light and video as well as conventional drawing media .
davenport , 35 , from peckham , south-east london , won with a lined wall drawing in the style of british designer paul smith .
susie allen , a director with artwise , which helped mount the exhibition in two converted railway arches near london 's tate modern gallery , praised davenport 's work .
breathtaking work " it 's incredibly beautiful .
it 's sublime .
everyone recognised that it 's a really beautiful piece .
" it completely takes your breath away .
" he did it on-site .
it took four days to create .
the judges recognised he normally works on canvas but this is the first time he 's done a wall drawing . "
ian davenport 's work resembles something by paul smith ms allen said the variety of the work on display and the different media used also challenged the traditional concepts of drawing .
" people normally see it as a pencil and paper but this completely blows that theory out of the water , " she added .
long produced his striking images on the back of vans by inscribing them in the dirt and exhaust deposits on the coach work .
before the announcement , he told bbc news online that he was moved to start in the unusual medium after becoming disenchanted with gallery-based projects .
intimidating art " it came to me once i 'd finished a massive conceptual exhibit at college , which took about five months .
" it was a success but it got me thinking about who actually goes to galleries .
" some people are very intimidated by the idea of going to art galleries , so i thought it might be interesting to turn things round , " he said .
having started work on vans , the submission and exhibition of the works proved to be a hurdle .
" they originally intended to put a van in the gallery .

' problematic ' videos of mr long at work were submitted instead " so i have n't taken a van away from its job " , he said .
the preservation of the designs can be problematic , but the artist claimed that unless they are washed off they can last for months .
" some van drivers have even backed two vans together to try to preserve the works , " said mr long .
organisers were impressed with long 's work and that it effectively made his art a " travelling show " and said they looked forward to seeing how he developed in the future .
there were 800 entrants and the £ 2,000 student prize was won by susan collis , 45 , who lives in london and studies at the royal college of art .

business strategies says growth rates in the north are likely to be just 0.7 % below those in the south over the coming months .
southern regions , below an imaginary line from the severn to the wash , are set to grow by an average of 2.1 % this year .
those to north are forecast to grow by 1.4 % .
the difference is the narrowest since 1995 and a significant improvement on last year 's 2.7 % gap which was the widest for more than 10 years .
the divide is expected to narrow even further in 2003 , with growth of 2.9 % in the north and 3.3 % in the south .
business strategies said the narrowing was being caused by a slowdown in household spending , which was affecting the south more than the north .

analysts had been expecting a pick-up in the economy , fuelled by the weak yen earlier in the year , but some now hope that the good news has spread from exporters into the wider economy .
a surprisingly strong 1.2 % jump in the government 's tertiary industries index in march showed service companies in the transport , telecoms and retail sectors starting to recover .
but in its monthly report , the central bank warned that the recovery could be derailed , especially by the yen , which has fluctuated wildly against the dollar this year .
at the same time as releasing its report , the bank was intervening in foreign exchange markets , in a bid to prevent the dollar falling too sharply against the yen .
feeling cheery overall , however , the bank 's report was the most optimistic it has released in years .
" the pace of deterioration in japan 's economy has moderated , with production starting to pick up , reflecting the increase in exports and progress in inventory adjustments , " the report said .
most now predict japan - mired in an all-out recession - will record strong quarter-on-quarter economic growth for the first three months of the year .
japan is due to release first-quarter gross domestic product figures on 7 june .
cheer over the country 's economic prospects helped spur a rally on the tokyo markets , with the nikkei 225 blue-chip share index closing up 160.82 points , or 1.4 % , at 11,961.98 .
ups and downs in the meantime , however , the yen has continued to seesaw , plunging early in the year , and then recovering strongly .
on wednesday , the dollar fell to a new five-month low of 123.5 yen .
according to traders , the boj started buying dollars for 125 yen late on tuesday , a relatively rare move that briefly pushed the dollar up as high as 125.02 yen .
officially , the japanese finance ministry is concerned to moderate fluctuations in the exchange rate .
but unofficially , the government is also keen to see the yen remain relatively weak , as it boosts the fortunes of exporters .

despite the uncertain outcome of the remedies proposed by merrill , industry insiders view the deal as positive because the financial impact on the firm - and the industry - for now appears limited .
the fixes include separating analysts ' pay from investment banking revenues , and a public apology .
however , the settlement allows merrill to avoid an admission of guilt , which may make it far more difficult for disgruntled investors to prove that merrill knew what it was doing in issuing conflicting stock advice .
the bank is facing up to two dozen lawsuits from investors who claim they lost money by following its investment advice .
anticipating problems probe timeline 8 april - judge orders merrill lynch to disclose conflicts of interest 17 april - merrill begins talk with attorney general 25 april - sec begins its own investigation 26 april - merrill ceo apologises for disparaging e-mails 7 may - shares of merrill trade below $ 40 , having slipped 25 % since 8 april 21 may - spitzer announces deal , calls for other brokerages to follow suit tuesday 's deal between new york state attorney general elliot spitzer and merrill lynch is unlikely to bring these investors any relief .
the settlement makes no provisions for a restitution fund - something burned investors have been pushing for - to compensate investors who lost money in following merrill 's stock recommendations - including those from former star technology analyst henry blodget .
one attorney who represents those clients says the language in the agreement is too vague for it to lead to substantial long-term changes at merrill or other brokerages .
it is still not clear , for example , if analysts will no longer be allowed to woo investment-banking business for their firms , says john allen , who represents numerous clients in a case against merrill .
" the analysts are n't going to be refrained from doing that basically until investment banking is separated by a wall that does n't have any holes in it , " he told bbc news online .
until that happens , mr allen says , " you 're going to continue to have problems " .
falling fortunes in addition to the public apology and the structural changes , merrill is also required to pay a $ 100m fine , divided nearly equally between new york and the remaining us states .
the greater cost to merrill and other investment banks , however , has been the damage the affair has done to the reputation of the brokerage business .
a drop in the share price of brokerage firms , reflecting a decline in mergers and initial public offerings since the onset of last year 's recession , has also impacted the fortunes of the industry .
merrill 's stock has followed a volatile downward path since mr spitzer announced his office had concluded a 10-month investigation into the firm 's practices last month .
from a high of $ 56 in mid-march , shares in merrill fell as low as $ 41 in early may as the company struggled to reach a settlement with the attorney general .
the share price slump has wiped about $ 10bn off merrill 's value .
on tuesday , merrill gained about 1 % to end the day at $ 43.85 , after climbing as high as $ 45.60 earlier in the day .
future litigation despite the general relief expressed among much of wall street over the deal , the banking giant can expect to spend the next five years defending itself against civil litigation brought by investors .
they cling to the hope of recouping the billions they lost in heeding merrill 's advice to invest in volatile stocks its analysts disparaged in company e-mails , but touted publicly .
while the immediate impact on the banking industry as a whole is not clear , mr spitzer on tuesday indicated he intends to vigorously pursue his investigations into other firms .
he said those firms should use merrill 's settlement as a " template " in order to make necessary changes to their research and investment banking businesses .
mr spitzer has declined to name which other firms his office is investigating , but several brokerages have indicated that they have received subpoenas from his office , including morgan stanley , credit suisse first boston , citigroup , goldman sachs and salomon smith barney .
goldman sachs has said it will review how it pays its stock analysts , acknowledging that there are problems concerning the public 's perception of wall street share-tippers .

the state department report also says that iraq " continued to provide training and political encouragement to numerous terrorist groups " .
president george w bush has repeatedly declared that countries are either " with us or against us " in the war on terror .
but this lengthy document is more about shades of grey .
seven countries are still officially designated state sponsors of terror - iran , iraq , sudan , syria , libya , north korea and cuba .
afghanistan was never an official " state sponsor " of terror , because the us did not recognise the taleban regime .
iraq singled out within the list of seven countries , both sudan and libya win muted praise for their cooperation against terrorism .
saddam hussein 's iraq did not condemn the 11 september attacks libya - long accused of being behind the lockerbie bombing more than a decade ago - has now " curtailed support for international terrorism " according to the report .
sudan is also actively working with the us to root out al-qaeda operatives the americans believe are based there .
by contrast , iraq is highlighted as the only country not to condemn the 11 september attacks .
it is also named as a host to several middle east terrorist groups .
but there is no mention of any iraqi involvement with planning 11 september .
blacklisted states iran sudan libya iraq north korea cuba syria the only hint that iraq might deserve special attention came in the comments of the secretary of state , colin powell , when he presented the report .
he said that " terrorists are trying every way they can to get their hands on weapons of mass destruction , whether radiological , chemical , biological or nuclear " .
his words will be seen as a further warning of the need to deal with iraq 's weapons capabilities .
mixed record the record of the other designated " state sponsors " is even more complex .
cuba is accused of " vacillating " in the war on terror .
north korea wins praise for condemning 11 september , but criticism for not following that up with action .
syria is once again accused of supporting various middle eastern factions - yet appears to suffer little diplomatic cost .
fidel castro 's cuba is accused of " vacillating " in the war on terror as for the al-qaeda network itself , the state department coordinator for counter-terrorism , frank taylor , said that 1,600 alleged members had been arrested in 60 countries .
but he warned that the organisation was now trying to regroup outside afghanistan .
ambassador taylor said that " additional terrorist attacks are very , very likely " .
it is clear that the rhetoric of support for the war on terror that has come from almost every country in the world has been followed by a much more mixed record of actions .

he intends to stay there for 35 hours without moving .
the 29-year-old has been called a modern day houdini for his stunts - which have included being encased in a block of ice for more than 60 hours .
blaine stood on top of a metal ball attatched to the crane which winched him high into the air .
he reached the top of the pillar that he is to call home , where there is a small platform for him to stand on .
but it is not much bigger than his feet .
the magician thanked the crowd who had turned out to cheer him on .
he says that his endurance feats in the past have been successful due to the support of his fans .
challenges in november 2000 he broke records for standing still - but that time he was encased in a block of ice .
thousands of people came to see the stunt in new york 's times square , which was inspired by the original american stuntman , harry houdini .
before that , blaine made his name for surviving a week buried in a coffin .
he says his bizarre feats are challenges - all of them rooted in his deepest fears which one by one he tries to overcome .
this time he is trying to beat his fear of heights .
but there is significant money and celebrity to be acquired - he will jump down from his lofty perch in the same way in which he was cut out of his ice block - live on prime time american television .

to be honest i think this is rubbish belgrade resident of more importance was the fact that the sun started shining again after a couple of days of rain .
people are generally fed up with america and what many see as its bullying tactics .
back in march the us announced that it would withhold aid until it was sure that the authorities in belgrade were co-operating with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
djindjic has complied with us requests for action now the us has reactivated the $ 40 million package , saying it is satisfied belgrade is now working with the hague .
in the past few weeks a number of war crimes suspects have handed themselves in .
there was no immediate official reaction in belgrade to colin powell 's announcement .
serbian prime minister zoran djindjic - in washington meeting mr powell - was certainly be pleased .
however many of his citizens are less sure .
" to be honest i think this is rubbish . "
that was the verdict of ana , a 29-year-old living in the city .
" they always promise money , but we never see it .
what we need is not one donation , but something to revive the economy . "
how do we ordinary people profit from it ?
dragan ana 's words will strike a chord with many here .
much money has been pledged by the international community over the last few years , but people have seen little change in their living circumstances .
another belgrade resident , 42 year-old dragan , summed it up nicely : " how do we ordinary people profit from it ?
it 's not that i 'm blaming the government , but little has changed .
