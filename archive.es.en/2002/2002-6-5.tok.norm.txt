program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.06.2002 fdp leader issues ultimatum to state leader in anti-semitism flap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure : an anti-semitism flap is dampening guido westerwelle 's chances for election .
the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "
beck said it was " monstrous " that the fdp is " putting words into the mouths of anti-semites .

the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "
beck said it was " monstrous " that the fdp is " putting words into the mouths of anti-semites .

environmentalists have welcomed the progress in the development of fuel cell-powered engines , which they hope will eventually replace the internal combustion engine , responsible for creating two-thirds of the world 's greenhouse gases .
how it works the fuel cell is made of two plates separated by a membrane .
oxygen and hydrogen are fed in from either side .
the membrane allows only part of the hydrogen atom , the proton , to pass through to combine with the oxygen .
the remainder of the hydrogen atom , the electron , passes via an external circuit to the oxygen side , creating electricity .
water is produced when the hydrogen and oxygen combine .
the fuel cell uses the energy in the fuel almost twice as efficiently as a normal engine .
it can also deliver electric current for air conditioning or heating systems .
unlike battery-powered electric cars , fuel cell-powered cars achieve similar ranges and load-carrying capacities to conventional cars with combustion engines .
a for endurance in the united states , daimlerchrysler 's necar 5 -lrb- new electric car -rrb- completed a thirteen-day , 4,800km endurance test drive from san francisco to washington .
the car is a mercedes-benz a class vehicle powered by a fuel cell engine which generates 75 kilowatts of power .
the hydrogen is generated onboard the car from methanol liquid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solarauto necar 5 car manufacturers involved in developing fuel cell technology hope that methanol will soon be able to be dispensed in the same way as petrol -lrb- gasoline -rrb- at pumps .
it is the first fuel in the 115-year history of the car in europe that can be produced from renewable sources .
a black day for the oil industry ?
daimlerchrysler 's necar 5 has met with the approval of several members of the united states congress who want to promote the new technology with tax incentives .
they believe fuel cell technology is not only environmentally sound , it could also reduce countries ' dependence on imported oil .
that 's important given that diminishing supplies of fossil fuels are expected to lead to higher oil prices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.06.2002 fdp leader issues ultimatum to state leader in anti-semitism flap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure : an anti-semitism flap is dampening guido westerwelle 's chances for election .
the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "
beck said it was " monstrous " that the fdp is " putting words into the mouths of anti-semites .

former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "
beck said it was " monstrous " that the fdp is " putting words into the mouths of anti-semites .

the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.06.2002 fdp leader issues ultimatum to state leader in anti-semitism flap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure : an anti-semitism flap is dampening guido westerwelle 's chances for election .
the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "
beck said it was " monstrous " that the fdp is " putting words into the mouths of anti-semites .

the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .

environmentalists have welcomed the progress in the development of fuel cell-powered engines , which they hope will eventually replace the internal combustion engine , responsible for creating two-thirds of the world 's greenhouse gases .
how it works the fuel cell is made of two plates separated by a membrane .
oxygen and hydrogen are fed in from either side .
the membrane allows only part of the hydrogen atom , the proton , to pass through to combine with the oxygen .
the remainder of the hydrogen atom , the electron , passes via an external circuit to the oxygen side , creating electricity .
water is produced when the hydrogen and oxygen combine .
the fuel cell uses the energy in the fuel almost twice as efficiently as a normal engine .
it can also deliver electric current for air conditioning or heating systems .
unlike battery-powered electric cars , fuel cell-powered cars achieve similar ranges and load-carrying capacities to conventional cars with combustion engines .
a for endurance in the united states , daimlerchrysler 's necar 5 -lrb- new electric car -rrb- completed a thirteen-day , 4,800km endurance test drive from san francisco to washington .
the car is a mercedes-benz a class vehicle powered by a fuel cell engine which generates 75 kilowatts of power .
the hydrogen is generated onboard the car from methanol liquid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solarauto necar 5 car manufacturers involved in developing fuel cell technology hope that methanol will soon be able to be dispensed in the same way as petrol -lrb- gasoline -rrb- at pumps .
it is the first fuel in the 115-year history of the car in europe that can be produced from renewable sources .
a black day for the oil industry ?
daimlerchrysler 's necar 5 has met with the approval of several members of the united states congress who want to promote the new technology with tax incentives .
they believe fuel cell technology is not only environmentally sound , it could also reduce countries ' dependence on imported oil .
that 's important given that diminishing supplies of fossil fuels are expected to lead to higher oil prices .
daimlerchrysler , which has announced it will co-operate with other german car manufacturers bmw , opel and ford to develop alternative power-production sites , plans to have fuel cell-powered passenger vehicles on the market by 2004 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links solarserver germany background information on fuel cell technology daimlerchrysler fuel cell technology manufacturer information on the necar 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "
beck said it was " monstrous " that the fdp is " putting words into the mouths of anti-semites .

environmentalists have welcomed the progress in the development of fuel cell-powered engines , which they hope will eventually replace the internal combustion engine , responsible for creating two-thirds of the world 's greenhouse gases .
how it works the fuel cell is made of two plates separated by a membrane .
oxygen and hydrogen are fed in from either side .
the membrane allows only part of the hydrogen atom , the proton , to pass through to combine with the oxygen .
the remainder of the hydrogen atom , the electron , passes via an external circuit to the oxygen side , creating electricity .
water is produced when the hydrogen and oxygen combine .
the fuel cell uses the energy in the fuel almost twice as efficiently as a normal engine .
it can also deliver electric current for air conditioning or heating systems .
unlike battery-powered electric cars , fuel cell-powered cars achieve similar ranges and load-carrying capacities to conventional cars with combustion engines .
a for endurance in the united states , daimlerchrysler 's necar 5 -lrb- new electric car -rrb- completed a thirteen-day , 4,800km endurance test drive from san francisco to washington .
the car is a mercedes-benz a class vehicle powered by a fuel cell engine which generates 75 kilowatts of power .
the hydrogen is generated onboard the car from methanol liquid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solarauto necar 5 car manufacturers involved in developing fuel cell technology hope that methanol will soon be able to be dispensed in the same way as petrol -lrb- gasoline -rrb- at pumps .

the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "
beck said it was " monstrous " that the fdp is " putting words into the mouths of anti-semites .

the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "

" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .

spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .

the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "

the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "

environmentalists have welcomed the progress in the development of fuel cell-powered engines , which they hope will eventually replace the internal combustion engine , responsible for creating two-thirds of the world 's greenhouse gases .
how it works the fuel cell is made of two plates separated by a membrane .
oxygen and hydrogen are fed in from either side .
the membrane allows only part of the hydrogen atom , the proton , to pass through to combine with the oxygen .
the remainder of the hydrogen atom , the electron , passes via an external circuit to the oxygen side , creating electricity .
water is produced when the hydrogen and oxygen combine .
the fuel cell uses the energy in the fuel almost twice as efficiently as a normal engine .
it can also deliver electric current for air conditioning or heating systems .
unlike battery-powered electric cars , fuel cell-powered cars achieve similar ranges and load-carrying capacities to conventional cars with combustion engines .
a for endurance in the united states , daimlerchrysler 's necar 5 -lrb- new electric car -rrb- completed a thirteen-day , 4,800km endurance test drive from san francisco to washington .
the car is a mercedes-benz a class vehicle powered by a fuel cell engine which generates 75 kilowatts of power .

it is the first fuel in the 115-year history of the car in europe that can be produced from renewable sources .
a black day for the oil industry ?
daimlerchrysler 's necar 5 has met with the approval of several members of the united states congress who want to promote the new technology with tax incentives .
they believe fuel cell technology is not only environmentally sound , it could also reduce countries ' dependence on imported oil .
that 's important given that diminishing supplies of fossil fuels are expected to lead to higher oil prices .

the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "
beck said it was " monstrous " that the fdp is " putting words into the mouths of anti-semites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.06.2002 fdp leader issues ultimatum to state leader in anti-semitism flap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure : an anti-semitism flap is dampening guido westerwelle 's chances for election .
the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .

seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .

the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "
beck said it was " monstrous " that the fdp is " putting words into the mouths of anti-semites .

the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "
beck said it was " monstrous " that the fdp is " putting words into the mouths of anti-semites .

environmentalists have welcomed the progress in the development of fuel cell-powered engines , which they hope will eventually replace the internal combustion engine , responsible for creating two-thirds of the world 's greenhouse gases .
how it works the fuel cell is made of two plates separated by a membrane .
oxygen and hydrogen are fed in from either side .
the membrane allows only part of the hydrogen atom , the proton , to pass through to combine with the oxygen .
the remainder of the hydrogen atom , the electron , passes via an external circuit to the oxygen side , creating electricity .
water is produced when the hydrogen and oxygen combine .
the fuel cell uses the energy in the fuel almost twice as efficiently as a normal engine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.06.2002 fdp leader issues ultimatum to state leader in anti-semitism flap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under pressure : an anti-semitism flap is dampening guido westerwelle 's chances for election .
the german parliament and the leader of the free democratic party on wednesday sought to rein in a growing spat between party leaders and germany 's leading jewish group over allegations of anti-semitism in the fdp . fdp chairman guido westerwelle issued an ultimatum to his party chief in north rhine-westphalia on wednesday , saying that if jamal karsli is not removed from the fdp 's group in the state parliament by monday he would no longer " work together " with state party chief jürgen möllemann .
for days now , westerwelle has been seeking to find a way to eliminate karsli while still retaining möllemann , his state party chief and political protege .
möllemann has been under fire for comments he made in defense of syrian-born karsli , who sought to join the liberal fdp after bolting from the green party because he believed it had become too pro-israel in its policies .
in a shrill exchange of salvos , möllemann accused michel friedman , vice president of the central council of jews and a prominent figure in german media , of fueling the spread of anti-semitism in germany with his " intolerant , hateful style . "
despite massive pressure from within the party and without , möllemann has steadfastly refused to apologize for his attack or remove karsli .
" a problem for the fdp " earlier this week the central council of jews ' president , paul spiegel , said the dispute between his organization and möllemann was final , and that it had now become a " problem for the fdp . "
" we 're not going to beg for an apology , " spiegel told the " financial times deutschland " newspaper .
" to regret a misunderstanding is n't enough .
there were no misunderstandings - there was an insult . "
spiegel described möllemann 's statements as the greatest insult to german jews since 1945 .
former council chairman ignatz bubis , also a prominent member of the fdp , would " role over in his grave if he heard the voices inside his party today , " he said .
wednesday 's ultimatum marks a total shift to for westerwelle , who had been supportive of möllemann until a special party meeting in düsseldorf whereby möllemann and other members of the state party group voted to allow the politically independent karsli to continue to sit with them in the state legislature .
they did so on the condition that karsli would not make any more statements that could be perceived as anti-israel or anti-semitic .
an outspoken critic karsli has been an outspoken opponent of israel ’ s occupation of the palestinian territories .
in an interview published in a right-wing german newspaper , karsli compared the israeli government ’ s offensive in the west bank to the nazis .
in another interview , he criticized the media influence of the " zionist lobby " in germany for presenting a one-sided view of the violence in the middle east .
when he originally requested permission to join the fdp , many in the party rejected him for his strong anti-israel statements ; some even cautioned that karsli was anti-semitic .
but möllemann , who is also the head of the german-arab society , stood steadfastly behind karsli and defended him and the freedom to criticize israel in several public statements .
the political frenzy over karsli and möllemann has come at a difficult time for the fdp , which is seeking to become a coalition partner in the german government after the september 22 elections .
the party , with westerwelle as its chancellor candidate , is seeking 18 percent of the vote and had indeed seen its fortunes rise in public opinion polls until the allegations of anti-semitism arose .
westerwelle has argued that statements critical of the israeli government should not be reflexively labeled as anti-semitic .
nevertheless , the latest poll by the forsa institute suggests that the public is n't buying his argument .
for the first time since april , the fdp has fallen below the 10 percent mark , with a three-point drop in the latest survey .
parliament : is the fdp anti-semitic ?
seeking to stave off growing international concern about an alleged upswing in anti-semitic sentiment , the bundestag , germany 's parliament , took up the issue on wednesday .
during the special hearing , the social democrats and the greens , who lead a coalition government , accused the fdp of veering onto a right-wing course - a charge that westerwelle vociferously denied .
westerwelle said his party had been centrist for decades and planned stay that way .
he also accused the coalition of conducting a cheap " smear campaign " against the fdp .
the former chairman of the christian democratic union , wolfgang schäuble said there was no suspicion that the fdp had become a party doing trade in anti-semitism , and warned against " exaggeration " of the issue .
" i do n't believe that anti-semitism has a chance in germany , " schäuble said .
" nor should it ever be given another chance in germany . "
however , volker beck , the greens ' spokesman for legal issues , said the bundestag debate was necessary .
" the bundestag ca n't remain silent when the central council of jews in germany feels it has been left alone at a time when threats against jews are growing at a worrying rate . "
beck said it was " monstrous " that the fdp is " putting words into the mouths of anti-semites .

the research could lead to a screening test for testicular cancer , and to new treatments .
a team from duke university medical center in north carolina has found that men who inherit an overactive form of a gene called hiwi are at increased risk of developing the disease .
this is the first study to establish a high level correlation between a gene and seminoma dr haifan lin they are particularly at risk of a form of testicular cancer called seminoma , which originates in the reproductive cells .
researcher dr haifan lin , who discovered the hiwi gene in 1997 , found that seminoma tumours contained reproductive cells in which the gene was up to 16 times more active than normal .
this appeared to be linked to the accelerated cell multiplication associated with cancer .
significant findings dr lin admits that the study only focused on a small number of patients , but he said the findings were significant .
twelve out of 19 patients -lrb- 63 % -rrb- showed evidence of an overactive hiwi gene .
he said : " this is the first study to establish a high level correlation between a gene and seminoma . "
although hiwi is the first gene known to be highly correlated to seminoma , scientists are close to identifying other genes suspected of playing a role in other testicular cancers .
in february 2000 , cancer uk researchers announced they had located , but not yet identified , a gene on a region of chromosome x that is associated with testicular cancer .
the gene , tgct1 , can increase a men 's risk of testicular cancer by up to 50 times .
dr lin suspects that an under active hiwi gene may be linked to sterility in men .
testicular cancer is the most common form of cancer in caucasian men between the ages of 15 and 45 .
the research is published in the journal oncogene .

although ibm has weathered the tech downturn better than many of its rivals , chief executive sam palmisano is struggling to reverse a 33 % drop in its share price this year .
earlier on tuesday , the firm said it had cut 1,500 microelectronics jobs , the latest in an ongoing programme of reductions of its 300,000-strong workforce .
previously , the firm said it was selling its loss-making hard disk drive business to hitachi for $ 2bn , transferring 18,000 workers to the new company .
cutting costs ibm 's announcement was taken as a positive sign , indicating that the firm was not prepared to let its business be eaten away by the market slowdown .
" -lsb- ibm -rsb- need to resize the business for the current level of demand , " said victory capital analyst marty shagrin .
overall , the firm is aiming to cut close to 10,000 jobs , many of which have already been eliminated .
ibm will also close older aluminium technology capacity for microchips and focus on copper technology , increasing its custom chip design business .
full disclosure chief financial officer john joyce said that the sale of the disk drive business would benefit ibm this year , but refused to speculate on the precise effect on performance .
" there 's no point in trying to update those full year expectations after just six weeks , " he said .
" but these actions we announced today put us in a better competitive position for the second half as well as 2003 . "
ibm has come in for criticism over its failure to disclose financial information , as investors became jittery in the wake of enron 's collapse .
the latest announcement is part of its pledge to increase disclosure .

shrugging off talk of a slowdown , australian gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- grew by an annual 4.2 % in the first three months of the year , one of the strongest performances among large developed economies .
the reserve bank of australia , which warned last month that interest rates would have to keep on rising to check overheating , added another quarter-point , taking its key rate to 4.75 % .
the bank said it was concerned that inflation , although not yet rampant , was creeping towards the top of its target range , as consumer spending continued to grow unchecked .
foot on the brakes the latest gdp figure came in a little below expectations , but analysts pointed out that this was in large part due to a sharp fall in public investment .
with that investment due to speed up later in the year , the reserve bank foresaw a need to keep its foot on the monetary brakes .
last year , the bank cut borrowing costs by a total of 200 basis points , something that helped fuel a runaway housing market and strong consumer sentiment .
against that backdrop , the bank 's warnings on future rate rises were not universally welcome .
" australian growth remains robust but the purpose of interest rate rises is to slow that growth down , " said phil naylor , chief executive of the australian retailers association .
way to go a week ago , reserve bank governor ian macfarlane told a parliamentary committee that he saw a neutral real interest rate setting at 3-3.5 % , equivalent to a cash rate of about 5.5-6 % .
other economies - including new zealand , canada and sweden - have started raising rates this year , and the uk , us and europe are expected to follow suit later in the year .
as well as calming growth domestically , higher australian interest rates should help boost the australian dollar , which could benefit from a weakening us currency .
a stronger australian dollar will , however , hit some of the country 's key commodity export sectors .

the three-day africa economic summit which opens on wednesday will tackle africa 's home-grown recovery plan , known as nepad , which targets increased foreign investment and better economic growth .
the african nations have received the backing of the world bank president , james wolfensohn .
in a speech on tuesday , mr wolfensohn urged the world 's richest nations to lower their trade barriers to african exports .
he also called on rich countries to pledge that more than half of the new aid promised at the monterrey conference in march will go to africa .
" give us market access ; give us a level playing field for our products and goods ; give us a trade partnership that is more than just in name , " said mr wolfensohn .
" that is what -lsb- african -rsb- leaders are saying .
is anyone listening ? "
fighting poverty nepad -lrb- new partnership for africa 's development -rrb- will take centre stage at the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialised nations in canada next month .
" there has never been a better time for africa to restate its case , louder than ever , that it is ready for change and open for business , " said haiko alfeld , director for africa at the world economic forum -lrb- wef -rrb- .
" the window of opportunity presented by the nepad is matched by an unprecedented global commitment to fight poverty and inequality . "
the international community must help , mr wolfensohn agreed , though africa would also have to pull its weight .
" african countries need to follow through on the nepad agenda and work to break down internal barriers to trade and investment that limit the ability of farmers to market their goods within africa , " he said .
all ears nepad says it hopes the summit will provide frank discussion between africa , its international partners , business and civil society .
more than 750 participants from 48 countries have gathered in durban , including south africa 's thabo mbeki and nigeria 's president olusegun obasanjo .
nepad founding countries algeria egypt nigeria senegal south africa more than half of the attendees are business leaders , drawn principally from the forum 's members - 1,000 of the world 's leading companies .
the annual meet has often been criticised for being an ineffectual talking-shop .
this year , the group has stressed its intentions to set out concrete steps for action and to listen to business leaders .
" business would like to draw the debate down to shorter-term , practical issues - like what it can do to contribute to fighting corruption , " said michael spicer , spokesman for mining giant anglo-american .
the cost of failure the summit will focus on what africa will deliver through nepad in terms of good governance , peace and security .
when nepad was unveiled , in july , africa had already suffered a decline in prosperity which had seen 34 of the continent 's nations ranked among the world 's least developed countries , compared with 27 in 1996 .
development aid to africa fell from $ 24.2bn to $ 14.2bn between 1989 and 1999 , while the united nations said that foreign investment had been set to fall by 40 % even before the 11 september attacks on the us .
" we must grasp this opportunity , " nepad strategy documents said .
" we can not afford to fail . "
the nepad plan has come out of africa , and is based largely on ideas drawn up separately by mr mbeki with senegalese president abdoulaye wade and nigeria 's olusegun obasanjo .
african leaders are hoping to win yearly investments of $ 64bn for africa , enabling annual economic growth of 7 % .

j sainsbury , debenhams , bp and barclaycard are to transfer their in-company loyalty schemes to a joint programme launched this autumn , a statement on wednesday said .
the joint card , called nectar , will be run by air miles founder keith mills , and is expected to sign-up half of uk households .
the card will be useable at 1,800 stores run by the four firms , with further retailers expected to join the programme in the future .
points will be exchangeable for " rewards " such as consumer goods , flights , holidays , meals and cinema tickets .
points fatigue the move represents a u-turn for the uk retail sector , which in recent years has moved away from loyalty cards , over concerns that they fail to attract new customers .
supermarket giant safeway two years ago famously scrapped its loyalty card programme , claiming customers preferred immediate discounts to points .
" people have lost interest in -lsb- loyalty card -rsb- points and do n't think they give value , " chief executive carlos criado-perez said at the time .
cost savings but sainsbury last week revealed the value of a successful loyalty card scheme by admitting that the loss of its air miles offer to rival supermarket giant tesco had hit sales growth .
and the joint card it designed to see points rack up more quickly , encouraging participation , besides helping the four retailers cut the cost of administrating their stand-alone schemes .
" in the new scheme , our customers will be able to earn points faster from a larger number of retailers , accessing a greater value of rewards , " bp retail chief graham sims said .
nectar will be run by the uk arm of mr mills ' loyalty management international firm , which is reported to be preparing to spend £ 50m launching nectar . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jenny scott " sainsbury 's are clearly hoping to fight back " keith mills , lmuk " the number of rewards will be substantially broader " see also : 29 may 02 -pipe- business sainsbury recovers sales and profits 01 may 02 -pipe- business co-op revives the ' divi ' 15 mar 02 -pipe- business tesco offers air miles 09 jan 02 -pipe- business lack of discounts hits iceland trade top business stories now : hacker breaches credit card security job losses escalate at reuters new sec chief pledges tough line oil prices push higher rwanda denies drc plundering overseas sales drive wal-mart congo 's finance minister resigns blair keeps euro options open links to more business stories are at the foot of the page .

he applied the emergency brake , but could not stop the train in time .
leg injuries twenty-one people , including the driver , were on board the three carriages when they were derailed .

ms jowell said the prospect of funding the corporation without the licence fee lay " somewhere between the improbable and the impossible " .
in an interview with the financial times newspaper she appeared to rule out a radical overhaul in the bbc 's funding .
her comments sparked fury from shadow culture secretary , tim yeo , who branded them " absolutely astonishing " .
the bbc is overwhelmingly funded by the £ 2.3bn a year it receives from tv households paying a £ 109 licence fee .
this is secure until 2006 when the corporation 's current charter expires .
the government has indicated that between 2004 and end of the current charter it will consider alternative funding .
options could include privatisation , subscription charges for viewers or turning the bbc into a mutual society .
but ms jowell 's comments indicate the government will not pursue these , favouring the renewal of the charter for a further 10 years .
ms jowell told the newspaper she is proud of the bbc as a trusted broadcaster and the role it played in the queen 's golden jubilee .
opposition critical " when i say that this is a no holds barred charter renewal , it 's a renewal not a deconstruction -lsb- of the bbc -rsb- , " she said .
" the prospect of the uk without the bbc funded by the licence fee is anywhere between improbable to impossible because the bbc is one of the most loved and trusted uk institutions . "
" the present licence fee is effectively a tv tax and it 's an odd one because everyone has to pay it even if they never watch the bbc " tim yeo but ms jowell said she did not want to predict the outcome of a study which would involve widespread consultation with media executives .
her comments infuriated mr yeo , who said they made a mockery of the impending review of the charter .
" in the 10 years since the last charter renewal the whole television and broadcasting sector has changed radically , " he told the newspaper .
" to simply dismiss the alternative possibilities before the debate has taken place not only shows a closed mind but may also work against the interests of viewers and broadcasters . "
pay for view mr yeo told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " the present licence fee is effectively a tv tax and it 's an odd one because everyone has to pay it even if they never watch the bbc or listen to the radio programmes . "
one alternative to the current system might be a lower licence fee with viewers being able to tap into bbc programmes on either a subscription or pay for view basis , he said .
" imagine what this would do for the bbc .
it would open up all sorts of opportunities that have been up to now denied it .
" they are constantly constrained by the terms of the present charter , " he added .
jocelyn hay , chairwoman of the voice of the listeners and viewers association , welcomed ms jowell 's words .
" it is absolutely essential that we keep the stability of the bbc and its funding in place , " she said .
a bbc spokesman said : " we welcome the secretary of state 's continuing support for the licence fee , which we believe is the best way of funding the bbc . "
