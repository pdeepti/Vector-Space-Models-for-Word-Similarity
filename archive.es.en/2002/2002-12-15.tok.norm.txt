it was once again michael schumacher 's year .
the german formula one ace left everyone else choking on his exhaust fumes as he romped home to claim his fifth world championship title .
the german anthem rang out and the flag was raised so often during his latest record breaking season , he might as well have been racing at home every time .

golden haul crowns winter olympic successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic gold medallist claudia pechstein from a one man winning machine to a team effort worthy of praise .
germany went to salt lake city in the united states for the winter olympics and came home as the medal league 's top outfit .
the skaters , the skiers , the toboganists - in every event , german athletes combined in an astonishing performance that pipped the home country to the top spot by one medal .
there were many heroes , including claudia pechstein , the east german speed skating star who took home 2 gold medals in the 5000 meter and 3000 meter disciplines , in which she broke her own world record .
further olympic success came in the form of the german paralympic team who collected a total of 17 gold medals in their winter games and finished ahead of the pack in the race for medals .
dogged approach takes soccer team to world cup final from the snow and ice of salt lake city to the oppressive heat and monsoon storms of japan and korea .
state-of-the-art soccer stadiums , fanatical supporters and the world 's best teams combined to make the first asian world cup finals a colorful success .
to everyone 's surprise , including their own , the german national eleven overcame a crisis of belief to reach the final .
at times it was not pretty to watch , at others a delight but through sheer determination , typical german efficiency and more than a hint of luck , rudi völler 's boys battered their way to yokohama to face the brazilians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national soccer team celebrate on their return .
unfortunately , their luck ran out in the form of a rejuvenated ronaldo , scoring twice past a despairing oliver kahn to clinch the title for the south americans .
the german team , however , still came home to a hero 's reception .
german domestic football could also hold its head high despite falling at the last hurdle .
both bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund took the bundesliga to the pinnacle of the european stage by reaching the finals of the european champions league and uefa cup respectively .
leverkusen , after stomping on a number of prestigious reputations on the way , lost to real madrid while dortmund 's dominant run unraveled against psv eindhoven .
franzi leads by example as swimmers clean up at home as well as claiming victories across the globe , germany commanded in their own backyard .
at the european swimming championships in berlin , the germans won a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .
no other country came close to germany ’ s medal tally as the team advanced to the status of europe 's number 1 nation in swimming and diving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franziska van almsick tests the gold .
the championships heralded the return to form of german swimming sensation franziska van almsick who collected a personal horde of 5 gold medals while setting two new world records .
after poor form , injuries and personal problems , ' franzi ' was back as the darling of the german public .
elsewhere , the german basketball team astounded everyone by coming third in the world championships and the handball team went one further by finishing as runners-up in their competition .
more to come ?
so whatever the next year may bring in terms of the economy , unemployment and political upheaval , the germans can look forward to another year of sporting achievements .
it could be the 771 million euro -lrb- $ 790m -rrb- investment in sport by the government ; it may be the fruit of the east / west reunion or it may be just the germans habit of not giving up - whatever inspired the sports stars of germany to such success in 2002 , it is unlikely to dwindle away again in the coming year .

but if they 're looking for rays of sunshine in a year that saw the literal black clouds of torrential rain and the figurative ones of economic recession loom over them , they can bask in the knowledge that their sportsmen and women stockpiled honors around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schummi celebrates his fifth world title .
it was once again michael schumacher 's year .
the german formula one ace left everyone else choking on his exhaust fumes as he romped home to claim his fifth world championship title .
the german anthem rang out and the flag was raised so often during his latest record breaking season , he might as well have been racing at home every time .
schummi took the checkered flag on an astounding 11 occasions throughout the season , wrapping the championship up with races to spare .
if the car continues to perform well next time out , who would bet against michael enjoying numerous champagne showers on the way to his sixth title ?
maybe his ever improving brother ralph will have something to say about that ... and let 's not forget , he 's german too of course .
golden haul crowns winter olympic successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic gold medallist claudia pechstein from a one man winning machine to a team effort worthy of praise .
germany went to salt lake city in the united states for the winter olympics and came home as the medal league 's top outfit .
the skaters , the skiers , the toboganists - in every event , german athletes combined in an astonishing performance that pipped the home country to the top spot by one medal .
there were many heroes , including claudia pechstein , the east german speed skating star who took home 2 gold medals in the 5000 meter and 3000 meter disciplines , in which she broke her own world record .
further olympic success came in the form of the german paralympic team who collected a total of 17 gold medals in their winter games and finished ahead of the pack in the race for medals .
dogged approach takes soccer team to world cup final from the snow and ice of salt lake city to the oppressive heat and monsoon storms of japan and korea .
state-of-the-art soccer stadiums , fanatical supporters and the world 's best teams combined to make the first asian world cup finals a colorful success .
to everyone 's surprise , including their own , the german national eleven overcame a crisis of belief to reach the final .
at times it was not pretty to watch , at others a delight but through sheer determination , typical german efficiency and more than a hint of luck , rudi völler 's boys battered their way to yokohama to face the brazilians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national soccer team celebrate on their return .
unfortunately , their luck ran out in the form of a rejuvenated ronaldo , scoring twice past a despairing oliver kahn to clinch the title for the south americans .
the german team , however , still came home to a hero 's reception .
german domestic football could also hold its head high despite falling at the last hurdle .
both bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund took the bundesliga to the pinnacle of the european stage by reaching the finals of the european champions league and uefa cup respectively .
leverkusen , after stomping on a number of prestigious reputations on the way , lost to real madrid while dortmund 's dominant run unraveled against psv eindhoven .
franzi leads by example as swimmers clean up at home as well as claiming victories across the globe , germany commanded in their own backyard .
at the european swimming championships in berlin , the germans won a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .
no other country came close to germany ’ s medal tally as the team advanced to the status of europe 's number 1 nation in swimming and diving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franziska van almsick tests the gold .
the championships heralded the return to form of german swimming sensation franziska van almsick who collected a personal horde of 5 gold medals while setting two new world records .
after poor form , injuries and personal problems , ' franzi ' was back as the darling of the german public .
elsewhere , the german basketball team astounded everyone by coming third in the world championships and the handball team went one further by finishing as runners-up in their competition .
more to come ?
so whatever the next year may bring in terms of the economy , unemployment and political upheaval , the germans can look forward to another year of sporting achievements .
it could be the 771 million euro -lrb- $ 790m -rrb- investment in sport by the government ; it may be the fruit of the east / west reunion or it may be just the germans habit of not giving up - whatever inspired the sports stars of germany to such success in 2002 , it is unlikely to dwindle away again in the coming year .

golden haul crowns winter olympic successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic gold medallist claudia pechstein from a one man winning machine to a team effort worthy of praise .
germany went to salt lake city in the united states for the winter olympics and came home as the medal league 's top outfit .
the skaters , the skiers , the toboganists - in every event , german athletes combined in an astonishing performance that pipped the home country to the top spot by one medal .
there were many heroes , including claudia pechstein , the east german speed skating star who took home 2 gold medals in the 5000 meter and 3000 meter disciplines , in which she broke her own world record .
further olympic success came in the form of the german paralympic team who collected a total of 17 gold medals in their winter games and finished ahead of the pack in the race for medals .
dogged approach takes soccer team to world cup final from the snow and ice of salt lake city to the oppressive heat and monsoon storms of japan and korea .
state-of-the-art soccer stadiums , fanatical supporters and the world 's best teams combined to make the first asian world cup finals a colorful success .
to everyone 's surprise , including their own , the german national eleven overcame a crisis of belief to reach the final .
at times it was not pretty to watch , at others a delight but through sheer determination , typical german efficiency and more than a hint of luck , rudi völler 's boys battered their way to yokohama to face the brazilians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national soccer team celebrate on their return .
unfortunately , their luck ran out in the form of a rejuvenated ronaldo , scoring twice past a despairing oliver kahn to clinch the title for the south americans .
the german team , however , still came home to a hero 's reception .
german domestic football could also hold its head high despite falling at the last hurdle .
both bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund took the bundesliga to the pinnacle of the european stage by reaching the finals of the european champions league and uefa cup respectively .
leverkusen , after stomping on a number of prestigious reputations on the way , lost to real madrid while dortmund 's dominant run unraveled against psv eindhoven .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franziska van almsick tests the gold .
the championships heralded the return to form of german swimming sensation franziska van almsick who collected a personal horde of 5 gold medals while setting two new world records .
after poor form , injuries and personal problems , ' franzi ' was back as the darling of the german public .
elsewhere , the german basketball team astounded everyone by coming third in the world championships and the handball team went one further by finishing as runners-up in their competition .

golden haul crowns winter olympic successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic gold medallist claudia pechstein from a one man winning machine to a team effort worthy of praise .
germany went to salt lake city in the united states for the winter olympics and came home as the medal league 's top outfit .
the skaters , the skiers , the toboganists - in every event , german athletes combined in an astonishing performance that pipped the home country to the top spot by one medal .
there were many heroes , including claudia pechstein , the east german speed skating star who took home 2 gold medals in the 5000 meter and 3000 meter disciplines , in which she broke her own world record .
further olympic success came in the form of the german paralympic team who collected a total of 17 gold medals in their winter games and finished ahead of the pack in the race for medals .
dogged approach takes soccer team to world cup final from the snow and ice of salt lake city to the oppressive heat and monsoon storms of japan and korea .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national soccer team celebrate on their return .
unfortunately , their luck ran out in the form of a rejuvenated ronaldo , scoring twice past a despairing oliver kahn to clinch the title for the south americans .
the german team , however , still came home to a hero 's reception .
german domestic football could also hold its head high despite falling at the last hurdle .
both bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund took the bundesliga to the pinnacle of the european stage by reaching the finals of the european champions league and uefa cup respectively .
leverkusen , after stomping on a number of prestigious reputations on the way , lost to real madrid while dortmund 's dominant run unraveled against psv eindhoven .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franziska van almsick tests the gold .
the championships heralded the return to form of german swimming sensation franziska van almsick who collected a personal horde of 5 gold medals while setting two new world records .
after poor form , injuries and personal problems , ' franzi ' was back as the darling of the german public .

but if they 're looking for rays of sunshine in a year that saw the literal black clouds of torrential rain and the figurative ones of economic recession loom over them , they can bask in the knowledge that their sportsmen and women stockpiled honors around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schummi celebrates his fifth world title .
it was once again michael schumacher 's year .
the german formula one ace left everyone else choking on his exhaust fumes as he romped home to claim his fifth world championship title .
the german anthem rang out and the flag was raised so often during his latest record breaking season , he might as well have been racing at home every time .
schummi took the checkered flag on an astounding 11 occasions throughout the season , wrapping the championship up with races to spare .
if the car continues to perform well next time out , who would bet against michael enjoying numerous champagne showers on the way to his sixth title ?
maybe his ever improving brother ralph will have something to say about that ... and let 's not forget , he 's german too of course .
golden haul crowns winter olympic successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic gold medallist claudia pechstein from a one man winning machine to a team effort worthy of praise .
germany went to salt lake city in the united states for the winter olympics and came home as the medal league 's top outfit .
the skaters , the skiers , the toboganists - in every event , german athletes combined in an astonishing performance that pipped the home country to the top spot by one medal .
there were many heroes , including claudia pechstein , the east german speed skating star who took home 2 gold medals in the 5000 meter and 3000 meter disciplines , in which she broke her own world record .
further olympic success came in the form of the german paralympic team who collected a total of 17 gold medals in their winter games and finished ahead of the pack in the race for medals .
dogged approach takes soccer team to world cup final from the snow and ice of salt lake city to the oppressive heat and monsoon storms of japan and korea .
state-of-the-art soccer stadiums , fanatical supporters and the world 's best teams combined to make the first asian world cup finals a colorful success .
to everyone 's surprise , including their own , the german national eleven overcame a crisis of belief to reach the final .
at times it was not pretty to watch , at others a delight but through sheer determination , typical german efficiency and more than a hint of luck , rudi völler 's boys battered their way to yokohama to face the brazilians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national soccer team celebrate on their return .
unfortunately , their luck ran out in the form of a rejuvenated ronaldo , scoring twice past a despairing oliver kahn to clinch the title for the south americans .
the german team , however , still came home to a hero 's reception .
german domestic football could also hold its head high despite falling at the last hurdle .
both bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund took the bundesliga to the pinnacle of the european stage by reaching the finals of the european champions league and uefa cup respectively .
leverkusen , after stomping on a number of prestigious reputations on the way , lost to real madrid while dortmund 's dominant run unraveled against psv eindhoven .
franzi leads by example as swimmers clean up at home as well as claiming victories across the globe , germany commanded in their own backyard .
at the european swimming championships in berlin , the germans won a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .
no other country came close to germany ’ s medal tally as the team advanced to the status of europe 's number 1 nation in swimming and diving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franziska van almsick tests the gold .
the championships heralded the return to form of german swimming sensation franziska van almsick who collected a personal horde of 5 gold medals while setting two new world records .
after poor form , injuries and personal problems , ' franzi ' was back as the darling of the german public .
elsewhere , the german basketball team astounded everyone by coming third in the world championships and the handball team went one further by finishing as runners-up in their competition .
more to come ?
so whatever the next year may bring in terms of the economy , unemployment and political upheaval , the germans can look forward to another year of sporting achievements .
it could be the 771 million euro -lrb- $ 790m -rrb- investment in sport by the government ; it may be the fruit of the east / west reunion or it may be just the germans habit of not giving up - whatever inspired the sports stars of germany to such success in 2002 , it is unlikely to dwindle away again in the coming year .

in the article , it is suggested that german ships , as part of the nato force currently based in the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea , could be enrolled to escort the us fleet carrying troops or supplies towards iraq in the event of war .

on wednesday , chancellor gerhard schroeder said he would allow german air personnel to crew awacs surveillance aircraft in the event of war on iraq as long as they were seen to be involved in a nato support role only .

campaign promises are broken again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder inspects german troops in kabul .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national soccer team celebrate on their return .
unfortunately , their luck ran out in the form of a rejuvenated ronaldo , scoring twice past a despairing oliver kahn to clinch the title for the south americans .
the german team , however , still came home to a hero 's reception .
german domestic football could also hold its head high despite falling at the last hurdle .
both bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund took the bundesliga to the pinnacle of the european stage by reaching the finals of the european champions league and uefa cup respectively .
leverkusen , after stomping on a number of prestigious reputations on the way , lost to real madrid while dortmund 's dominant run unraveled against psv eindhoven .
franzi leads by example as swimmers clean up at home as well as claiming victories across the globe , germany commanded in their own backyard .
at the european swimming championships in berlin , the germans won a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .
no other country came close to germany ’ s medal tally as the team advanced to the status of europe 's number 1 nation in swimming and diving .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franziska van almsick tests the gold .
the championships heralded the return to form of german swimming sensation franziska van almsick who collected a personal horde of 5 gold medals while setting two new world records .
after poor form , injuries and personal problems , ' franzi ' was back as the darling of the german public .
elsewhere , the german basketball team astounded everyone by coming third in the world championships and the handball team went one further by finishing as runners-up in their competition .
more to come ?
so whatever the next year may bring in terms of the economy , unemployment and political upheaval , the germans can look forward to another year of sporting achievements .
it could be the 771 million euro -lrb- $ 790m -rrb- investment in sport by the government ; it may be the fruit of the east / west reunion or it may be just the germans habit of not giving up - whatever inspired the sports stars of germany to such success in 2002 , it is unlikely to dwindle away again in the coming year .

further olympic success came in the form of the german paralympic team who collected a total of 17 gold medals in their winter games and finished ahead of the pack in the race for medals .

in the article , it is suggested that german ships , as part of the nato force currently based in the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea , could be enrolled to escort the us fleet carrying troops or supplies towards iraq in the event of war .
die welt reported that such assistance has already been requested in an " unofficial manner " by washington .
struck says marines are in no danger of involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck .
defense minister peter struck said in an updated statement on the newspaper 's web site that " german marine soldiers are in no danger of involvement in any possible iraq conflict . "
on wednesday , chancellor gerhard schroeder said he would allow german air personnel to crew awacs surveillance aircraft in the event of war on iraq as long as they were seen to be involved in a nato support role only .
it was an apparent softening of the german government 's previous hardline opposition to any role in a us-led offensive against saddam hussein 's regime .
" our alliance obligations will be met , but germany will not take part in any military intervention , " he told german television .
campaign promises are broken again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroeder inspects german troops in kabul .
schroeder had said during a successful re-election campaign in september that germany would not join in any war on iraq , with or without a un mandate .
the staunch position was popular in germany but caused the frostiest relations with the united states since the second world war .
the chancellor later changed his stance , saying that while berlin stood by its refusal to join in with any conflict , us and nato forces would be allowed overflight rights and use of bases in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany will participate in nato operations against iraq chancellor schröder counters critics from within the governing parties and says that german soldiers will fly nato reconnaissance planes if the u.s. goes to war with iraq .
german government on collision course with the us again ?

but if they 're looking for rays of sunshine in a year that saw the literal black clouds of torrential rain and the figurative ones of economic recession loom over them , they can bask in the knowledge that their sportsmen and women stockpiled honors around the world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schummi celebrates his fifth world title .
it was once again michael schumacher 's year .
the german formula one ace left everyone else choking on his exhaust fumes as he romped home to claim his fifth world championship title .
the german anthem rang out and the flag was raised so often during his latest record breaking season , he might as well have been racing at home every time .
schummi took the checkered flag on an astounding 11 occasions throughout the season , wrapping the championship up with races to spare .
if the car continues to perform well next time out , who would bet against michael enjoying numerous champagne showers on the way to his sixth title ?
maybe his ever improving brother ralph will have something to say about that ... and let 's not forget , he 's german too of course .
golden haul crowns winter olympic successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic gold medallist claudia pechstein from a one man winning machine to a team effort worthy of praise .
germany went to salt lake city in the united states for the winter olympics and came home as the medal league 's top outfit .
the skaters , the skiers , the toboganists - in every event , german athletes combined in an astonishing performance that pipped the home country to the top spot by one medal .
there were many heroes , including claudia pechstein , the east german speed skating star who took home 2 gold medals in the 5000 meter and 3000 meter disciplines , in which she broke her own world record .
further olympic success came in the form of the german paralympic team who collected a total of 17 gold medals in their winter games and finished ahead of the pack in the race for medals .
dogged approach takes soccer team to world cup final from the snow and ice of salt lake city to the oppressive heat and monsoon storms of japan and korea .
state-of-the-art soccer stadiums , fanatical supporters and the world 's best teams combined to make the first asian world cup finals a colorful success .
to everyone 's surprise , including their own , the german national eleven overcame a crisis of belief to reach the final .
at times it was not pretty to watch , at others a delight but through sheer determination , typical german efficiency and more than a hint of luck , rudi völler 's boys battered their way to yokohama to face the brazilians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national soccer team celebrate on their return .
unfortunately , their luck ran out in the form of a rejuvenated ronaldo , scoring twice past a despairing oliver kahn to clinch the title for the south americans .
the german team , however , still came home to a hero 's reception .
german domestic football could also hold its head high despite falling at the last hurdle .
both bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund took the bundesliga to the pinnacle of the european stage by reaching the finals of the european champions league and uefa cup respectively .
leverkusen , after stomping on a number of prestigious reputations on the way , lost to real madrid while dortmund 's dominant run unraveled against psv eindhoven .
franzi leads by example as swimmers clean up at home as well as claiming victories across the globe , germany commanded in their own backyard .
at the european swimming championships in berlin , the germans won a total of 36 medals , 15 of them gold .
no other country came close to germany ’ s medal tally as the team advanced to the status of europe 's number 1 nation in swimming and diving .

on wednesday , chancellor gerhard schroeder said he would allow german air personnel to crew awacs surveillance aircraft in the event of war on iraq as long as they were seen to be involved in a nato support role only .

the staunch position was popular in germany but caused the frostiest relations with the united states since the second world war .

germany went to salt lake city in the united states for the winter olympics and came home as the medal league 's top outfit .
the skaters , the skiers , the toboganists - in every event , german athletes combined in an astonishing performance that pipped the home country to the top spot by one medal .
there were many heroes , including claudia pechstein , the east german speed skating star who took home 2 gold medals in the 5000 meter and 3000 meter disciplines , in which she broke her own world record .
further olympic success came in the form of the german paralympic team who collected a total of 17 gold medals in their winter games and finished ahead of the pack in the race for medals .

german domestic football could also hold its head high despite falling at the last hurdle .
both bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund took the bundesliga to the pinnacle of the european stage by reaching the finals of the european champions league and uefa cup respectively .

golden haul crowns winter olympic successes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olympic gold medallist claudia pechstein from a one man winning machine to a team effort worthy of praise .
germany went to salt lake city in the united states for the winter olympics and came home as the medal league 's top outfit .
the skaters , the skiers , the toboganists - in every event , german athletes combined in an astonishing performance that pipped the home country to the top spot by one medal .
there were many heroes , including claudia pechstein , the east german speed skating star who took home 2 gold medals in the 5000 meter and 3000 meter disciplines , in which she broke her own world record .
further olympic success came in the form of the german paralympic team who collected a total of 17 gold medals in their winter games and finished ahead of the pack in the race for medals .
dogged approach takes soccer team to world cup final from the snow and ice of salt lake city to the oppressive heat and monsoon storms of japan and korea .
state-of-the-art soccer stadiums , fanatical supporters and the world 's best teams combined to make the first asian world cup finals a colorful success .
to everyone 's surprise , including their own , the german national eleven overcame a crisis of belief to reach the final .
at times it was not pretty to watch , at others a delight but through sheer determination , typical german efficiency and more than a hint of luck , rudi völler 's boys battered their way to yokohama to face the brazilians .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german national soccer team celebrate on their return .
unfortunately , their luck ran out in the form of a rejuvenated ronaldo , scoring twice past a despairing oliver kahn to clinch the title for the south americans .
the german team , however , still came home to a hero 's reception .
german domestic football could also hold its head high despite falling at the last hurdle .
both bayer leverkusen and borussia dortmund took the bundesliga to the pinnacle of the european stage by reaching the finals of the european champions league and uefa cup respectively .
leverkusen , after stomping on a number of prestigious reputations on the way , lost to real madrid while dortmund 's dominant run unraveled against psv eindhoven .
franzi leads by example as swimmers clean up at home as well as claiming victories across the globe , germany commanded in their own backyard .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franziska van almsick tests the gold .
the championships heralded the return to form of german swimming sensation franziska van almsick who collected a personal horde of 5 gold medals while setting two new world records .
after poor form , injuries and personal problems , ' franzi ' was back as the darling of the german public .
elsewhere , the german basketball team astounded everyone by coming third in the world championships and the handball team went one further by finishing as runners-up in their competition .
more to come ?
so whatever the next year may bring in terms of the economy , unemployment and political upheaval , the germans can look forward to another year of sporting achievements .
it could be the 771 million euro -lrb- $ 790m -rrb- investment in sport by the government ; it may be the fruit of the east / west reunion or it may be just the germans habit of not giving up - whatever inspired the sports stars of germany to such success in 2002 , it is unlikely to dwindle away again in the coming year .

rachael lloyd , from wrexham , north wales , flew back from turkey with her father bob and sister beckie , 16 , who had gone out to fetch her .
their flight from istanbul touched down in manchester at 1109 gmt on sunday , but rachael made no comment to waiting reporters .
barman mehmet ocak , 24 , has reportedly been released without charge after originally being detained on suspicion of statutory rape .
when reporters on saturday asked rachael if she was glad to be returning home , she tearfully shook her head and answered : " no " .
" i want to be with steve -lsb- her nickname for mr ocak -rsb- because i love him , " she said .
rachael sparked a manhunt when she ran away from home two weeks ago to visit mr ocak .
she later phoned her family to say she had married mr ocak and had no intention of returning home .
turkish police traced the couple to mr ocak 's flat in the south-eastern city of gaziantep .
he was detained while she was taken into the care of turkish social services .
' certainly not married ' a british consulate official , who is travelling with rachael and her family , said rachael was " perfectly all right " .
he said she was " certainly not married " as it was legally impossible - but he was unsure whether there had been a ceremony of some kind .
" to marry in turkey you have to be 18 years old or 16 or 17 with parents ' permission , so it is impossible , " he said .
mr ocak was reportedly released on saturday without charges .
" her father decided not to press charges and ocak has now been released , " a spokesman for gaziantep police told reuters news agency .
mr ocak was reported as saying he had no idea rachael was only 14 .
" i thought rachael was 24 , " turkey 's semi-official anatolia news agency quoted him as saying .
" her family knew we were together here . "
' besotted ' in wrexham , social services and the education department have said they will meet to discuss the future care needs of rachael . "
i want to be with steve because i love him " rachael lloyd rachael 's mother karen thomas has previously said her daughter was " besotted " with mr ocak - and that the family needed " help " from social services .
rachael , who usually lives with her grandmother carol , met mr ocak in the mediterranean resort of marmaris , while on holiday in may .
she then returned to turkey at a later date and became engaged to mr ocak in the presence of her grandmother and her older sister , according to the turkish authorities .
at the airport returning home , rachael refused to board the plane and took a taxi back to marmaris .
a day later the british consulate sent her home .
she returned to turkey by herself on 1 december .
her parents had previously confiscated her passport , but it is thought she may have forged her father 's signature to obtain a new one .

the pace of technology is such that what was deemed cutting edge 15 years ago is generally considered obsolete today .
for households this has been evident in the steady migration from analogue to digital : vinyl gave way to cds , audio cassettes to minidisks and video tapes to dvds .
the television industry is facing similar problems with an ongoing project to transfer its archive footage from obsolete videotape to current tape formats or even digitised .
when planning project gutenberg , the internet archive of free electronic books , its architect , michael hart , recognised the problem .

domesday book of 1086 is in fine condition the original domesday book was written 925 years ago and is , for those who can read latin , still perfectly legible .
its intended digital successor , somewhat newer at 16 years old was , until this week , largely indecipherable .
this was not because the data had deteriorated , but the format chosen to record it had long been abandoned and so consequently devices to read it had disappeared as well .
last month , this issue of digital versus traditional archiving came to the fore in the uk parliament .
as part of its continuing plans to modernise westminster , the government put forward a proposal to end the centuries-old tradition of recording acts of parliament on vellum , commonly known as parchment .
appropriate parchment the plan was to replace them with cds and archival paper .
there were even rumours that the queen 's speech , also recorded on vellum , was being considered for transfer to a computer screen or autocue .
yet despite being previously approved by the house of lords , mps rejected the proposal .
labour 's brian white mp led the opposition .
cynics could argue that with the only uk firm still producing vellum in his constituency , he had a vested interest in defeating this proposal .
however , as a former computer systems analyst he acknowledged that there was a place for modern technology to record acts of parliament , but not as a replacement for traditional vellum .
perhaps it is with good reason that the paperless office promised by the digital revolution has yet to materialise .
digital archiving seems set to remain a supplement rather than a substitute for paper-held records for a while yet .

"
if the iaea fails to expeditiously take measures to meet our request , we will take the necessary measures unilaterally " north korean department of atomic energy on saturday , for the second time in three days , pyongyang wrote to the un watchdog - the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- - demanding that it remove the seals as soon as possible .
if the iaea failed to meet its request , north korea warned , the " necessary measures " would be taken unilaterally .
the communist state said on thursday it intended to reactivate its nuclear programme , following a decision by the united states to suspend oil shipments to the country .
under an agreement signed in 1994 , washington agreed to deliver oil to north korea in exchange for pyongyang 's pledge to freeze its nuclear programme .
but the united states says north korea has since admitted having a secret nuclear weapons programme .
un appeal after the first letter on thursday , the iaea urged north korea not " to take any steps unilaterally to remove or impede the functioning of such seals or cameras " .
nuclear power ?
may already have nuclear weapons could be months away from mass plutonium production has missiles with 2,000-km range see also : " it is essential that the containment and surveillance measures which are currently in place continue to be maintained , " iaea head mohammed elbaradei said .
an agency spokeswoman said mr elbaradei would be sending the north koreans another letter , spelling out his appeal more clearly .
earlier this week , un secretary-general kofi annan also appealed to pyongyang to respect the safeguards on its nuclear programme .
he said he hoped iaea inspectors not be kicked out of the country .
south korean red cross officials have said they will discuss the issue with officials from the north on monday , during talks originally meant to focus on family reunions and cross-border travel .
both seoul and tokyo have expressed concern over the pyongyang 's announcement that it will reactivate the plant at yongbyon , mothballed under the 1994 agreement .
pyongyang says it needs nuclear power from the plant to make up for the electricity shortfall caused by the ending of us heavy oil shipments .
yongbyon : site includes a 5-mwe experimental nuclear power reactor and a partially completed plutonium extraction facility .
the us believes the reactor and extraction plant have been used to produce plutonium - possibly enough for 1 or 2 nuclear weapons .
