doctor olwen williams is a genito-urinary physician and specialises in the promotion of sexual health .
common misconceptions about stds you have to have sex to catch an std stds can be picked up from toilet seats or sharing towels all stds have symptoms condoms are 100 % effective against infections you can tell by looking at someone if they have hiv dr williams said she has witnessed a significant increase in the number of cases of chlamydia during her work at the wrexham maelor and glan clwyd hospital .
chlamydia is a bacterial std and is sometimes called the " silent epidemic " because it can be relatively symptomless , but can damage a woman 's fertility if left untreated .
dr williams said : " we have pretty bad chlamydia figures , i 'm certainly seeing a 25 % rise in chlamydia over the last year with something like a 200 % rise over the past few years . "
some students at yale college in wrexham were unclear exactly what the disease was .
david webster and steven davies , both 16 , had confused opinions on the symptoms of the infection .
" i know it 's a sexually transmitted disease and it can cause impotency and infertility in women , " said mr webster .
mr davies added : " i just know its a sexually transmitted disease and it causes a rash . "
recent statistics have also suggested that both girls and boys are starting to have sex at a much earlier age than in previous decades .
dr williams confirmed the findings : " we do know the age of first sexual intercourse has been dropping dramatically .
sexually active " i see girls 13,14,15 on a regular basis coming through my clinics who have been sexually active for two or three years by the time they get to us . "
compared to the rest of the uk , wales has a higher rate of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections have also risen by 57 % in the past 10 years .
according to dr williams , around 685 people have been diagnosed with hiv in wales compared with nearly 48,000 in the uk as a whole .
the consultant believes there are issues which now need to be urgently addressed .
she said : " doing a lot more education around sexual health in schools is very important .
" if you educate young people to educate their peer group then you can actually see results . "
making condoms widely available and improving education are two of the schemes which have been highlighted in the north wales health authority 's sexual health strategy .
experts had discussed installing condom machines inside school toilets but the local health authority have said it is not a priority .
however , it is hoped the contraceptive will be made available at further education colleges .
dr williams believes condoms should be made more available : " i think it 's very embarrassing for a young lad to go into his local chemist where his mum goes , to actually ask for condoms . "
but the doctor admitted that contraceptives can be a difficult subject .
" what people are worried about is that if you increase access to things like condoms that people are going to have more sex but there 's no proof in that at all , " dr williams said .
money has also been made available for community education centres , to promote sexual health awareness .
sarah andrews , the training manager for the family planning association in wales said youngsters should be encouraged to visit sex education centres and clinics .
" young people should be praised and welcomed rather than shouted at , " she argued .
" campaigns are n't necessarily the best way of addressing the issue , improving education and improving services is the way forward . "
dr williams believes there are many misconceptions surrounding stds .
" a lot of people think that nice people do n't catch infections .
she added : " anyone who has unprotected sex at any age runs the risk of catching a sexually transmitted infection and it is a sad thing to admit , but we are all at risk . "

and with banks bowed beneath mountains of bad debt and increasingly reluctant to keep propping up their failing clients , the numbers are likely to increase .
the figures , released by leading private sector economic research firm teikoku databank , show that 19,441 companies went under in 2001 .
while this is a 1.9 % increase on 19,071 bankruptcies in 2000 , the record in recent years remains 1984 , when 20,841 firms went bust .
but the overall level of debt held by companies which collapsed into bankruptcy actually declined , down 32.4 % from its 2000 peak to 16,210bn yen -lrb- $ 122bn ; £ 85bn -rrb- .
string of scalps the first few months of this year are likely to see several more scalps added to the list .
march marks the end of the japanese financial year , and teikoku warned it could bring the end for more firms as their inability to clean up their books becomes clear .
the past 12 months has seen some high-profile cases , including retailers mycal and kotobukiya , contractors aoki and fujiko , and most recently customised housebuilder shokusan jutaku sogo .
and in the first bank to go under in years , mid-ranked ishikawa bank slid into bankruptcy .
one small ray of light came in the monthly figures , which revealed that the rate fell slightly in december .
compared with the 1,550 companies which went under in december 2000 , the final month of last year saw 1,505 bankruptcies .
but the absolute number concealed the fact that those which did go bust in december were much bigger than before .
the value of their debt soared 88 % to 1,560bn yen , the worst figure for december since 1997 and the second worst since world war two .

the australian economy seems to be riding out the global storm the buoyancy of australia 's economy is already looking out of step with the gloom and doom of both the rest of asia and the world at large .
and on top of surging consumer and business confidence , new research from one of the country 's main forecasting houses suggests australia 's growth could easily outstrip that of its main competitors in the year ahead .
according to access economics , gross domestic product could hit 3.7 % for 2002 , up from 2.3 % last year , as a booming housing sector , helped by interest rates at 30-year lows , and a conveniently weak australian dollar underpin a revival .
" australia may yet resurrect the title of miracle economy , " the forecaster said .
" it will easily outpace the world , riding a housing rocket , record low interest rates , federal spending largesse and a need to rebuild inventories . "
rocky road that is not to say the way ahead is entirely clear of obstacles , the group said .
" there is a risk a robust us recovery is delayed until early 2003 , " access director chris richardson said in a statement .
despite rock-bottom interest rates of 4.25 % , home loans are slightly below the storming pace they have set generally in 2001 , falling 0.3 % month on month after a rise of 17 % or more in the year till then .
and late in 2002 , exports could come under pressure , while unemployment is on the up , with 8,500 jobs lost in december and the jobless rate set to rise to 7.25 % by midyear from 6.7 % now .
but inflation looks likely to remain subdued so long as the australian dollar 's weakness persists after a year in which it fell nearly 9 % against the us dollar , the research body said .
at 2.3 % , access 's inflation forecast is little more than half the 4.3 % forecast for 2001 .

the highly critical document will be presented as evidence to one of the three inquiries into the epidemic .
in a separate report to be published next week , nfu cymru is submitting its view on the welsh assembly 's role during the crisis .
the nfu report is expected to criticise the ease with which illegal meat was able to be imported into britain and the speed with which the disease was able to spread .
the union is also expected to call for fines for airlines passengers caught smuggling meat from overseas .
hugh richards , president of the national farmers ' union in wales said : " we started looking at the fact that the disease or the cause of the disease - imported illegal meats - is still happening in this country and nothing has happened there .
" there were no contingency arrangements in place and the fact that -lrb- animal -rrb- movements were allowed to continue even days after the outbreak took place . "
the nfu is perhaps the union which worked most closely with government officials during the course of the foot-and-mouth outbreak .
its report will be submitted to the independent inquiry into the crisis , led by professor iain anderson .
in total , the crisis in wales is estimated to have cost nearly £ 500m .
