program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : world cup archive one world around football senegal upsets france in inaugural match cup kick off turns friends to foes german goal rush stuns saudis europe -pipe- 30.05.2002 breaking german football 's color barrier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerald asamoah , born in ghana , will be the first black player on the german world cup team a year after his debut performance for the german national team , gerald asamoah is on the brink of yet another entry in the annals of football folklore . although the german national team and supporters alike are resigned to the fact that a fourth world cup title is beyond them this time around , history is still likely to be made in japan and korea this year .
ghana-born gerald asamoah will become the first black player to take part in a major international tournament as part of a unified german team if he takes to the field in the far east over the coming weeks .
the 22-year-old schalke 04 attacking midfielder has already become the most dramatic character in coach rudi völler 's current revolution with his increasingly accepted presence in the national squad .
asamoah is not the first black player to represent a german side , however .
two black players , the sons of us soldiers , turned out for west germany in the 1970s , though their appearance was less well received .
debut goal endeared ghanian to german hearts germany has traditionally had one of the worst reputations in europe for far-right influence amongst its fans but after asamoah 's debut appearance and consequent first goal for the national side in the 2-0 friendly international win over slovakia last may , german newspapers were gushing with praise .
" asamoah wakes up a tired germany , " proclaimed the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
in acknowledgment of his extraordinary contribution in that historic game , the 20,000-strong crowd in bremen 's weserstadion gave asamoah a standing ovation when he took a lap of honour before leaving the field following a second-half substitution .
the player himself was emotional after the game .
" i thank god that my dream has come true , " he told reporters .
" it shows that i made the right decision to opt for germany .
it 's an honour to play for this country . "
each game a matter of life and death that night and the subsequent appearances for the german team that have culminated in his inclusion in the current world cup squad cap an amazing rise to prominence for a player who was once told by doctors to stop playing football for fear of suffering a heart attack .
he collapsed after a second division game in november 1998 while playing for hannover 96 and was diagnosed with a dangerous heart condition , similar to that of arsenal 's nigerian striker nwanko kanu .
asamoah now plays at his own risk and team doctors have emergency equipment on the sidelines just in case .
the 22-year-old who moved to germany 12 years ago took german citizenship last year , after turning down repeated offers to play for ghana .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's striker gerald asamoah , right , scores the 1-0 during the german first soccer league match tsv 1860 munich versus fc schalke 04 at the munich , germany , olympic stadium on sunday , march 17 , 2002 .
left is munich goalkeeper simon jentzsch .
-lrb- ap photo / uwe lein -rrb- he started his bundesliga career at lowly werder hannover before being snapped up by their mildly more successful neighbours in 1994 .
asamoah hit the big time when first division schalke 04 signed him in 1999 -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the powerful midfielder , who plays in an attacking role for schalke , has helped his club to domestic success and is the proud owner of a brace of german cup winners medals , the most recent secured in this season 's final against bayer leverkusen .
he also has a bundesliga runners-up medal after coming second with schalke in the heartbreaking conclusion to the 2000-2001 season when a 92nd minute free kick by bayern munich 's patrick anderson gave the bavarians the title .
midfielder with a message while hoping to increase his international goal tally at the world cup in june , asamoah has already come a long way from his roots in mampong .
although the mission in hand must be the quest for world cup glory with the german team , asamoah will use the tournament to continue to impress and inspire as a person and a sportsman .
he insists he does not want to appear as a " black saviour " but he is keen to change attitudes in his adopted country " just so that a few idiots realise that a black person can do something good for germany .

ghana-born gerald asamoah will become the first black player to take part in a major international tournament as part of a unified german team if he takes to the field in the far east over the coming weeks .
the 22-year-old schalke 04 attacking midfielder has already become the most dramatic character in coach rudi völler 's current revolution with his increasingly accepted presence in the national squad .
asamoah is not the first black player to represent a german side , however .
two black players , the sons of us soldiers , turned out for west germany in the 1970s , though their appearance was less well received .
debut goal endeared ghanian to german hearts germany has traditionally had one of the worst reputations in europe for far-right influence amongst its fans but after asamoah 's debut appearance and consequent first goal for the national side in the 2-0 friendly international win over slovakia last may , german newspapers were gushing with praise .
" asamoah wakes up a tired germany , " proclaimed the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
in acknowledgment of his extraordinary contribution in that historic game , the 20,000-strong crowd in bremen 's weserstadion gave asamoah a standing ovation when he took a lap of honour before leaving the field following a second-half substitution .
the player himself was emotional after the game .
" i thank god that my dream has come true , " he told reporters .
" it shows that i made the right decision to opt for germany .
it 's an honour to play for this country . "
each game a matter of life and death that night and the subsequent appearances for the german team that have culminated in his inclusion in the current world cup squad cap an amazing rise to prominence for a player who was once told by doctors to stop playing football for fear of suffering a heart attack .
he collapsed after a second division game in november 1998 while playing for hannover 96 and was diagnosed with a dangerous heart condition , similar to that of arsenal 's nigerian striker nwanko kanu .
asamoah now plays at his own risk and team doctors have emergency equipment on the sidelines just in case .
the 22-year-old who moved to germany 12 years ago took german citizenship last year , after turning down repeated offers to play for ghana .

the powerful midfielder , who plays in an attacking role for schalke , has helped his club to domestic success and is the proud owner of a brace of german cup winners medals , the most recent secured in this season 's final against bayer leverkusen .
he also has a bundesliga runners-up medal after coming second with schalke in the heartbreaking conclusion to the 2000-2001 season when a 92nd minute free kick by bayern munich 's patrick anderson gave the bavarians the title .
midfielder with a message while hoping to increase his international goal tally at the world cup in june , asamoah has already come a long way from his roots in mampong .
although the mission in hand must be the quest for world cup glory with the german team , asamoah will use the tournament to continue to impress and inspire as a person and a sportsman .
he insists he does not want to appear as a " black saviour " but he is keen to change attitudes in his adopted country " just so that a few idiots realise that a black person can do something good for germany .

ghana-born gerald asamoah will become the first black player to take part in a major international tournament as part of a unified german team if he takes to the field in the far east over the coming weeks .
the 22-year-old schalke 04 attacking midfielder has already become the most dramatic character in coach rudi völler 's current revolution with his increasingly accepted presence in the national squad .
asamoah is not the first black player to represent a german side , however .
two black players , the sons of us soldiers , turned out for west germany in the 1970s , though their appearance was less well received .
debut goal endeared ghanian to german hearts germany has traditionally had one of the worst reputations in europe for far-right influence amongst its fans but after asamoah 's debut appearance and consequent first goal for the national side in the 2-0 friendly international win over slovakia last may , german newspapers were gushing with praise .
" asamoah wakes up a tired germany , " proclaimed the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
in acknowledgment of his extraordinary contribution in that historic game , the 20,000-strong crowd in bremen 's weserstadion gave asamoah a standing ovation when he took a lap of honour before leaving the field following a second-half substitution .
the player himself was emotional after the game .
" i thank god that my dream has come true , " he told reporters .
" it shows that i made the right decision to opt for germany .
it 's an honour to play for this country . "
each game a matter of life and death that night and the subsequent appearances for the german team that have culminated in his inclusion in the current world cup squad cap an amazing rise to prominence for a player who was once told by doctors to stop playing football for fear of suffering a heart attack .
he collapsed after a second division game in november 1998 while playing for hannover 96 and was diagnosed with a dangerous heart condition , similar to that of arsenal 's nigerian striker nwanko kanu .
asamoah now plays at his own risk and team doctors have emergency equipment on the sidelines just in case .
the 22-year-old who moved to germany 12 years ago took german citizenship last year , after turning down repeated offers to play for ghana .

the powerful midfielder , who plays in an attacking role for schalke , has helped his club to domestic success and is the proud owner of a brace of german cup winners medals , the most recent secured in this season 's final against bayer leverkusen .
he also has a bundesliga runners-up medal after coming second with schalke in the heartbreaking conclusion to the 2000-2001 season when a 92nd minute free kick by bayern munich 's patrick anderson gave the bavarians the title .
midfielder with a message while hoping to increase his international goal tally at the world cup in june , asamoah has already come a long way from his roots in mampong .
although the mission in hand must be the quest for world cup glory with the german team , asamoah will use the tournament to continue to impress and inspire as a person and a sportsman .
he insists he does not want to appear as a " black saviour " but he is keen to change attitudes in his adopted country " just so that a few idiots realise that a black person can do something good for germany .

ghana-born gerald asamoah will become the first black player to take part in a major international tournament as part of a unified german team if he takes to the field in the far east over the coming weeks .
the 22-year-old schalke 04 attacking midfielder has already become the most dramatic character in coach rudi völler 's current revolution with his increasingly accepted presence in the national squad .
asamoah is not the first black player to represent a german side , however .

ghana-born gerald asamoah will become the first black player to take part in a major international tournament as part of a unified german team if he takes to the field in the far east over the coming weeks .
the 22-year-old schalke 04 attacking midfielder has already become the most dramatic character in coach rudi völler 's current revolution with his increasingly accepted presence in the national squad .
asamoah is not the first black player to represent a german side , however .
two black players , the sons of us soldiers , turned out for west germany in the 1970s , though their appearance was less well received .
debut goal endeared ghanian to german hearts germany has traditionally had one of the worst reputations in europe for far-right influence amongst its fans but after asamoah 's debut appearance and consequent first goal for the national side in the 2-0 friendly international win over slovakia last may , german newspapers were gushing with praise .
" asamoah wakes up a tired germany , " proclaimed the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
in acknowledgment of his extraordinary contribution in that historic game , the 20,000-strong crowd in bremen 's weserstadion gave asamoah a standing ovation when he took a lap of honour before leaving the field following a second-half substitution .
the player himself was emotional after the game .
" i thank god that my dream has come true , " he told reporters .
" it shows that i made the right decision to opt for germany .
it 's an honour to play for this country . "
each game a matter of life and death that night and the subsequent appearances for the german team that have culminated in his inclusion in the current world cup squad cap an amazing rise to prominence for a player who was once told by doctors to stop playing football for fear of suffering a heart attack .
he collapsed after a second division game in november 1998 while playing for hannover 96 and was diagnosed with a dangerous heart condition , similar to that of arsenal 's nigerian striker nwanko kanu .

ghana-born gerald asamoah will become the first black player to take part in a major international tournament as part of a unified german team if he takes to the field in the far east over the coming weeks .
the 22-year-old schalke 04 attacking midfielder has already become the most dramatic character in coach rudi völler 's current revolution with his increasingly accepted presence in the national squad .
asamoah is not the first black player to represent a german side , however .
two black players , the sons of us soldiers , turned out for west germany in the 1970s , though their appearance was less well received .
debut goal endeared ghanian to german hearts germany has traditionally had one of the worst reputations in europe for far-right influence amongst its fans but after asamoah 's debut appearance and consequent first goal for the national side in the 2-0 friendly international win over slovakia last may , german newspapers were gushing with praise .
" asamoah wakes up a tired germany , " proclaimed the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
in acknowledgment of his extraordinary contribution in that historic game , the 20,000-strong crowd in bremen 's weserstadion gave asamoah a standing ovation when he took a lap of honour before leaving the field following a second-half substitution .
the player himself was emotional after the game .
" i thank god that my dream has come true , " he told reporters .
" it shows that i made the right decision to opt for germany .
it 's an honour to play for this country . "
each game a matter of life and death that night and the subsequent appearances for the german team that have culminated in his inclusion in the current world cup squad cap an amazing rise to prominence for a player who was once told by doctors to stop playing football for fear of suffering a heart attack .
he collapsed after a second division game in november 1998 while playing for hannover 96 and was diagnosed with a dangerous heart condition , similar to that of arsenal 's nigerian striker nwanko kanu .
asamoah now plays at his own risk and team doctors have emergency equipment on the sidelines just in case .
the 22-year-old who moved to germany 12 years ago took german citizenship last year , after turning down repeated offers to play for ghana .

the powerful midfielder , who plays in an attacking role for schalke , has helped his club to domestic success and is the proud owner of a brace of german cup winners medals , the most recent secured in this season 's final against bayer leverkusen .
he also has a bundesliga runners-up medal after coming second with schalke in the heartbreaking conclusion to the 2000-2001 season when a 92nd minute free kick by bayern munich 's patrick anderson gave the bavarians the title .
midfielder with a message while hoping to increase his international goal tally at the world cup in june , asamoah has already come a long way from his roots in mampong .
although the mission in hand must be the quest for world cup glory with the german team , asamoah will use the tournament to continue to impress and inspire as a person and a sportsman .
he insists he does not want to appear as a " black saviour " but he is keen to change attitudes in his adopted country " just so that a few idiots realise that a black person can do something good for germany .

ghana-born gerald asamoah will become the first black player to take part in a major international tournament as part of a unified german team if he takes to the field in the far east over the coming weeks .
the 22-year-old schalke 04 attacking midfielder has already become the most dramatic character in coach rudi völler 's current revolution with his increasingly accepted presence in the national squad .
asamoah is not the first black player to represent a german side , however .
two black players , the sons of us soldiers , turned out for west germany in the 1970s , though their appearance was less well received .
debut goal endeared ghanian to german hearts germany has traditionally had one of the worst reputations in europe for far-right influence amongst its fans but after asamoah 's debut appearance and consequent first goal for the national side in the 2-0 friendly international win over slovakia last may , german newspapers were gushing with praise .
" asamoah wakes up a tired germany , " proclaimed the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
in acknowledgment of his extraordinary contribution in that historic game , the 20,000-strong crowd in bremen 's weserstadion gave asamoah a standing ovation when he took a lap of honour before leaving the field following a second-half substitution .
the player himself was emotional after the game .
" i thank god that my dream has come true , " he told reporters .
" it shows that i made the right decision to opt for germany .
it 's an honour to play for this country . "
each game a matter of life and death that night and the subsequent appearances for the german team that have culminated in his inclusion in the current world cup squad cap an amazing rise to prominence for a player who was once told by doctors to stop playing football for fear of suffering a heart attack .
he collapsed after a second division game in november 1998 while playing for hannover 96 and was diagnosed with a dangerous heart condition , similar to that of arsenal 's nigerian striker nwanko kanu .
asamoah now plays at his own risk and team doctors have emergency equipment on the sidelines just in case .
the 22-year-old who moved to germany 12 years ago took german citizenship last year , after turning down repeated offers to play for ghana .

the powerful midfielder , who plays in an attacking role for schalke , has helped his club to domestic success and is the proud owner of a brace of german cup winners medals , the most recent secured in this season 's final against bayer leverkusen .
he also has a bundesliga runners-up medal after coming second with schalke in the heartbreaking conclusion to the 2000-2001 season when a 92nd minute free kick by bayern munich 's patrick anderson gave the bavarians the title .
midfielder with a message while hoping to increase his international goal tally at the world cup in june , asamoah has already come a long way from his roots in mampong .

asamoah hit the big time when first division schalke 04 signed him in 1999 -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the powerful midfielder , who plays in an attacking role for schalke , has helped his club to domestic success and is the proud owner of a brace of german cup winners medals , the most recent secured in this season 's final against bayer leverkusen .
he also has a bundesliga runners-up medal after coming second with schalke in the heartbreaking conclusion to the 2000-2001 season when a 92nd minute free kick by bayern munich 's patrick anderson gave the bavarians the title .
midfielder with a message while hoping to increase his international goal tally at the world cup in june , asamoah has already come a long way from his roots in mampong .
although the mission in hand must be the quest for world cup glory with the german team , asamoah will use the tournament to continue to impress and inspire as a person and a sportsman .
he insists he does not want to appear as a " black saviour " but he is keen to change attitudes in his adopted country " just so that a few idiots realise that a black person can do something good for germany .

ghana-born gerald asamoah will become the first black player to take part in a major international tournament as part of a unified german team if he takes to the field in the far east over the coming weeks .
the 22-year-old schalke 04 attacking midfielder has already become the most dramatic character in coach rudi völler 's current revolution with his increasingly accepted presence in the national squad .
asamoah is not the first black player to represent a german side , however .
two black players , the sons of us soldiers , turned out for west germany in the 1970s , though their appearance was less well received .
debut goal endeared ghanian to german hearts germany has traditionally had one of the worst reputations in europe for far-right influence amongst its fans but after asamoah 's debut appearance and consequent first goal for the national side in the 2-0 friendly international win over slovakia last may , german newspapers were gushing with praise .
" asamoah wakes up a tired germany , " proclaimed the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
in acknowledgment of his extraordinary contribution in that historic game , the 20,000-strong crowd in bremen 's weserstadion gave asamoah a standing ovation when he took a lap of honour before leaving the field following a second-half substitution .
the player himself was emotional after the game .
" i thank god that my dream has come true , " he told reporters .
" it shows that i made the right decision to opt for germany .
it 's an honour to play for this country . "
each game a matter of life and death that night and the subsequent appearances for the german team that have culminated in his inclusion in the current world cup squad cap an amazing rise to prominence for a player who was once told by doctors to stop playing football for fear of suffering a heart attack .
he collapsed after a second division game in november 1998 while playing for hannover 96 and was diagnosed with a dangerous heart condition , similar to that of arsenal 's nigerian striker nwanko kanu .
asamoah now plays at his own risk and team doctors have emergency equipment on the sidelines just in case .
the 22-year-old who moved to germany 12 years ago took german citizenship last year , after turning down repeated offers to play for ghana .

left is munich goalkeeper simon jentzsch .
-lrb- ap photo / uwe lein -rrb- he started his bundesliga career at lowly werder hannover before being snapped up by their mildly more successful neighbours in 1994 .
asamoah hit the big time when first division schalke 04 signed him in 1999 -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the powerful midfielder , who plays in an attacking role for schalke , has helped his club to domestic success and is the proud owner of a brace of german cup winners medals , the most recent secured in this season 's final against bayer leverkusen .
he also has a bundesliga runners-up medal after coming second with schalke in the heartbreaking conclusion to the 2000-2001 season when a 92nd minute free kick by bayern munich 's patrick anderson gave the bavarians the title .
midfielder with a message while hoping to increase his international goal tally at the world cup in june , asamoah has already come a long way from his roots in mampong .
although the mission in hand must be the quest for world cup glory with the german team , asamoah will use the tournament to continue to impress and inspire as a person and a sportsman .
he insists he does not want to appear as a " black saviour " but he is keen to change attitudes in his adopted country " just so that a few idiots realise that a black person can do something good for germany .

ghana-born gerald asamoah will become the first black player to take part in a major international tournament as part of a unified german team if he takes to the field in the far east over the coming weeks .
the 22-year-old schalke 04 attacking midfielder has already become the most dramatic character in coach rudi völler 's current revolution with his increasingly accepted presence in the national squad .
asamoah is not the first black player to represent a german side , however .
two black players , the sons of us soldiers , turned out for west germany in the 1970s , though their appearance was less well received .
debut goal endeared ghanian to german hearts germany has traditionally had one of the worst reputations in europe for far-right influence amongst its fans but after asamoah 's debut appearance and consequent first goal for the national side in the 2-0 friendly international win over slovakia last may , german newspapers were gushing with praise .
" asamoah wakes up a tired germany , " proclaimed the mass-circulation bild newspaper .
in acknowledgment of his extraordinary contribution in that historic game , the 20,000-strong crowd in bremen 's weserstadion gave asamoah a standing ovation when he took a lap of honour before leaving the field following a second-half substitution .
the player himself was emotional after the game .
" i thank god that my dream has come true , " he told reporters .
" it shows that i made the right decision to opt for germany .
it 's an honour to play for this country . "
each game a matter of life and death that night and the subsequent appearances for the german team that have culminated in his inclusion in the current world cup squad cap an amazing rise to prominence for a player who was once told by doctors to stop playing football for fear of suffering a heart attack .
he collapsed after a second division game in november 1998 while playing for hannover 96 and was diagnosed with a dangerous heart condition , similar to that of arsenal 's nigerian striker nwanko kanu .
asamoah now plays at his own risk and team doctors have emergency equipment on the sidelines just in case .
the 22-year-old who moved to germany 12 years ago took german citizenship last year , after turning down repeated offers to play for ghana .

asamoah hit the big time when first division schalke 04 signed him in 1999 -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the powerful midfielder , who plays in an attacking role for schalke , has helped his club to domestic success and is the proud owner of a brace of german cup winners medals , the most recent secured in this season 's final against bayer leverkusen .
he also has a bundesliga runners-up medal after coming second with schalke in the heartbreaking conclusion to the 2000-2001 season when a 92nd minute free kick by bayern munich 's patrick anderson gave the bavarians the title .
midfielder with a message while hoping to increase his international goal tally at the world cup in june , asamoah has already come a long way from his roots in mampong .
although the mission in hand must be the quest for world cup glory with the german team , asamoah will use the tournament to continue to impress and inspire as a person and a sportsman .
he insists he does not want to appear as a " black saviour " but he is keen to change attitudes in his adopted country " just so that a few idiots realise that a black person can do something good for germany .

the boundaries announced by the scottish executive are smaller than expected .
ministers have decided to exclude two local authorities from the cairngorms national park altogether .

we have sought to strike a balance between the desire to include all those who want to be part of such an exciting venture and the need to create a park with a clear focus and identity " allan wilson deputy minister the park was expected to be more than twice the size of the lake district .
however , the plans put forward by the scottish executive showed boundaries stretching from grantown-on-spey in the north to the glenshee ski area in the south , and from ballater in the east and kingussie and newtonmore in the west .
that will still make it the largest in the uk , but does not include the areas which fall within the boundaries of perth and kinross and angus .
bill wright of the cairngorms campaign said the proposed boundary threatened to destroy one of the nation 's most priceless assets .
he also predicted it would wreck the cairngorms ' chances of being chosen as a world heritage site .
' national treasure ' however , the scottish executive said that it wanted to keep as tight a focus as possible .
the final proposals were announced by deputy environment and rural development minister allan wilson .
" the area we want to include in the park is already a national treasure , " he said .
" that means we will expect the park to benefit not only those communities within its boundaries , but also people all across scotland who enjoy the outdoors , such as walkers , anglers or naturalists .
" in putting forward proposals on the powers and extent of the park , we have sought to strike a balance between the desire to include all those who want to be part of such an exciting venture and the need to create a park with a clear focus and identity . "
the members of the park authority will be either directly elected or nominated by highland , aberdeenshire and moray councils , or appointed directly by ministers .
the body will have responsibility for conserving and enhancing the special qualities of the area .
it will also support the social and economic development of the area 's communities .
and the authority will work in partnership with the local councils on planning issues .
first park ministers had received a petition calling for the new park body to be given full planning powers .
the cairngorms campaign and the scottish council for national parks had called for the step , but highland council felt it should retain control .

search teams have located voice cockpit and flight data recorders which could provide clues as to why the boeing 747 broke up mid-air and plunged into the sea .
we have not decided when we will begin to salvage the black boxes aviation safety council official but officials said the search for bodies was the top priority .
about 90 of the 225 feared victims have been recovered so far .
the black boxes - actually orange in colour - are thought to be off taiwan 's penghu island .
" we are double checking their position and may send divers with undersea cameras later , " an official from taiwan 's aviation safety council said .
" but we have not decided when we will begin to salvage the black boxes because the weather is poor . "
search teams have also located a large chunk of wreckage from flight ci 611 , which crashed 20 minutes into its journey from taipei to hong kong .
it is suspected to be the front cabin , where some victims could be still be strapped into their seats .
" the first priority is to recover bodies , then the black boxes , then the wreckage , " transport minister lin lin-san told reporters on thursday .
specialist help taiwan has said it plans to ask the us and china for satellite and radar data which could help locate wreckage and give a better indication of how the debris fell .
the flight captain 's hat has been recovered the lack of answers has prompted angry relatives to complain about china airlines ' response to the disaster , and there have been calls from taiwanese politicians for the state-controlled airline to be privatised .
us air safety experts are helping in the investigation , because of their experience with two other crashes which appear to have similarities with this one , and which also needed deep-sea salvage skills .
china airlines accidents 1999 - md11 airliner crash lands in hong kong , killing three people 1998 - a300-600 airliner crashes near taipei killing all 197 on board and at least seven on ground 1994 - a300-600 crashes in nagoya , japan , killing 264 people 1989 - 737-200 hits mountain near hualien , taiwan , killing 56 people the two crashes were a mid-air explosion of a twa boeing jet in 1996 off the new york coast , and a swissair md11 which crashed into the sea off canada after leaving new york in 1998 .
investigators later attributed the twa crash to an explosion in the plane 's fuel tank .
aviation specialists have put forward several theories about the causes of the china airlines crash - an internal explosion , sudden cabin depressurisation , a mid-air collision , or a military accident .

the bird , the golden-crowned manakin , was first found in 1957 - also the year it was last seen .
ornithologists say its reappearance means there is more hope of finding other species lost for decades .
but they are worried that threats to the bird 's rainforest habitat may mean its hold on life will be short .
the manakin was discovered 45 years ago by the german-born ornithologist helmut sick , in para state in southern amazonia .
two years later it was officially recognised as a distinct species .
several unsuccessful attempts to find the bird have been made since 1957 .
then , within the last week , two brazilian scientists rediscovered it by chance .
the two , fabio olmos and jose fernando pacheco , were carrying out an environmental survey along the line of a new road being built for the logging industry .
they found the bird - a single male - several hundred kilometres from sick 's original discovery of five birds .
not safe yet fabio olmos said : " we were thrilled to find the lost manakin - quite distinctive from other manakins .
" the local economy is based on logging and cattle-ranching on cleared land .
the brazilian government is encouraging colonisation but has no way of controlling loggers , squatters , colonists and gold miners once access is created .
spix 's macaw : the world 's rarest bird ?
" forest destruction will remain a major threat to the long-term survival of this beautiful bird and other wildlife of the area . "
birdlife international , an alliance of conservation groups working in more than 100 countries , is setting up a network of conservationists in brazil , including the manakin 's finders .
alison stattersfield of birdlife said : " this is tremendous news , but there are genuine concerns that the manakin 's habitat is under threat from the continued destruction of the fantastic amazonian rainforest . "
gone for a century ade long of birdlife told bbc news online : " more new bird species have been reported from brazil in the last 10 years than from anywhere else on earth .
" so the manakin 's reappearance encourages us not only to keep looking out for vanished species , but to hope that there are entirely new ones for us still to find .
" and jose fernando pacheco has a very good record .
he 's rediscovered two other lost species in the last decade .
" one ' lost ' bird he was involved with , the kinglet cotinga , which looks like a goldcrest , had n't been seen since the 19th century .

the finding adds weight to the theory that a strict religious upbringing may make people more prone to the psychological problem .
common obsessions fear of contamination fear of causing harm to another fear of making a mistake fear of behaving in a socially unacceptable manner need for symmetry or exactness obsessive-compulsive disorder is an anxiety disorder in which people are persistantly compelled to carry out ritualised behaviour in response to recurring thoughts which are often completely irrational .
for instance , sufferers often become obessesed with the notion that they are contaminated with germs , leading to hour upon hour of washing .
the condition can become so bad that it prevents people from leading a normal life .
the causes of the disorder , which affects at least 5 million americans and a million britons , are still obscure .
but genes , upbringing , head injuries and emotional trauma have all been implicated .
new scientist magazine reports that researchers from the university of parma in italy have found that committed catholics are more likely to show symptoms of ocd .
not conclusive common compulsions hand washing ordering checking praying repeating words silently the scientists compared people , such as nuns and priests who worked in the church , with committed lay catholics and others with virtually no religious involvement .
each subject was asked to document mild ocd symptoms , such as intrusive mental images or worries .
the more devout catholics reported more severe symptoms .
the researchers stress that their study does not prove that religious devotion early in life causes ocd .
they say it is possible that people with a tendency to develop the condition may also be attracted by the religious lifestyle .
dr lynne drummond , a psychiatrist at st george 's hospital , said that it was likely that people must have a genetic predisposition to develop symptoms of ocd .
however , she said many ocd patients do say they had a strict upbringing where actions were either right or wrong , black or white .
personal responsbility ian hancock , an expert in ocd from dumfries and galloway primary care nhs trust , believes that although there is probably a genetic compotent to the condition , environmental factors , such as parenting , are likely to play an important role in its development .
he said people with ocd tended to have an exaggerated sense of their own responsibility for events , often when no blame could possibly be attached to them .
" as a religion catholicism does rather tend to emphasise personal responsibility , guilt and right and wrong .
" any strong teaching that emphasises these issues in a very powerful way could be additional pressure for somebody who is prone to feeling guilt in the first place .
" it could well be a factor contributing towards the development of an obsessional-compulsive coping strategy . "
mr hancock said it was important that devout catholics who found themselves struggling with ocd took on board the broad teachings of the church , and tried not to focus exclusively on the elements that emphasised personal responsibility .
a spokesman for the catholic bishops ' conference of england and wales said : " this survey needs to be taken with a pinch of salt .
" it would very interesting to know the size of the sample on which it was based .
" certainly , i have heard of no catholic clergy in england and wales who even have the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder . "
there is evidence to suggest that a religious belief can aid mental health .

welsh development agency contractors will begin construction on a 38,800sq ft manufacturing unit at newport .
it is the first phase of a £ 14.5m programme to create more than 600 jobs in south east wales , which was among the worst worst hit areas by corus ' announcement of 6,050 uk job losses .
rhodri morgan detailed a £ 76m package in january the agency is aiming to build 215,000sq ft of manufacturing space to attract new employers in caerphilly , blaenau gwent , ebbw vale , newport and torfaen .
using welsh assembly and european cash , it plans to regenerate the region after the bombshell from the anglo-dutch steel giant .
llanwern 's legacy it comes as wda executive graham moore is appointed chief executive of wales ' first urban regeneration company - another initiative unveiled by the first minister in january in a £ 76m package .
the newport urc will look to drive development opportunities in the city , which was hit by the winding down of corus ' nearby llanwern works with its 1,340 jobs .
a total of 1,300 jobs have been lost at llanwern working with newport city council and the wda , mr moore 's focus will be the development of key sites , for the private sector according to a statement issued jointly by the organisations .
the statement hinted those locations would feature " major projects " at the existing corus works as well as the city 's riverside and town centre districts .
it did not indicate any discussions had been held with specific companies , however .
thursday 's work is getting underway at the queensway meadows industrial park .
the urc will have £ 10m from the assembly 's fund and another £ 10m from the development agency to spend over the next three years .
training measures since the steelmaker 's announcement in february of 2001 , the development agency and the assembly have spearheaded a united regeneration effort under the team wales banner .
so far , that has involved quickly identifying re-training needs for a post-industrial economy .
corus job cuts locations llanwern - 1,340 shotton , deeside - 319 ebbw vale - 780 teesside - 234 bryngwyn - 127 strip products - 200 divisions head offices - 400 construction and industrial - 1,086 engineering steels - 390 tubes - 298 european market unit - 292 electrical steel - 276 special profiles - 46 special strip - 35 rail 27 corporate centre - 200 plans to woo employers with factory spaces , however , are a sign the team has acknowledged the importance of the tradition manufacturing sector .
the strategy follows january 's £ 76m regeneration package announcement from rhodri morgan .
it comprised £ 16m from the uk government and european union and £ 55m from cardiff bay , all announced in may 2001 .
a passenger rail link between ebbw vale and cardiff - closed 40 years ago - will re-open in 2004 in a £ 15m scheme using £ 7m from the welsh assembly .
aid was also promised for communities at shotton , flintshire , and bryngwyn near swansea .
team wales team wales will be hoping the latest initiative can pay off after criticism of its programmes ' progress so far .
in september , cardiff university 's regeneration institute criticised all involved agencies for not working closely enough .
its report - commissioned by the welsh assembly and welsh development agency - concluded policy should be centred on life-long learning opportunities .
newport urc chief mr moore has cut his teeth as the wda 's corus programme director for the last 12 months .
born in the city , he helped sir terry matthews win the ryder cup bid for the area .
" the urc will develop the policy and provide the strategic direction necessary to take the city forward , " he said .
" the first priority will be to formulate a business plan to bring together both the public and private sectors in partnership to agree an ambitious plan for newport 's regeneration . "
wales ' economic development minister andrew davies added said the programme would create " attractive premises for new businesses which will kick start the economic regeneration of the area .

the ball - built by tony evans from swansea - weighed in at 2,524 lbs , squashing the previous figure of 2,450lbs .
however , the record still has to be officially certified by the guinness world records .
" i know the record is there for the taking and it 's right that the world 's biggest rubber band ball should be rolled out where the biggest ball games in wales are played , " mr evans said .
six million bands the full-time foster carer constructed the welsh millennium ball using rubber bands donated from across the uk .
he estimates over six million bands have been used to make the ball , which has a circumference of 14ft 8ins and stands 4ft 5in tall .
the 53-year-old said the ball , which he keeps beside his house , has attracted a lot of attention .
" people are always stopping by the gate when i 'm working on the ball and talking to me about it , " he said .
" i ca n't believe the size of it sometimes .
it has grown beyond belief . "
family hobby mr evans and his wife elizabeth have been fostering children for around eight years .
" every child that comes here wants to build a rubber band ball , " he said .
" there are now several smaller balls around the house . "
mr evans admitted that the hobby has taken up a lot of his spare time .
" i used to be making the ball seven to eight hours a day .
" when the hobby started , i made it in the house , " he said .
rubber band ball enthusiasts have taken to the web " but my wife was so fed up of there being rubber bands all over the place , she banished me to the shed . "
the ball was transported from swansea to the stadium on thursday and rolled on to the pitch where mr evans put the finishing bands in place .
it was weighed and by an expert from plane weighs from swansea .
photographic and video evidence will now be sent to for ratification to guinness world records so they can confirm the record .
and mr evans is not alone .
there is a small and growing community of rubber band ball builders on the web , from as far afield as hawaii and ohio , all sharing tips .
most enthusiasts are keen to take rubber band donations from contributors .
but mr evans ' ball dwarves one of its nearest rivals - a 10,000-band , 2ft 6ins us version nicknamed " the biggest waste of office supplies in new jersey " .

halliburton is the latest in a string of companies to come under fire for allegedly shielding their true financial position from investors and analysts .
mr cheney was chairman and chief executive of the company between 1995 and 2000 and the probe revolves around the firm 's accounts in 1998 .
the enron scandal prompted the push to clean up corporate america when it emerged that the disgraced energy firm had been reporting highly misleading accounts .
costs under scrutiny the us financial watchdog has begun a preliminary investigation into halliburton for its treatment of over-running costs on its construction projects .
halliburton said it would cooperate fully with the inquiry , and documents are expected to be formally requested in the next few days .
the firm says it believes the way it had accounted for construction claims was in accordance with generally accepted practices .
the firm 's chief financial officer , doug foshee , said he was not surprised by the probe given the current investigative environment , but thought the matter could be cleared up quickly .
worried investors worries over the probe sent shares in the group 7.5 % lower in early trading in new york on wednesday , before recovering slightly to close down 3 % .
the share price of a number of other companies including dynegy , worldcom and kmart have suffered a similar fate recently due to the threat of investigations .
halliburton has also been embroiled in a controversy over asbestos exposure .
on tuesday , it settled 30 pending lawsuits for millions of dollars in damage from people suffering with lung cancer .

the firm says it believes the way it had accounted for construction claims was in accordance with generally accepted practices .
the firm 's chief financial officer , doug foshee , said he was not surprised by the probe given the current investigative environment , but thought the matter could be cleared up quickly .
worried investors worries over the probe sent shares in the group 7.5 % lower in early trading in new york on wednesday , before recovering slightly to close down 3 % .
the share price of a number of other companies including dynegy , worldcom and kmart have suffered a similar fate recently due to the threat of investigations .

they had to do something to acknowledge the fact that cantor fitzgerald is inextricably tied to the attacks margaret duffy professor of advertising the bond trader , which occupied five floors of the north tower of the world trade center , lost 658 employees in the attacks .
the $ 4m advertising campaign features employees who survived the attacks remembering co-workers and talking about the need to rebuild cantor 's business .
the ads , which are shown both on television and in print , have caused some to question whether its appropriate for the firm to create an advertising campaign based on the tragedy .
getting the message out " it 's certainly the first time that a company has used 11 september outright as an advertising theme , " says mercedes cardona , financial editor at advertising age magazine .
steve merkel : " we have to keep going " while some firms mentioned the attacks in adverts immediately following 9/11 to reassure customers , she says , none has taken the step cantor has in having employees reminisce about those who died .
" we have n't heard these type of testimonial ads used except for charities , " ms cardona says .
for some it raises the question of taste , a topic that is always at the forefront of any ad campaign .
but most say cantor has simply found a way to acknowledge that it was deeply affected by the attacks , while getting the message out that it is moving forward with its business .
surviving family members have largely been supportive of the adverts as has a victims-support group .
pledging profits in order to be effective , not only in selling a product or service but in avoiding offending people , firms and their advertising agencies are always in search of perfect pitch , says margaret duffy , professor of advertising at the university of missouri .
" what they are doing is using this as some sort of strategic way of getting back in the selling business and out of the grieving business .
" they had to do something to acknowledge the fact that cantor fitzgerald is inextricably tied to the attacks . "
while cantor has struck a delicate balance in assuring the adds do n't offend , professor duffy says cantor may have failed to convey what it is they are selling .
they ads , which feature nine surviving cantor employees , do not mention the firm 's espeed electronic bond-trading software .
rather , they dwell on the need for cantor and its employees to get on with building the business , while remembering those who were killed .
" if you were to view these , you would have no clue what espeed is or why i should buy it , " professor duffy says .
driving force cantor undeniably has had a tough time following the attacks .
rumours swarmed immediately after 11 september that the firm would cease to exist , having lost three-quarters of its new york staff and nearly all of its staff who specialised in trading stocks .
employees of the firm have been scattered among several locations throughout the new york metropolitan area , and the firm remains committed to helping the families of deceased employees .
cantor has pledged that 25 % of its profits over the next five years will go to support the families of its former employees who were killed in the attacks .
that commitment is the driving force behind the efforts of all the current employees at cantor , says amy nauiokas , senior vice president of global marketing .
" it 's everything that we are as a firm , " she says .
" the whole concept of taking care of the families is what drives us .
it 's why we get up in the morning . "

south korea : plenty to cheer about " the french economy grew by 3.3 % in 1998 , and a significant element of that was attributed to france 's world cup victory , " says dr bill gerrard , a football finance expert at leeds university business school .
" sporting occasions like these are huge commercial events , and they bring tremendous benefits to the host countries . "
last week , official figures showed that japan 's long-stagnant economy grew by 0.6 % during the first three months of the year .
in korea , figures out earlier this month showed a bullish 5.7 % expansion over the same period , drawing a line under the recession that gripped the country in the wake of the 1997-98 emerging markets crisis .

questions are also being asked about the long-term future of the twenty new football stadiums that the two world cup hosts have built between them .
according to mr gratton , the decision to hold the tournament in two countries has resulted in a wasteful duplication of facilities .
" it seems to be very inefficient .
neither country has a well-developed football league , so what 's going to happen to these stadiums in the next ten years ? " he said .

the pension credit will be introduced in october 2003 and has been heralded by the government as a way of rewarding pensioners on low and modest incomes for saving . "
people will have heard about a pensions credit which rewards savings , and will be disappointed to find out they wo n't qualify for another five years " sally west , age concern it has two elements : a pension credit that will guarantee a single pensioner a minimum income of £ 100 a week and a savings element , worth up to £ 720 a year .
but many female pensioners who qualify for the main pension credit will not qualify for the savings element because they have not made enough national insurance contributions towards their state pension .
this could also affect low-income men who for some reason have also not been able to pay their full amount of national insurance contributions .
government rule in order to receive the savings element of the credit , which is worth up to £ 13.80 a week , pensioners must be receiving income above the level of the full basic state pension .
this is because anyone on full pension would have automatically paid their full quota of national insurance contributions .
the government has defended this rule by saying that it must ensure the pension credit does not undermine the principle of paying national insurance contributions .
it told parliament recently : " we believe that it is right that people should first use their money to pay contribution to the basic state pension . "
how many could be affected ?
according to official figures , a typical pension for a woman at 60 is just £ 58 , and there are about four million pensioners currently receiving less than £ 70 a week from a basic state pension .
not all of these people will miss out on the savings element of the credit , but women approaching retirement who left work to care for children during the 1960s and early to mid-1970s could be big losers .
people getting less than the full basic state pension between £ 60 to £ 69.99:350,000 £ 50 to £ 59.99:400,000 £ 40 to £ 49.99:2.1m £ 30 to £ 39.99:250,000 less than £ 30:800,000 source : approximate figures based on dwp research and statistics since 1978 women who have stayed at home to look after children have received " home responsibilities protection " , which basically means the government will pay for their ni contributions during this time .
but women who cared for children before 1978 were not protected - and often receive very small basic pensions .
this also means that they might not have paid enough national insurance contributions to qualify for the savings element of the new credit . "
once again women are the poor relations in pensions policy " steve webb , liberal democrats because of this , steve webb , liberal democrat shadow work and pensions secretary , has tried to push through amendments to the pension credit rules .
he told bbc news online : " there is a whole group of people who have saved , women under 65 , women with poor state pension rights who will get little or no reward for their savings .
" once again women are the poor relations in pensions policy . "
another anomaly in another anomaly , women who receive the full basic state pension are not permitted to claim the savings element until they reach 65 .
under current regulations , women can draw their state pension at 60 .
from october 2003 , women between 60 and 64 will be able to receive the main part of the pension credit , but not the savings element .
sally west of age concern told bbc news online that this could lead to disappointment and confusion .
she said : " people will have heard about a pensions credit which rewards savings , and will be disappointed to find out they wo n't qualify for another five years . "
what is the pension credit ?
the government 's intention to create a pension credit was announced in the 2000 pre-budget report .
the credit is means tested and will reward single pensioners with net incomes of up to £ 135 a week and pensioner couples with £ 200 a week from october 2003 . "
they are saying an extra £ 2bn a year will be going to pensioners , but one wonders how much will be staying in the treasury coffers due to low take up " ben harding , help the aged the state pension credit bill has just received its third reading in the house of commons and must now go back to the house of lords .
but attempts to amend the anomalies penalising some women have proved unsuccessful .
