now chancellor schröder wants to see if voters do as well . eager to appear reform-ready in time for september 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder said he wants to make radical changes in germany 's troubled labor market an imminent reality .
with close to 4 million unemployed , pressure is on schröder 's social democrat and green party coalition government to act quickly .
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union have already made the high unemployment and germany 's slumping economy a campaign topic .
voters seem to have responded positively , giving the cdu / csu a solid lead in polls .
now schröder wants to reverse the flow .
the commission he set up four months ago to look into the country 's cluttered and bloated employment agencies has begun leaking out its list of measures , two months before their official release date .
among other things , the commission headed by volkswagen director peter hartz , recommends cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits after one year and the establishment of personal service agencies to streamline the job and aid search for the unemployed .
unemployed will be outfitted with chip cards that they can hand over to employment agencies to speed up the process .
hartz said the recommendations will halve the list of unemployed by 2005 and save billions in state-sponsored aid .
they have found a welcome reception among a business and political establishment that knows reform is needed .
schröder is hoping voters will realize that as well and announced over the weekend that the reforms could come into effect before the sept .

wishful thinking the latter might be wishful thinking .
the massive trade union ver.di has already voiced displeasure over aspects of the proposals .
union head frank bsirske told reuters on monday that his organization did n't believe in the dramatic reduction of benefits and wages .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , of the cdu / csu , accused schröder of trying to foist quick-fix promises onto the populace in an effort to cover up four years of incompetence in the labor market .
even hartz , schröder 's friend , has come out against weaving the proposals into the campaign battle .
" " our work is nonpartisan , and is focused on practical solutions , " hartz told der spiegel magazine .
" the concept will be presented so that it can be carried out after the elections – no matter who is in power . "
empty promises , quick fixes when he became chancellor , schröder promised to reduce unemployment down to 3.5 million .
his administration 's reputation has suffered for not meeting that very moderate goal .
revelations earlier this year that germany 's employment offices were inflating job placement figures caused a stir and led to the hartz commission 's creation .
schröder would love to take the ambitious promises the commission has made and test them out on the populace .

the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union have already made the high unemployment and germany 's slumping economy a campaign topic .
voters seem to have responded positively , giving the cdu / csu a solid lead in polls .
now schröder wants to reverse the flow .
the commission he set up four months ago to look into the country 's cluttered and bloated employment agencies has begun leaking out its list of measures , two months before their official release date .
among other things , the commission headed by volkswagen director peter hartz , recommends cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits after one year and the establishment of personal service agencies to streamline the job and aid search for the unemployed .
unemployed will be outfitted with chip cards that they can hand over to employment agencies to speed up the process .
hartz said the recommendations will halve the list of unemployed by 2005 and save billions in state-sponsored aid .
they have found a welcome reception among a business and political establishment that knows reform is needed .
schröder is hoping voters will realize that as well and announced over the weekend that the reforms could come into effect before the sept .

" the plan goes completely in the right direction , " he wrote in the social democratic party organ " vorwärts " .
he emphasized that it had to be adapted completely so that " not everyone picks out whatever matches up with their interests or demands . "
wishful thinking the latter might be wishful thinking .
the massive trade union ver.di has already voiced displeasure over aspects of the proposals .
union head frank bsirske told reuters on monday that his organization did n't believe in the dramatic reduction of benefits and wages .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , of the cdu / csu , accused schröder of trying to foist quick-fix promises onto the populace in an effort to cover up four years of incompetence in the labor market .
even hartz , schröder 's friend , has come out against weaving the proposals into the campaign battle .
" " our work is nonpartisan , and is focused on practical solutions , " hartz told der spiegel magazine .
" the concept will be presented so that it can be carried out after the elections – no matter who is in power . "
empty promises , quick fixes when he became chancellor , schröder promised to reduce unemployment down to 3.5 million .
his administration 's reputation has suffered for not meeting that very moderate goal .
revelations earlier this year that germany 's employment offices were inflating job placement figures caused a stir and led to the hartz commission 's creation .
schröder would love to take the ambitious promises the commission has made and test them out on the populace .
figures such as a 50 percent reduction in unemployment and 27 billion euro in savings are guaranteed to impress voters , but not as well as concrete reforms would .

the majority conceded that the brazilians simply outclassed the german team . pain pierced the hearts of millions of germans as the final whistle blew in yokohama yesterday and the stadium erupted in a sea of yellow and green .
thousands of cafes , bars and living rooms all over germany witnessed similar scenes – german fans with their hands clapped over their mouths , tears springing to their eyes , their beer forgotten as the shock and disappointment of losing out on the football world cup title sank in .
let 's party !
but despite the grief that settled on the nation , the majority of germans were quick to recover and swallow their disappointment .
" what the hell , being second isn ’ t that bad " – equipped with that motto , thousands of hard-core fans decided to party anyway , even to the sound of brazilian drums and samba .
no where was that more visible than in berlin , as the kudamm , the long commercial boulevard in the west , was brought to a standstill by thousands of fans dancing and blaring their car horns .
celebrating the end together and it wasn ’ t just the germans and the brazilians partying .
berlin 's sizeable turkish population decided to join in the party and celebrate the performance of their team ’ s win over south korea on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a colourful cultural carnival spontaneously sprung up on the boulevard as brazilians dressed in trademark green and yellow skimpy g-strings did the samba .
turkish fans raced up and down in their cars , hooting loudly and hanging their flag out and chanting " tuerkiye , tuerkiye . "
some 10,000 germans draped their red , black and gold tricolour around themselves and roared " deutschland " .
the beer flowed , firecrackers exploded and hardly anything seemed to dampen the high spirits .
not even some hundred sorely disappointed german fans who got into scuffles with the police and tried to deter their partying fellow citizens .
even the chancellor masks disappointment even german chancellor schröder , who has been trying to cash in on the " feel-good " factor and use every opportunity to show off his soccer skills , was determined to be positive on sunday .
schröder , who in recent times has often been photographed leaping for joy every time germany made a goal , said " i am not disappointed .
it was a great game by a fantastic team .
naturally there is a bit of nostalgia , it -lrb- germany ’ s victory -rrb- could have worked " .
german press moans the loss but germany ’ s press wasn ’ t as forgiving as the fans .
several mixed criticism of goal-keeper oliver kahn ’ s error with praise for a team no one expected to advance so far .
berlin ’ s " der tagesspiegel " wrote a simple headline : " germany , what a shame " .
" one mistake is a mistake too many " , read the headline in munich ’ s " süddeutsche zeitung . "
the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " proclaimed on its sports page , " kahn opens the gate for brazil ’ s fifth world cup title . "
in a commentary , the paper wrote that germany was the better team even though brazil had several brilliant individual players – " brazil is the world champion – germany has the best team in the world " .
" kahn ’ s tragic mistake " said the " bild " , germany ’ s largest selling newspaper that for weeks had praised the man to the skies with a series of blow-ups and headlines .
" the football god must be brazilian after all " , the paper said in a front-page article .
" we were so close " .
but all is not lost for a country no doubt smarting despite the take-it-in-your-stride attitude .

now chancellor schröder wants to see if voters do as well . eager to appear reform-ready in time for september 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder said he wants to make radical changes in germany 's troubled labor market an imminent reality .
with close to 4 million unemployed , pressure is on schröder 's social democrat and green party coalition government to act quickly .
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union have already made the high unemployment and germany 's slumping economy a campaign topic .
voters seem to have responded positively , giving the cdu / csu a solid lead in polls .
now schröder wants to reverse the flow .
the commission he set up four months ago to look into the country 's cluttered and bloated employment agencies has begun leaking out its list of measures , two months before their official release date .
among other things , the commission headed by volkswagen director peter hartz , recommends cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits after one year and the establishment of personal service agencies to streamline the job and aid search for the unemployed .
unemployed will be outfitted with chip cards that they can hand over to employment agencies to speed up the process .
hartz said the recommendations will halve the list of unemployed by 2005 and save billions in state-sponsored aid .
they have found a welcome reception among a business and political establishment that knows reform is needed .
schröder is hoping voters will realize that as well and announced over the weekend that the reforms could come into effect before the sept .
22 election .
the final report is due aug .
16 .
" the plan goes completely in the right direction , " he wrote in the social democratic party organ " vorwärts " .
he emphasized that it had to be adapted completely so that " not everyone picks out whatever matches up with their interests or demands . "
wishful thinking the latter might be wishful thinking .
the massive trade union ver.di has already voiced displeasure over aspects of the proposals .
union head frank bsirske told reuters on monday that his organization did n't believe in the dramatic reduction of benefits and wages .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , of the cdu / csu , accused schröder of trying to foist quick-fix promises onto the populace in an effort to cover up four years of incompetence in the labor market .
even hartz , schröder 's friend , has come out against weaving the proposals into the campaign battle .
" " our work is nonpartisan , and is focused on practical solutions , " hartz told der spiegel magazine .
" the concept will be presented so that it can be carried out after the elections – no matter who is in power . "
empty promises , quick fixes when he became chancellor , schröder promised to reduce unemployment down to 3.5 million .
his administration 's reputation has suffered for not meeting that very moderate goal .
revelations earlier this year that germany 's employment offices were inflating job placement figures caused a stir and led to the hartz commission 's creation .
schröder would love to take the ambitious promises the commission has made and test them out on the populace .
figures such as a 50 percent reduction in unemployment and 27 billion euro in savings are guaranteed to impress voters , but not as well as concrete reforms would .
whether he can get them out fast enough remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the majority conceded that the brazilians simply outclassed the german team . pain pierced the hearts of millions of germans as the final whistle blew in yokohama yesterday and the stadium erupted in a sea of yellow and green .
thousands of cafes , bars and living rooms all over germany witnessed similar scenes – german fans with their hands clapped over their mouths , tears springing to their eyes , their beer forgotten as the shock and disappointment of losing out on the football world cup title sank in .
let 's party !
but despite the grief that settled on the nation , the majority of germans were quick to recover and swallow their disappointment .
" what the hell , being second isn ’ t that bad " – equipped with that motto , thousands of hard-core fans decided to party anyway , even to the sound of brazilian drums and samba .
no where was that more visible than in berlin , as the kudamm , the long commercial boulevard in the west , was brought to a standstill by thousands of fans dancing and blaring their car horns .
celebrating the end together and it wasn ’ t just the germans and the brazilians partying .
berlin 's sizeable turkish population decided to join in the party and celebrate the performance of their team ’ s win over south korea on saturday .

now chancellor schröder wants to see if voters do as well . eager to appear reform-ready in time for september 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder said he wants to make radical changes in germany 's troubled labor market an imminent reality .
with close to 4 million unemployed , pressure is on schröder 's social democrat and green party coalition government to act quickly .
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union have already made the high unemployment and germany 's slumping economy a campaign topic .
voters seem to have responded positively , giving the cdu / csu a solid lead in polls .
now schröder wants to reverse the flow .
the commission he set up four months ago to look into the country 's cluttered and bloated employment agencies has begun leaking out its list of measures , two months before their official release date .
among other things , the commission headed by volkswagen director peter hartz , recommends cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits after one year and the establishment of personal service agencies to streamline the job and aid search for the unemployed .
unemployed will be outfitted with chip cards that they can hand over to employment agencies to speed up the process .
hartz said the recommendations will halve the list of unemployed by 2005 and save billions in state-sponsored aid .
they have found a welcome reception among a business and political establishment that knows reform is needed .
schröder is hoping voters will realize that as well and announced over the weekend that the reforms could come into effect before the sept .
22 election .
the final report is due aug .
16 .
" the plan goes completely in the right direction , " he wrote in the social democratic party organ " vorwärts " .
he emphasized that it had to be adapted completely so that " not everyone picks out whatever matches up with their interests or demands . "
wishful thinking the latter might be wishful thinking .
the massive trade union ver.di has already voiced displeasure over aspects of the proposals .
union head frank bsirske told reuters on monday that his organization did n't believe in the dramatic reduction of benefits and wages .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , of the cdu / csu , accused schröder of trying to foist quick-fix promises onto the populace in an effort to cover up four years of incompetence in the labor market .
even hartz , schröder 's friend , has come out against weaving the proposals into the campaign battle .
" " our work is nonpartisan , and is focused on practical solutions , " hartz told der spiegel magazine .
" the concept will be presented so that it can be carried out after the elections – no matter who is in power . "
empty promises , quick fixes when he became chancellor , schröder promised to reduce unemployment down to 3.5 million .
his administration 's reputation has suffered for not meeting that very moderate goal .
revelations earlier this year that germany 's employment offices were inflating job placement figures caused a stir and led to the hartz commission 's creation .
schröder would love to take the ambitious promises the commission has made and test them out on the populace .
figures such as a 50 percent reduction in unemployment and 27 billion euro in savings are guaranteed to impress voters , but not as well as concrete reforms would .

now chancellor schröder wants to see if voters do as well . eager to appear reform-ready in time for september 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder said he wants to make radical changes in germany 's troubled labor market an imminent reality .
with close to 4 million unemployed , pressure is on schröder 's social democrat and green party coalition government to act quickly .
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union have already made the high unemployment and germany 's slumping economy a campaign topic .
voters seem to have responded positively , giving the cdu / csu a solid lead in polls .
now schröder wants to reverse the flow .
the commission he set up four months ago to look into the country 's cluttered and bloated employment agencies has begun leaking out its list of measures , two months before their official release date .
among other things , the commission headed by volkswagen director peter hartz , recommends cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits after one year and the establishment of personal service agencies to streamline the job and aid search for the unemployed .
unemployed will be outfitted with chip cards that they can hand over to employment agencies to speed up the process .
hartz said the recommendations will halve the list of unemployed by 2005 and save billions in state-sponsored aid .
they have found a welcome reception among a business and political establishment that knows reform is needed .
schröder is hoping voters will realize that as well and announced over the weekend that the reforms could come into effect before the sept .

" the plan goes completely in the right direction , " he wrote in the social democratic party organ " vorwärts " .
he emphasized that it had to be adapted completely so that " not everyone picks out whatever matches up with their interests or demands . "
wishful thinking the latter might be wishful thinking .
the massive trade union ver.di has already voiced displeasure over aspects of the proposals .
union head frank bsirske told reuters on monday that his organization did n't believe in the dramatic reduction of benefits and wages .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , of the cdu / csu , accused schröder of trying to foist quick-fix promises onto the populace in an effort to cover up four years of incompetence in the labor market .
even hartz , schröder 's friend , has come out against weaving the proposals into the campaign battle .
" " our work is nonpartisan , and is focused on practical solutions , " hartz told der spiegel magazine .
" the concept will be presented so that it can be carried out after the elections – no matter who is in power . "
empty promises , quick fixes when he became chancellor , schröder promised to reduce unemployment down to 3.5 million .
his administration 's reputation has suffered for not meeting that very moderate goal .
revelations earlier this year that germany 's employment offices were inflating job placement figures caused a stir and led to the hartz commission 's creation .
schröder would love to take the ambitious promises the commission has made and test them out on the populace .

the majority conceded that the brazilians simply outclassed the german team . pain pierced the hearts of millions of germans as the final whistle blew in yokohama yesterday and the stadium erupted in a sea of yellow and green .
thousands of cafes , bars and living rooms all over germany witnessed similar scenes – german fans with their hands clapped over their mouths , tears springing to their eyes , their beer forgotten as the shock and disappointment of losing out on the football world cup title sank in .
let 's party !
but despite the grief that settled on the nation , the majority of germans were quick to recover and swallow their disappointment .
" what the hell , being second isn ’ t that bad " – equipped with that motto , thousands of hard-core fans decided to party anyway , even to the sound of brazilian drums and samba .
no where was that more visible than in berlin , as the kudamm , the long commercial boulevard in the west , was brought to a standstill by thousands of fans dancing and blaring their car horns .
celebrating the end together and it wasn ’ t just the germans and the brazilians partying .
berlin 's sizeable turkish population decided to join in the party and celebrate the performance of their team ’ s win over south korea on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a colourful cultural carnival spontaneously sprung up on the boulevard as brazilians dressed in trademark green and yellow skimpy g-strings did the samba .
turkish fans raced up and down in their cars , hooting loudly and hanging their flag out and chanting " tuerkiye , tuerkiye . "
some 10,000 germans draped their red , black and gold tricolour around themselves and roared " deutschland " .
the beer flowed , firecrackers exploded and hardly anything seemed to dampen the high spirits .
not even some hundred sorely disappointed german fans who got into scuffles with the police and tried to deter their partying fellow citizens .
even the chancellor masks disappointment even german chancellor schröder , who has been trying to cash in on the " feel-good " factor and use every opportunity to show off his soccer skills , was determined to be positive on sunday .
schröder , who in recent times has often been photographed leaping for joy every time germany made a goal , said " i am not disappointed .
it was a great game by a fantastic team .
naturally there is a bit of nostalgia , it -lrb- germany ’ s victory -rrb- could have worked " .
german press moans the loss but germany ’ s press wasn ’ t as forgiving as the fans .
several mixed criticism of goal-keeper oliver kahn ’ s error with praise for a team no one expected to advance so far .
berlin ’ s " der tagesspiegel " wrote a simple headline : " germany , what a shame " .
" one mistake is a mistake too many " , read the headline in munich ’ s " süddeutsche zeitung . "
the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " proclaimed on its sports page , " kahn opens the gate for brazil ’ s fifth world cup title . "
in a commentary , the paper wrote that germany was the better team even though brazil had several brilliant individual players – " brazil is the world champion – germany has the best team in the world " .
" kahn ’ s tragic mistake " said the " bild " , germany ’ s largest selling newspaper that for weeks had praised the man to the skies with a series of blow-ups and headlines .

now chancellor schröder wants to see if voters do as well . eager to appear reform-ready in time for september 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder said he wants to make radical changes in germany 's troubled labor market an imminent reality .
with close to 4 million unemployed , pressure is on schröder 's social democrat and green party coalition government to act quickly .
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union have already made the high unemployment and germany 's slumping economy a campaign topic .
voters seem to have responded positively , giving the cdu / csu a solid lead in polls .
now schröder wants to reverse the flow .
the commission he set up four months ago to look into the country 's cluttered and bloated employment agencies has begun leaking out its list of measures , two months before their official release date .
among other things , the commission headed by volkswagen director peter hartz , recommends cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits after one year and the establishment of personal service agencies to streamline the job and aid search for the unemployed .
unemployed will be outfitted with chip cards that they can hand over to employment agencies to speed up the process .
hartz said the recommendations will halve the list of unemployed by 2005 and save billions in state-sponsored aid .
they have found a welcome reception among a business and political establishment that knows reform is needed .
schröder is hoping voters will realize that as well and announced over the weekend that the reforms could come into effect before the sept .
22 election .
the final report is due aug .
16 .
" the plan goes completely in the right direction , " he wrote in the social democratic party organ " vorwärts " .
he emphasized that it had to be adapted completely so that " not everyone picks out whatever matches up with their interests or demands . "
wishful thinking the latter might be wishful thinking .
the massive trade union ver.di has already voiced displeasure over aspects of the proposals .
union head frank bsirske told reuters on monday that his organization did n't believe in the dramatic reduction of benefits and wages .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , of the cdu / csu , accused schröder of trying to foist quick-fix promises onto the populace in an effort to cover up four years of incompetence in the labor market .
even hartz , schröder 's friend , has come out against weaving the proposals into the campaign battle .
" " our work is nonpartisan , and is focused on practical solutions , " hartz told der spiegel magazine .
" the concept will be presented so that it can be carried out after the elections – no matter who is in power . "
empty promises , quick fixes when he became chancellor , schröder promised to reduce unemployment down to 3.5 million .
his administration 's reputation has suffered for not meeting that very moderate goal .
revelations earlier this year that germany 's employment offices were inflating job placement figures caused a stir and led to the hartz commission 's creation .
schröder would love to take the ambitious promises the commission has made and test them out on the populace .
figures such as a 50 percent reduction in unemployment and 27 billion euro in savings are guaranteed to impress voters , but not as well as concrete reforms would .

now chancellor schröder wants to see if voters do as well . eager to appear reform-ready in time for september 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder said he wants to make radical changes in germany 's troubled labor market an imminent reality .
with close to 4 million unemployed , pressure is on schröder 's social democrat and green party coalition government to act quickly .
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union have already made the high unemployment and germany 's slumping economy a campaign topic .
voters seem to have responded positively , giving the cdu / csu a solid lead in polls .
now schröder wants to reverse the flow .
the commission he set up four months ago to look into the country 's cluttered and bloated employment agencies has begun leaking out its list of measures , two months before their official release date .
among other things , the commission headed by volkswagen director peter hartz , recommends cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits after one year and the establishment of personal service agencies to streamline the job and aid search for the unemployed .
unemployed will be outfitted with chip cards that they can hand over to employment agencies to speed up the process .
hartz said the recommendations will halve the list of unemployed by 2005 and save billions in state-sponsored aid .
they have found a welcome reception among a business and political establishment that knows reform is needed .
schröder is hoping voters will realize that as well and announced over the weekend that the reforms could come into effect before the sept .
22 election .
the final report is due aug .
16 .
" the plan goes completely in the right direction , " he wrote in the social democratic party organ " vorwärts " .
he emphasized that it had to be adapted completely so that " not everyone picks out whatever matches up with their interests or demands . "
wishful thinking the latter might be wishful thinking .
the massive trade union ver.di has already voiced displeasure over aspects of the proposals .
union head frank bsirske told reuters on monday that his organization did n't believe in the dramatic reduction of benefits and wages .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , of the cdu / csu , accused schröder of trying to foist quick-fix promises onto the populace in an effort to cover up four years of incompetence in the labor market .
even hartz , schröder 's friend , has come out against weaving the proposals into the campaign battle .
" " our work is nonpartisan , and is focused on practical solutions , " hartz told der spiegel magazine .
" the concept will be presented so that it can be carried out after the elections – no matter who is in power . "
empty promises , quick fixes when he became chancellor , schröder promised to reduce unemployment down to 3.5 million .
his administration 's reputation has suffered for not meeting that very moderate goal .
revelations earlier this year that germany 's employment offices were inflating job placement figures caused a stir and led to the hartz commission 's creation .
schröder would love to take the ambitious promises the commission has made and test them out on the populace .
figures such as a 50 percent reduction in unemployment and 27 billion euro in savings are guaranteed to impress voters , but not as well as concrete reforms would .
whether he can get them out fast enough remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the majority conceded that the brazilians simply outclassed the german team . pain pierced the hearts of millions of germans as the final whistle blew in yokohama yesterday and the stadium erupted in a sea of yellow and green .
thousands of cafes , bars and living rooms all over germany witnessed similar scenes – german fans with their hands clapped over their mouths , tears springing to their eyes , their beer forgotten as the shock and disappointment of losing out on the football world cup title sank in .
let 's party !
but despite the grief that settled on the nation , the majority of germans were quick to recover and swallow their disappointment .
" what the hell , being second isn ’ t that bad " – equipped with that motto , thousands of hard-core fans decided to party anyway , even to the sound of brazilian drums and samba .
no where was that more visible than in berlin , as the kudamm , the long commercial boulevard in the west , was brought to a standstill by thousands of fans dancing and blaring their car horns .
celebrating the end together and it wasn ’ t just the germans and the brazilians partying .
berlin 's sizeable turkish population decided to join in the party and celebrate the performance of their team ’ s win over south korea on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a colourful cultural carnival spontaneously sprung up on the boulevard as brazilians dressed in trademark green and yellow skimpy g-strings did the samba .
turkish fans raced up and down in their cars , hooting loudly and hanging their flag out and chanting " tuerkiye , tuerkiye . "
some 10,000 germans draped their red , black and gold tricolour around themselves and roared " deutschland " .
the beer flowed , firecrackers exploded and hardly anything seemed to dampen the high spirits .
not even some hundred sorely disappointed german fans who got into scuffles with the police and tried to deter their partying fellow citizens .
even the chancellor masks disappointment even german chancellor schröder , who has been trying to cash in on the " feel-good " factor and use every opportunity to show off his soccer skills , was determined to be positive on sunday .
schröder , who in recent times has often been photographed leaping for joy every time germany made a goal , said " i am not disappointed .
it was a great game by a fantastic team .
naturally there is a bit of nostalgia , it -lrb- germany ’ s victory -rrb- could have worked " .
german press moans the loss but germany ’ s press wasn ’ t as forgiving as the fans .
several mixed criticism of goal-keeper oliver kahn ’ s error with praise for a team no one expected to advance so far .
berlin ’ s " der tagesspiegel " wrote a simple headline : " germany , what a shame " .
" one mistake is a mistake too many " , read the headline in munich ’ s " süddeutsche zeitung . "
the " frankfurter allgemeine zeitung " proclaimed on its sports page , " kahn opens the gate for brazil ’ s fifth world cup title . "
in a commentary , the paper wrote that germany was the better team even though brazil had several brilliant individual players – " brazil is the world champion – germany has the best team in the world " .
" kahn ’ s tragic mistake " said the " bild " , germany ’ s largest selling newspaper that for weeks had praised the man to the skies with a series of blow-ups and headlines .
" the football god must be brazilian after all " , the paper said in a front-page article .
" we were so close " .
but all is not lost for a country no doubt smarting despite the take-it-in-your-stride attitude .
there will be renewed hope of victory for german fans when germany hosts the 2006 soccer world cup . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

now schröder wants to reverse the flow .
the commission he set up four months ago to look into the country 's cluttered and bloated employment agencies has begun leaking out its list of measures , two months before their official release date .
among other things , the commission headed by volkswagen director peter hartz , recommends cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits after one year and the establishment of personal service agencies to streamline the job and aid search for the unemployed .
unemployed will be outfitted with chip cards that they can hand over to employment agencies to speed up the process .
hartz said the recommendations will halve the list of unemployed by 2005 and save billions in state-sponsored aid .
they have found a welcome reception among a business and political establishment that knows reform is needed .
schröder is hoping voters will realize that as well and announced over the weekend that the reforms could come into effect before the sept .
22 election .
the final report is due aug .
16 .
" the plan goes completely in the right direction , " he wrote in the social democratic party organ " vorwärts " .
he emphasized that it had to be adapted completely so that " not everyone picks out whatever matches up with their interests or demands . "
wishful thinking the latter might be wishful thinking .
the massive trade union ver.di has already voiced displeasure over aspects of the proposals .
union head frank bsirske told reuters on monday that his organization did n't believe in the dramatic reduction of benefits and wages .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , of the cdu / csu , accused schröder of trying to foist quick-fix promises onto the populace in an effort to cover up four years of incompetence in the labor market .
even hartz , schröder 's friend , has come out against weaving the proposals into the campaign battle .
" " our work is nonpartisan , and is focused on practical solutions , " hartz told der spiegel magazine .
" the concept will be presented so that it can be carried out after the elections – no matter who is in power . "
empty promises , quick fixes when he became chancellor , schröder promised to reduce unemployment down to 3.5 million .
his administration 's reputation has suffered for not meeting that very moderate goal .
revelations earlier this year that germany 's employment offices were inflating job placement figures caused a stir and led to the hartz commission 's creation .
schröder would love to take the ambitious promises the commission has made and test them out on the populace .
figures such as a 50 percent reduction in unemployment and 27 billion euro in savings are guaranteed to impress voters , but not as well as concrete reforms would .
whether he can get them out fast enough remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

now chancellor schröder wants to see if voters do as well . eager to appear reform-ready in time for september 's elections , chancellor gerhard schröder said he wants to make radical changes in germany 's troubled labor market an imminent reality .
with close to 4 million unemployed , pressure is on schröder 's social democrat and green party coalition government to act quickly .
the opposition christian democratic union and christian social union have already made the high unemployment and germany 's slumping economy a campaign topic .
voters seem to have responded positively , giving the cdu / csu a solid lead in polls .
now schröder wants to reverse the flow .
the commission he set up four months ago to look into the country 's cluttered and bloated employment agencies has begun leaking out its list of measures , two months before their official release date .
among other things , the commission headed by volkswagen director peter hartz , recommends cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits after one year and the establishment of personal service agencies to streamline the job and aid search for the unemployed .
unemployed will be outfitted with chip cards that they can hand over to employment agencies to speed up the process .
hartz said the recommendations will halve the list of unemployed by 2005 and save billions in state-sponsored aid .
they have found a welcome reception among a business and political establishment that knows reform is needed .
schröder is hoping voters will realize that as well and announced over the weekend that the reforms could come into effect before the sept .

" the plan goes completely in the right direction , " he wrote in the social democratic party organ " vorwärts " .
he emphasized that it had to be adapted completely so that " not everyone picks out whatever matches up with their interests or demands . "
wishful thinking the latter might be wishful thinking .
the massive trade union ver.di has already voiced displeasure over aspects of the proposals .
union head frank bsirske told reuters on monday that his organization did n't believe in the dramatic reduction of benefits and wages .
chancellor candidate edmund stoiber , of the cdu / csu , accused schröder of trying to foist quick-fix promises onto the populace in an effort to cover up four years of incompetence in the labor market .
even hartz , schröder 's friend , has come out against weaving the proposals into the campaign battle .
" " our work is nonpartisan , and is focused on practical solutions , " hartz told der spiegel magazine .
" the concept will be presented so that it can be carried out after the elections – no matter who is in power . "
empty promises , quick fixes when he became chancellor , schröder promised to reduce unemployment down to 3.5 million .
his administration 's reputation has suffered for not meeting that very moderate goal .
revelations earlier this year that germany 's employment offices were inflating job placement figures caused a stir and led to the hartz commission 's creation .
schröder would love to take the ambitious promises the commission has made and test them out on the populace .
figures such as a 50 percent reduction in unemployment and 27 billion euro in savings are guaranteed to impress voters , but not as well as concrete reforms would .

"
chairman arafat was not doing enough to end the terror " colin powell speaking on american television on sunday , colin powell said mr arafat did not provide the kind of leadership necessary to move forward .
mr powell 's comments came after controversial calls by president george w bush last week for the palestinian people to replace their leadership .
in continuing violence in the west bank , israeli troops killed a leader of the militant islamic group hamas in a raid on a house in nablus .
israel said muhanad al-taher , 26 , was one of the organisation 's top bomb-makers and was responsible for the deaths of more than 100 israelis in suicide attacks .
hamas vowed to avenge mr al-taher 's death , saying the " assassination will increase hamas ' determination to continue jihad and resistance " .
' flawed ' in the interview with fox news , mr powell said us officials were currently talking to a variety of palestinian leaders .
but , he said , there had been no conversations with mr arafat since president bush 's speech on middle east policy last monday .
asked if he thought there would be any in the future , the secretary of state replied : " i do n't expect so because his leadership is flawed . "
he accused the palestinian leader of not providing the kind of leadership necessary to move forward .
" leadership comes with responsibility , and responsibility is to lead your people in new , positive direction ...
chairman arafat has not done that , " mr powell said .
' palestinian reservations ' mr powell said he had talked to the palestinian leader two months ago about the necessity to move in a new direction in order for the us to be able to help him .
advice , mr powell said , the palestinian leader had not heeded .
" quite the contrary .
every time we got something going , the terror came back .
" and chairman arafat was not doing enough to end the terror , either through the power of his voice , his position within the palestinian community , or the use of the institutions that were available to him . "
mr powell said some palestinian leaders were coming forward and expressing reservations about the kind of leadership they had received in recent years .
a palestinian authority official , ahmed abdul rahman , urged all palestinians not to meet mr powell or any israeli officials as long as the palestinian people were , as he put it , under siege .
mr arafat , who has announced elections for january , says it is impossible to carry out the reforms demanded by the us with the israeli military occupying palestinian-administered territories .

the deepening realisation of the number of cases of sexual abuse perpetrated by priests is a cause of grief and shame to all of us church letter of apology in a formal letter read and distributed at masses around the country , new zealand 's bishops expressed " grief and shame " over past cases of sexual abuse involving members of the clergy .
the church has confirmed 38 cases of sexual abuse by priests , brothers and lay church members going back over several decades .
in their letter , the bishops deplored " past mistakes " and the way the church had handled abuse complaints " the deepening realisation of the number of cases of sexual abuse perpetrated by priests is a cause of grief and shame to all of us , " the letter said .
" the betrayal of trust and the harm that has been done , especially to the young and the vulnerable fills us , your bishops , with a deep sense of sadness and betrayal . "
" to those who are victims of abuse , and to their families , we express our deepest regret and most sincere apology . "

a lot of priests and a lot of brothers knew what was going on but they kept quiet about it - and that 's wrong patrick , alleged abuse victim and the church is promising to help complainants take the matter to the police if they want to .

patrick , now 51 , was sent to marylands , a christchurch residential school for slow learners , in the late 1950s and early 1960s .
the newspaper said the school was run by the st john of god order , and it was there , in an upstairs room , that a catholic brother allegedly sexually abused patrick .
brother william lebler , now in his 80s and living in australia , has denied the allegations .
the new zealand herald reported that when patrick went forward as an adult with the abuse allegations , st john of god responded by offering him $ 30,000 on condition he keep quiet about his claims .

wendy morris , the mother of the builder 's three children , claims morris is innocent .
morris , 40 was sentenced to four life sentences at swansea crown court on friday for the " massacre " of four members of the same family .
mandy power , 34 , her disabled 80-year-old mother and her daughters katie , 10 , and emily , eight , were battered to death in june 1999 when builder david morris embarked on an " orgy of savagery " .
mrs morris from penlan in swansea - along with other family and friends - has raised a 200-signature petition asking for a retrial .
" he is not a murderer .
i 'm absolutely positive .
" i 've seen him in drink and drugs and he is not that sort of person " she said .
" we 've already got 200 names on the petition and we 're not going to give up to prove he is innocent . "
meanwhile , prayers were said on sunday at st mary 's church in clydach aiming to heal some of the emotional wounds uncovered by the horrifying details revealed during the trial .
the man leading the service called on the community to continue to show courage and patience as the reality of morris 's conviction sinks in .
fresh floral tributes marking the third anniversary last thursday of the brutal killings have been laid outside the family home in kelvin road .
reverend tim hewitt , the church 's vicar , held the funeral for the four victims and was asked by relatives to be their media spokesman in the weeks following the tragedy .
he said the loss of mrs power and her family was still affecting the community .
but his advice for his congregation was to continue watching the course of the judicial process unfold .
the village a few miles north of swansea is divided over morris 's conviction for the extraordinarily vicious crime which shocked the nation .
some still point the finger at mrs power 's secret lover , alison lewis , who was a serving policewoman at the time of the murders .
she along with her ex-husband and his twin brother , also both serving police officers were held in july 2000 and questioned about the killings .
friday 's unanimous jury verdict has done little to quell suspicions that people other than morris were involved in either the killings or the near-successful attempt to clean the scene of forensic evidence .
' show courage ' but rev hewitt urged the community to be patient .
" i think they have learnt to be patient and to show courage , and to wait for things to take their course .
" and i think the community will carry on it that way , being patient .
" when it wants to draw a line under the events , what i think it wants to do is to have the time and the space to begin a new step forward . "
meanwhile , david morris 's girlfriend is recovering at home in the north of england after taking an overdose of sleeping tablets .
thirty-three year-old mandy jewell was admitted to hospital in swansea shortly after sentence was announced .
but she was discharged on saturday and returned to her native halifax .

telstra bought the remaining 40 % stake in csl from hong kong 's telecoms giant , pacific century cyberworks -lrb- pccw -rrb- .
the deal terminates the two telecoms firms ' wireless partnership , which targeted joint expansion throughout the region .
pccw admitted the deal was about trying to reduce its us $ 5bn debt mountain .
mike butcher , pccw 's chief operating officer , said the markets were now more worried about financial fundaments rather than growth prospects .
spearheading growth telecoms firms ran up massive debts during a period of intense expansion at the height of the telecoms boom .
and pccw has been struggling under the debt incurred by acquiring hong kong 's former telecom monopoly , cable & wireless .
the firm 's strategy shift to reduce debt has enabled telstra to pick up a valuable asset .
" csl is profitable and debt free , and has a strong reputation in the asian region , " said telstra chief executive ziggy switowski .
" csl will be a major spearhead for our wireless growth strategy in asia , " he added .
csl has a subscriber base of 1.1 million , including the biggest share of high-spending business customers .

telstra bought the remaining 40 % stake in csl from hong kong 's telecoms giant , pacific century cyberworks -lrb- pccw -rrb- .
the deal terminates the two telecoms firms ' wireless partnership , which targeted joint expansion throughout the region .
pccw admitted the deal was about trying to reduce its us $ 5bn debt mountain .
mike butcher , pccw 's chief operating officer , said the markets were now more worried about financial fundaments rather than growth prospects .
spearheading growth telecoms firms ran up massive debts during a period of intense expansion at the height of the telecoms boom .
and pccw has been struggling under the debt incurred by acquiring hong kong 's former telecom monopoly , cable & wireless .
the firm 's strategy shift to reduce debt has enabled telstra to pick up a valuable asset .
" csl is profitable and debt free , and has a strong reputation in the asian region , " said telstra chief executive ziggy switowski .
" csl will be a major spearhead for our wireless growth strategy in asia , " he added .
csl has a subscriber base of 1.1 million , including the biggest share of high-spending business customers .

the law is being tightened to help protect vulnerable children after a campaign by the former education secretary gillian shephard .
ministers have amended the education bill , which is passing through the house of lords , to make the changes .
teachers already have guidelines which say they have a responsibility to report signs of abuse but these are now to be changed to legal requirements .
manslaughter gillian shephard took up the campaign after teachers at a norfolk primary school did not report signs of abuse on a six-year-old girl who was eventually killed by her stepmother .
tracey wright , 31 , was jailed for 15 years for the manslaughter of her stepdaughter lauren wright by norwich crown court .
lauren 's father craig wright was also convicted of manslaughter and wilful neglect and was given a lesser sentence .
guidelines to protect vulnerable children obviously needed to have the force of law gillian shephard mp the court heard the child had suffered months of abuse at the hands of tracey wright and had died after being hit so hard in the stomach that her digestive system collapsed .
there were more than 60 bruises and marks on her body and in the year before she died , she was said to have lost a lot of weight .
norfolk social services and the local health authority were both heavily criticised after her death for not recognising signs of abuse .
neighbours had warned social services that lauren was being abused seven weeks before she died but no action was taken .
she had been known to social services from a young age .
bruises local mp gillian shephard says teachers could also have done something to help .
" lauren attended the william marshall primary school at welney for the last 16 months of her life , " said mrs shephard .
" during that time she lost four stones and frequently appeared at school with bruises .
" the head and teachers did not apparently report these symptoms to the education welfare service as local authority guidelines required them to .
" the director of education told me that he was unable to take any disciplinary action against the teachers as the guidelines did not have any statutory force .
enforcement " i decided then to try to get the law changed .
guidelines to protect vulnerable children obviously needed to have the force of law .
" their disregard should result in disciplinary action against those concerned . "
norfolk county council 's director of education , bryan slater , said he welcomed the change in the law .
" i agree with mrs shephard that we could give the guidelines more force by making their observance a statutory responsibility in the same way that schools already have a statutory responsibility to deliver a national curriculum , " he said .
union reaction mixed eamonn o 'kane , general secretary of the national association of schoolmasters union of women teachers warned that changes in the law could mean schools and teachers being sued .
he said teachers could already be disciplined under 1995 department for education guidance on what to do about abuse , so no change in the law was necessary .
he said : " we believe it is a mistake to write into legislation a duty which has arisen from an admittedly tragic case .
" no-one is arguing about that and i 'm not defending the school but hard cases make bad law .
" it could be a further rod for the back of schools . "
the national union of teachers said it was not opposed to the law being changed to incorporate the guidance , providing schools were given the necessary resources .
general secretary doug mcavoy said : " we would want to be sure that appropriate funding for training for teachers to be able to live up to this demand was available . "

he was speaking as hong kong 's chief executive , tung chee-hwa , was sworn in for a new five-year term on monday .
mr tung himself admitted that the past five years had been difficult ones for hong kong .
and that sentiment was echoed in the angry protests nearby by pro-democracy activists , who are concerned that hong kong 's freedoms are being eroded by beijing rule .
surprise reprimand the bbc 's correspondent in hong kong , damian grammaticas , says that president jiang surprised many when he delivered some carefully-worded criticisms of the hong kong administration .
the president said that hoped the executive , legislative and judicial bodies would constantly improve their job performances to provide better services to society .
and he had criticisms too for hong kong 's people , calling on them to become " better masters " of their territory , and to help the development of the motherland .
in the past five years , the territory 's economy has taken a battering .
property prices - a major source of wealth - have fallen by half , unemployment has tripled and many people 's wages are being cut .
our correspondent says there is a real sense of pessimism that hong kong has lost its way .
tung 's rallying cry but mr tung said that despite the territory 's present difficulties " we need not be pessimistic " .
" we ca n't stand still ...
we have to forge ahead . "
he pledged to uphold hong kong 's constitution , known as the basic law , and to remain accountable to beijing , as a band struck up and the flags of hong kong and china were raised by the waterfront .
mr tung has recently completed an overhaul of his administration , replacing civil servants with political appointees whom critics worry will increase the chief executive 's power .
protests demonstrators out of earshot of the ceremonies railed against the close ties between hong kong and beijing .
" down with jiang zemin , " dozens of activists chanted as they marched with a mock coffin condemning china 's " murderous regime " .
about 100 practitioners of the falun gong spiritual movement performed a silent appeal for beijing to stop its crackdown on the group .
though illegal in mainland china , falun gong is officially tolerated in hong kong .
nevertheless , the hong kong government is busy prosecuting falun gong members and local political activists for staging public demonstrations .
and about 100 falun gong members who have arrived in hong kong over the last 10 days to join demonstrations have been deported .

campaigners are alleged to have visited pubs in the south wales village on saturday night in an attempt to get a petition signed in support of david morris , which was started by his former wife , wendy .
mr morris ' family said it was not aware of any of its supporters being in the village .
morris , 40 , was sentenced to four life sentences at swansea crown court on friday for the " massacre " of four members of the same family in june 1999 .
mandy power , 34 , her disabled 80-year-old mother and her daughters katie , 10 , and emily , eight , were battered to death when morris embarked on an " orgy of savagery " .
mrs morris from penlan in swansea - along with other family and friends - has raised a 350-signature petition backing a retrial .
but community councillor sylvia lewis said morris ' supporters had no business being in clydach , saying it was an " insult " to the families of the victims .
criticism " it is sad they were in this village trying to drum up from support - stay away from clydach , let us get back on track , " said cllr lewis .
" they were apparently on licensed premises , looking for people who had had a drink , asking them to sign a petition .

debra morris , david morris ' sister , denied any family supporters had visited clydach to get the petition signed .
but wendy morris said : " he is not a murderer .
i 'm absolutely positive .
" i 've seen him in drink and drugs and he is not that sort of person , " she said .
meanwhile , prayers were said on sunday at st mary 's church in clydach aiming to heal some of the emotional wounds uncovered by the horrifying details revealed during the trial .
the man leading the service called on the community to continue to show courage and patience as the reality of morris 's conviction sinks in .
fresh floral tributes marking the third anniversary last thursday of the brutal killings have been laid outside the family home in kelvin road .
reverend tim hewitt , the church 's vicar , held the funeral for the four victims and was asked by relatives to be their media spokesman in the weeks following the tragedy .
he said the loss of mrs power and her family was still affecting the community .
but his advice for his congregation was to continue watching the course of the judicial process unfold .
the village - a few miles north of swansea - is divided over morris 's conviction for the extraordinarily vicious crime which shocked the nation .
friday 's unanimous jury verdict has done little to quell suspicions that people other than morris were involved in either the killings or the near-successful attempt to clean the scene of forensic evidence .
' show courage ' but rev hewitt urged the community to be patient .
" i think they have learnt to be patient and to show courage , and to wait for things to take their course .
" and i think the community will carry on it that way , being patient . "
meanwhile , david morris 's girlfriend is recovering at home in the north of england after taking an overdose of sleeping tablets .
thirty-three year-old mandy jewell was admitted to hospital in swansea shortly after the sentence was announced .
but she was discharged on saturday and returned to her native halifax .
