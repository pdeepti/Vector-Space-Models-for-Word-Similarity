germany 's newly completed rail link between cologne and frankfurt could provide the impetus for a europe-wide high-speed rail network . with a price tag of around 6 billion euro , the german rail system ’ s new baby has not come cheap .
but the deutsche bahn says it ’ s made history , taking only six years to build the new high-speed link between cologne and frankfurt .
after a year ’ s delay due to leaking tunnels and the construction of noise barriers , commuters are looking forward to using the link from 1 august when they 'll be able to travel at heartstopping speeds of 300 kms / hr and cut the journey between the two cities from over two hours to only seventy-six minutes .
the time saved does n't come without a sacrifice .
there 'll be no more romantic views of the rhine - one fifth of the journey will be spent speeding through tunnels , and the rest mostly through hilly sections of forest .
but passengers will be saving about one hour and as the saying goes , ‘ time is money ’ .
paying for speed a single economy ticket on the new rail link will cost 51 euro .
passengers currently pay 39 euro for the trip .
deutsche bahn admits that students and holiday-makers won ’ t welcome the price increase .
but it says it ’ s confident the new trains will be full .
deutsche bahn ’ s marketing director hartmut herdan says the aim of the service is to attract people , mainly business travellers , away from using their cars .
as much of the track runs alongside the autobahn between frankfurt and cologne , the high-speed train will be very visible competition .
gauging success german business and industry have cautiously welcomed the new rail link , but they say it ’ s too early to predict how the economy in the region will be affected .
some residents are angry that trains won ’ t be stopping in bonn , the nation ’ s former capital .
some towns along the old route fear they could tourism revenues as the new route bypasses them .
deutsche bahn has run a concerted campaign to counter opposition to the project .
the chancellor gerhard schröder will do his bit to promote the link next thursday when he will be among its first official passengers .
potential sceptics , chiefly young people , are being attracted with offers of prizes including tickets to a rock concert and opportunities to experience the journey from the train ’ s ‘ cockpit ’ .
harmonisation on track the new cologne-frankfurt link could be the centrepiece of a future europe-wide high-speed rail network .
a new european high-speed train is being developed which combines the french tgv with germany ’ s ice .
deutsche bahn has released three entirely different series of ice in the past decade .
the first-generation of sleek , white trains began operating in 1991 and quickly became the flagship of germany ’ s long-distance rail system .
now more than 200 of the high-tech trains operate across the country .
a feast of figures eighteen new bridges and thirty tunnels had to be built for the new rail link .
the longest tunnel is 4.5 kms .
the tallest bridge is 992 metres .
the new track is 45 kms shorter than the present route which follows the rhine .
300,000 tonnes of steel were used to build the track .
the project cost 6 billion euro .

germany 's newly completed rail link between cologne and frankfurt could provide the impetus for a europe-wide high-speed rail network . with a price tag of around 6 billion euro , the german rail system ’ s new baby has not come cheap .
but the deutsche bahn says it ’ s made history , taking only six years to build the new high-speed link between cologne and frankfurt .
after a year ’ s delay due to leaking tunnels and the construction of noise barriers , commuters are looking forward to using the link from 1 august when they 'll be able to travel at heartstopping speeds of 300 kms / hr and cut the journey between the two cities from over two hours to only seventy-six minutes .
the time saved does n't come without a sacrifice .

germany 's newly completed rail link between cologne and frankfurt could provide the impetus for a europe-wide high-speed rail network . with a price tag of around 6 billion euro , the german rail system ’ s new baby has not come cheap .
but the deutsche bahn says it ’ s made history , taking only six years to build the new high-speed link between cologne and frankfurt .
after a year ’ s delay due to leaking tunnels and the construction of noise barriers , commuters are looking forward to using the link from 1 august when they 'll be able to travel at heartstopping speeds of 300 kms / hr and cut the journey between the two cities from over two hours to only seventy-six minutes .
the time saved does n't come without a sacrifice .
there 'll be no more romantic views of the rhine - one fifth of the journey will be spent speeding through tunnels , and the rest mostly through hilly sections of forest .
but passengers will be saving about one hour and as the saying goes , ‘ time is money ’ .
paying for speed a single economy ticket on the new rail link will cost 51 euro .
passengers currently pay 39 euro for the trip .
deutsche bahn admits that students and holiday-makers won ’ t welcome the price increase .
but it says it ’ s confident the new trains will be full .
deutsche bahn ’ s marketing director hartmut herdan says the aim of the service is to attract people , mainly business travellers , away from using their cars .
as much of the track runs alongside the autobahn between frankfurt and cologne , the high-speed train will be very visible competition .
gauging success german business and industry have cautiously welcomed the new rail link , but they say it ’ s too early to predict how the economy in the region will be affected .
some residents are angry that trains won ’ t be stopping in bonn , the nation ’ s former capital .
some towns along the old route fear they could tourism revenues as the new route bypasses them .
deutsche bahn has run a concerted campaign to counter opposition to the project .
the chancellor gerhard schröder will do his bit to promote the link next thursday when he will be among its first official passengers .
potential sceptics , chiefly young people , are being attracted with offers of prizes including tickets to a rock concert and opportunities to experience the journey from the train ’ s ‘ cockpit ’ .
harmonisation on track the new cologne-frankfurt link could be the centrepiece of a future europe-wide high-speed rail network .

the longest tunnel is 4.5 kms .

germany 's newly completed rail link between cologne and frankfurt could provide the impetus for a europe-wide high-speed rail network . with a price tag of around 6 billion euro , the german rail system ’ s new baby has not come cheap .
but the deutsche bahn says it ’ s made history , taking only six years to build the new high-speed link between cologne and frankfurt .
after a year ’ s delay due to leaking tunnels and the construction of noise barriers , commuters are looking forward to using the link from 1 august when they 'll be able to travel at heartstopping speeds of 300 kms / hr and cut the journey between the two cities from over two hours to only seventy-six minutes .
the time saved does n't come without a sacrifice .
there 'll be no more romantic views of the rhine - one fifth of the journey will be spent speeding through tunnels , and the rest mostly through hilly sections of forest .
but passengers will be saving about one hour and as the saying goes , ‘ time is money ’ .
paying for speed a single economy ticket on the new rail link will cost 51 euro .
passengers currently pay 39 euro for the trip .
deutsche bahn admits that students and holiday-makers won ’ t welcome the price increase .
but it says it ’ s confident the new trains will be full .
deutsche bahn ’ s marketing director hartmut herdan says the aim of the service is to attract people , mainly business travellers , away from using their cars .
as much of the track runs alongside the autobahn between frankfurt and cologne , the high-speed train will be very visible competition .
gauging success german business and industry have cautiously welcomed the new rail link , but they say it ’ s too early to predict how the economy in the region will be affected .
some residents are angry that trains won ’ t be stopping in bonn , the nation ’ s former capital .
some towns along the old route fear they could tourism revenues as the new route bypasses them .
deutsche bahn has run a concerted campaign to counter opposition to the project .
the chancellor gerhard schröder will do his bit to promote the link next thursday when he will be among its first official passengers .
potential sceptics , chiefly young people , are being attracted with offers of prizes including tickets to a rock concert and opportunities to experience the journey from the train ’ s ‘ cockpit ’ .

the company lost us $ 697m -lrb- £ 432m -rrb- in the three months to end-june , an improvement on the dramatic $ 19.4bn quarterly loss a year earlier .
nortel 's latest loss matched analysts ' estimates , but the firm warned that more trouble could be around the corner , as demand for telecoms equipment remained feeble .
nortel has already halved staff levels as telecom spending falls , and still insists it should break even within the next 12 months .
still hoping the firm said , however , that it would " actively review " its break-even target of $ 3.2bn in quarterly sales , and " redirect " unwarranted costs .
in the second quarter , its revenues tumbled 40 % to $ 2.8bn.
nortel expects further cost-cuts this year , but has not yet unveiled any fresh job losses .
in may , the firm said it would slash another 3,500 jobs by september , reducing its workforce to 42,000 .
it also said it might sell or close its fiber-optic components unit .

ebay reported net income profits of $ 54.3m -lrb- £ 34.5m -rrb- for the three months to end-june , more than double what it earned a year before , and was one of the few firms reporting on thursday to be unreservedly bullish .
" a few quarters ago it was not entirely clear what the impact of the economic slowdown would be on our business , " chief financial officer rajiv dutta said .
" now , with a few quarters under our belt , we can say that it certainly has n't hurt our business . "
ebay , which has recently gone through a phase of aggressive expansion and acquisitions , is one of the few dot.coms that enjoying strong profit growth .
cautious optimism market reaction to the news was muted , since ebay had pre-announced the figures when it acquired online payment firm paypal earlier in the month .
investors were reportedly disappointed that the firm had no fresh news to report since then .
" i think it shows that the company 's rate of growth is slowing , " said safa rashtchy of us bancorp piper jaffray .
" it is still a great company , but the element of surprise is gone and that will put the stock price under pressure since investors pay a premium for that upside . "
other analysts argued that ebay 's growth remained robust but that the company had always tried to underplay expectations .
the firm 's internal rates of growth , meanwhile , remain strong .
the company said it hosted 145.2 million auction listings during the quarter , up 47 % year on year .

" a few quarters ago it was not entirely clear what the impact of the economic slowdown would be on our business , " chief financial officer rajiv dutta said .
" now , with a few quarters under our belt , we can say that it certainly has n't hurt our business . "
ebay , which has recently gone through a phase of aggressive expansion and acquisitions , is one of the few dot.coms that enjoying strong profit growth .
cautious optimism market reaction to the news was muted , since ebay had pre-announced the figures when it acquired online payment firm paypal earlier in the month .
investors were reportedly disappointed that the firm had no fresh news to report since then .
" i think it shows that the company 's rate of growth is slowing , " said safa rashtchy of us bancorp piper jaffray .
" it is still a great company , but the element of surprise is gone and that will put the stock price under pressure since investors pay a premium for that upside . "
other analysts argued that ebay 's growth remained robust but that the company had always tried to underplay expectations .
the firm 's internal rates of growth , meanwhile , remain strong .
the company said it hosted 145.2 million auction listings during the quarter , up 47 % year on year .

here chris bird , a director of manchester city football club , recalls the day dr shipman broke the news that his mother violet had unexpectedly died .
the inquiry has ruled that the doctor killed her .
mum was just 60 when she passed away in may 1993 .
she was a very , very caring individual who would talk to everybody - the perfect kind of person to have as your mum .
we lived about a mile and a half apart , so it was very rare that a day went by where we did n't see each other or speak to each other .
chris bird : " angry is not a strong enough word " that morning she called to say that she was feeling a little bit unwell and she was expecting dr shipman out at some point .
mum suffered with rheumatoid arthritis , and she also had problems with very severe headaches for many , many years .
an hour or so later , dr shipman called me on my mobile .
he wanted me to come home straightaway .
i could hear dad in the background , he was hysterical and i just said : ' how bad is she ? '
and shipman said : ' it 's very bad . '
and i said : ' will she be ok ? '
and he said : ' no , she 's had a massive coronary and she 's passed away . '
i hung up and drove straight to the house .
suspicions raised within days of mum 's death , my wife sensed that there was something not right about the circumstances .
mum would have felt he was going to make her better because she trusted him mum had never had any heart complaints .
and if she 'd had a massive coronary , injecting her with morphine and then leaving her on her own , as dr shipman had done , was not the right thing to do .
but he 'd been our family doctor for many , many years and we found it difficult to call into question what he did and what he said .
when he was arrested five years later , we immediately thought ' no , surely not . '
dr shipman was still our family doctor , the kind of doctor we 'd always thought he was .
the once trusted gp is now in prison but as the investigation went on and suspicions grew stronger , my dad rang the police .
since then we 've been going through a real raft of emotions .
i 'm still shocked by it all and numbed by it all .
my dad is still angry and upset and confused .
and it 's not just us ; there are hundreds of people in the same boat .
even those told that their husband or wife or grandmother or grandfather was n't one of the victims will have a huge question mark - with so many killings , it would be hard to believe .
all trust gone more checks and balances need to be in place .
there should be audits done on each practice , and a patients ' body that you can talk to if you 've got any problems or any suspicions .
shipman inquiry already convicted of 15 killings 200 more patients added to toll ' real suspicion ' he killed another 45 if a doctor has had problems , then his whole profile should transfer with him when he moves .
that should be checked by an independent body and should be made public to his patients .
after all , we grow up trusting two sets of people the most : our parents and our doctor .
you ca n't put your life in somebody 's hands without knowing everything about them .
too great a loss angry is not a strong enough word for how i feel .
he 's completely wrecked the trust of many people , the faith they should have in their doctors .
i find it very difficult now to even contemplate going to a doctor and that 's wrong .
his practice won an award for charity fundraising shipman was our family gp for years .
i never had any worries about going to see him , and neither did my parents .
my mum had total faith in him and that 's the most upsetting thing .
i can visualise mum looking at him and being glad that he gave her that injection .
she would have felt he was going to make her better because she trusted him .
i do n't think i 'll ever feel there 'll be closure on this .
the man that did this is still alive , yet i 've lost a mother and a great friend .

research published on friday suggests that for every year of her life spent breastfeeding , a woman 's risk of the disease drops by 4.3 % this is on top of the 7 % reduction she enjoys for every baby to which she gives birth .
if women in the uk breastfed on average for an extra six months each , 1,000 cases of breast cancer - and hundreds of deaths - would be prevented each year .
we need to see a real shift away from the current bottle-feeding culture belinda phipps , national childbirth trust however , experts say that too few women in this country are breastfeeding their babies - partly because too little support is available to help them start .
belinda phipps , the chief executive of the national childbirth trust , said : " currently , only one in five uk mothers are still breastfeeding after six months - we know that many give up before they want to .
" it is clear that uk women are still not getting the information and support they need to breastfeed their babies .
" we need to see a real shift away from the current bottle-feeding culture in the uk to one where breastfeeding is completely accepted . "
developing world the latest study was carried out by analysts at cancer research uk , who pooled data from dozens of different studies into the benefits of breastfeeding .
differences in childbearing and breastfeeding habits could partly explain why rates of breast cancer are so low in the developing world .
on average women in the developing world breastfeed for approximately two years , and have six or seven children , as opposed to two months per child and two or three children in the uk .
professor valerie beral said : " it 's long been known that breast cancer is common in situations where women have few children and breastfeed for short periods .
" we 've shown that these factors alone account for much of the high rates of breast cancer in these settings . "
common cancer fellow researcher dr gillian reeves said : " even if women in the west were to breastfeed each of their children for an extra six months , this could prevent 5 % of breast cancers each year . "
breast cancer is now the most common cancer in women - there are well over 30,000 cases each year , and mortality is approximately a third .
a spokesman for breakthrough breast cancer said : " this study has indicated a relationship between breastfeeding and a lower risk of cancer -but more research is necessary to clearly establish a causal link .

research published on friday suggests that for every year of her life spent breastfeeding , a woman 's risk of the disease drops by 4.3 % this is on top of the 7 % reduction she enjoys for every baby to which she gives birth .
if women in the uk breastfed on average for an extra six months each , 1,000 cases of breast cancer - and hundreds of deaths - would be prevented each year . "
we need to see a real shift away from the current bottle-feeding culture " belinda phipps , national childbirth trust however , experts say that too few women in this country are breastfeeding their babies - partly because too little support is available to help them start .
belinda phipps , the chief executive of the national childbirth trust , said : " currently , only one in five uk mothers are still breastfeeding after six months - we know that many give up before they want to .
" it is clear that uk women are still not getting the information and support they need to breastfeed their babies .
" we need to see a real shift away from the current bottle-feeding culture in the uk to one where breastfeeding is completely accepted . "
developing world the latest study was carried out by analysts at cancer research uk , who pooled data from dozens of different studies into the benefits of breastfeeding .
differences in childbearing and breastfeeding habits could partly explain why rates of breast cancer are so low in the developing world .
on average women in the developing world breastfeed for approximately two years , and have six or seven children , as opposed to two months per child and two or three children in the uk .
professor valerie beral said : " it 's long been known that breast cancer is common in situations where women have few children and breastfeed for short periods .
" we 've shown that these factors alone account for much of the high rates of breast cancer in these settings . "
common cancer fellow researcher dr gillian reeves said : " even if women in the west were to breastfeed each of their children for an extra six months , this could prevent 5 % of breast cancers each year . "
breast cancer is now the most common cancer in women - there are well over 30,000 cases each year , and mortality is approximately a third .
a spokesman for breakthrough breast cancer said : " this study has indicated a relationship between breastfeeding and a lower risk of cancer -but more research is necessary to clearly establish a causal link . "

the end of production of jeans for marks & spencer at the cardigan plant will mean the loss of 325 jobs by november .
community leaders have urged action to put in place measures to minimise the impact of the job losses in the region , which is heavily dependent on the plant .
dewhirst cut 435 jobs at its swansea plant in may , moving production to morocco .
it was announced on thursday that a 90-day consultation period about the cardigan factory closure would begin on 12 august .
a woman worker , who did not wish to be named , said some workers burst into tears when they were given the news .
" we were called to meet the managers this afternoon and when we saw their faces we realised that something was wrong .
" they told us that there was no easy way to tell us , but after the holidays , we would be given 90 days notice .
" it is going to be very difficult now with 300-400 of us all going after the same jobs .
in a statement , the company said it " regretted " the decision and blamed " continued consumer pressure on prices " . " ... that has led to insufficient profitable business being available to maintain our uk manufacturing at current levels , " the statement added .
ceredigion mp simon thomas said the news was a " huge shock " and he likened the impact of the job losses to the decline of the south wales steel industry .
he said the firm had post profits of £ 23m last year and claimed the move abroad was an attempt to make more money .
" i feared this might happen .
the company is in profit but it can make more money by relocating abroad , " said mr thomas .
" the workers produced the best clothing and now they are seeing their jobs lost to cheaper countries outside the european union .
" there are no jobs available in the area in this industry . "
councillor john adams-lewis said : " this is a very dark day for cardigan .
dewhirst has been a very good employer for about 30 years and a great number of families here depend on the company . "
dewhirst 's trading position worsened this spring when it was revealed deflated high street prices meant the manufacturer had been steadily losing money for more than 18 months .
workers at the swansea plant at fforestfach , which is due to close in august , were told in may there was opportunity for relocating jobs .
dewhirst is switching production at swansea of trousers and skirts for m & s to overseas factories .
the company has been cutting its uk workforce since 1998 , when 300 jobs were lost at its ystalyfera factory near swansea .
then a further 165 jobs were lost last year when it shut its lampeter plant .
turbulent times the company has another factory at fishguard , west wales .
dewhirst 's own prospects have been closely linked to those of m & s which has experienced a turbulent period in the past two years .
in 2000 , the company also closed two plants on teesside and stoke-in-trent in england .
on those occasions , dewhirst was badly affected by the decision by m & s to transfer large parts of its clothing production outside the uk .

that is the damning verdict of a cross-party committee of mps , which lifts the lid on the savage in-fighting in stephen byers ' transport department , which led , in part , to the minister 's downfall .
when a special adviser appeared to cross the boundaries , management did not seem able to cope committee chairman tony wright ms moore sparked the row by suggesting 11 september was a good day to bury bad news , the commons public administration committee concludes .
but as the row developed , confusion reigned over who was ultimately responsible for ms moore 's employment , testing established protocols " almost to destruction " .
' generic weaknesses ' ms moore 's unpopularity within the transport department led a number of civil servants to abandon professional standards by leaking information against her , the mps say .
" management found itself unable to prevent a catastrophic taking of sides at senior level in the department , " the committee 's report says .
and there was a surprising " powerlessness " at the centre of government , which should have been ultimately responsible for employees ' conduct .
martin sixsmith : " responsibilities overlapped " " the events disclosed a disturbing number of generic weaknesses in the management of government communications .
" there is a continuing possibility that similar problems will arise elsewhere in whitehall , and the government needs to address the issues with vigour if it is to prevent a repetition .
" the lessons from these events must be learned , " the report says .
the mps call for clearer boundaries between special advisers and civil servants , which should be enshrined in a civil service act .
they also recommend a government review of the system for handling such disputes .
however , the report says there is nothing wrong with departments employing special advisers , provided they have clearly defined roles .
there was " no evidence whatsoever of a concerted attempt to politicise the civil service " , it says .
' unprofessional ' on the role of mr byers ' press chief martin sixsmith , the committee says he was faced with a substantial overlap between the work of his own staff and that of a special adviser .
" the discontent seems to have inspired a series of leaks probably , but not certainly , initiated from the press office , which were aimed at undermining ms moore .
" this serious outbreak of unprofessional behaviour was the reason given to us by -lrb- permanent secretary -rrb- sir richard mottram for mr sixsmith 's departure . "
on ms moore , the report says her activities went beyond those of other special advisers .
" the 11 september e-mail aroused the original and the greatest controversy , but other incidents also played their part .
the discontent seems to have inspired a series of leaks , probably but not certainly initiated from the press office committee 's report " the pressure she allegedly put on press officers to brief against bob kiley london 's transport commissioner was among a number of incidents perceived as marking her out from other special advisers .
" it appeared to constitute a clear breach of public service principles and the special advisers ' code .
" ignoring opportunities to pursue their grievances through the proper channels , a small number of dtlr staff leaked both information and misinformation about her activities .
" they damaged ms moore , but they also damaged the secretary of state , the department and the civil service .
they were the product of a twisted interpretation of the notion of the public interest . "
' no more spin ' committee chairman tony wright said : " the real villain was the system .
" when a special adviser appeared to cross the boundaries , management did not seem able to cope .
" career civil servants , gripped by a sense of unfairness , took the law into their own hands by leaking to the media .
" everybody was a loser , and the important issues with which the department was dealing were lost in the fog of internal war .
" the government should play it straight , and the media should play it fair .
the thing that really does need to be buried is ' spin ' . "
all of the main players in the row , including the department 's top civil servant sir richard mottram , have now left and the department has been broken up . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's jonathan beale " the report does not blame individuals " key stories blair backs ' liar ' byers byers admits mistake commons showdown moore and sixsmith quit background bleak outlook for byers timeline on spin row the row explained who said what a new civil service main players alistair darling stephen byers paul boateng andrew smith jo moore martin sixsmith talking point is stephen byers right to quit ?
